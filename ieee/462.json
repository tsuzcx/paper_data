Although previous studies have also presented quantum-based solutions for the blocking problem, the proposed schemes are characterized by an increased packet loss, a large number of quantum SWAP gates and an increased propagation delay time complexity. The current study overcomes these drawbacks by designing an N x N fully nonblocking quantum switch, in which the packet payload is passed through quantum SWAP gates while the packet header is passed through quantum control gates designed by applying a modified quantum Karnaugh mapping method. The allocation of quantum SWAP gates to the different layers within the switch is solved using a Perfect Matching in Complete Graph (PMiCG) algorithm with a time complexity of O(N!/(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N/2</sup>\n(N/2)!)).

We evaluate the insensitivity of different costs for passive binocular stereo methods with respect to radiometric variations of the input images. We consider both pixel-based and window-based variants like the absolute difference, the sampling-insensitive absolute difference, and normalized cross correlation, as well as their zero-mean versions. We also consider filters like LoG, mean, and bilateral background subtraction (BilSub) and nonparametric measures like Rank, SoftRank, Census, and Ordinal. Finally, hierarchical mutual information (HMI) is considered as pixelwise cost. Using stereo data sets with ground-truth disparities taken under controlled changes of exposure and lighting, we evaluate the costs with a local, a semiglobal, and a global stereo method. We measure the performance of all costs in the presence of simulated and real radiometric differences, including exposure differences, vignetting, varying lighting, and noise. Overall, the ranking of methods across all data sets and experiments appears to be consistent. Among the best costs are BilSub, which performs consistently very well for low radiometric differences; HMI, which is slightly better as pixelwise matching cost in some cases and for strong image noise; and Census, which showed the best and most robust overall performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5156253/04620119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156253","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Stereo Matching Costs on Images with Radiometric Differences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4620119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Stereo Matching Costs on Images with Radiometric Differences","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10773210","pubMedId":"19574620","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4620119/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Stereo Matching Costs on Images with Radiometric Differences","sourcePdf":"ttp2009091582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082558S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5156253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"466","xplore-issue":"5156253","articleId":"4620119","onlineDate":"05 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4620121,"authors":[{"name":"Greg Franks","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/4809708/4620121/4620121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Greg Franks received the PhD degree from Carleton University, where he is an assistant professor in the Department of Systems and Computer Engineering and where he has taught topics ranging from microprocessor interfacing to functional and imperative programming languages.

The model has been applied to most modern distributed systems, which use different kinds of client-server and master-slave relationships, and scales up well. The layered queueing network (LQN) model is described here in a unified fashion, including its many more extensions to match the semantics of sophisticated practical distributed and parallel systems. These include efficient representation of replicated services, parallel and quorum execution, and dependability analysis under failure and reconfiguration. The full LQN model is defined here and its solver is described. A substantial case study to an air traffic control system shows errors (compared to simulation) of a few percent. The LQN model is compared to other models and solutions, and is shown to cover all their features.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network servers","Application software","File servers","Master-slave","Failure analysis","Air traffic control","Error correction","Computational modeling","Queueing analysis","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","parallel processing","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layered queueing network","canonical form","nested multiple resource possession","distributed system","client-server system","master-slave system","semantics matching","parallel system","replicated service","quorum execution","dependability analysis","air traffic control system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance","Modeling and prediction","Queuing theory"]},{"kwd":["Performance","Modeling and prediction","Queuing theory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSE.2008.74","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/4809708/04620121.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4809708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2008.74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Modeling and Solution of Layered Queueing Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4620121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Modeling and Solution of Layered Queueing Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620121/","volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4620121/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10547535","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Modeling and Solution of Layered Queueing Networks","sourcePdf":"tts2009020148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114576S","chronDate":"March-April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"4809708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4809708","articleId":"4620121","onlineDate":"05 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4620150,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Singh","affiliation":["FERMAT Laboratory, Virginia Polytechnic and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Singh","id":"37674843300"},{"name":"Sandeep K.

In this paper, we propose faster and earlier verification of hardware designs at a level of abstraction above RTL. We consider a high-level (above RTL) hardware model that uses atomic rules to describe the behavior of a design, which can then be synthesized to RTL code. Bluespec System Verilog (BSV) is an example of such a high-level specification language. We propose a methodology for verification of BSV models using Spin, which is a Model Checking tool. Verification of high-level BSV models may avoid the need for using abstraction techniques since such models already ignore various low-level details that are irrelevant for verifying a design's behavioral properties. Moreover, using our proposed methodology different behaviors of BSV models can be efficiently verified at high-level aiding in faster verification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Checking Bluespec Specified Hardware Designs","publicationTitle":"2007 Eighth International Workshop on Microprocessor Test and Verification","doi":"10.1109/MTV.2007.9","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Eighth International Workshop on Microprocessor Test and Verification","pdfPath":"/iel5/4620135/4620136/04620150.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTV.2007.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4620136","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4620150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Model Checking Bluespec Specified Hardware Designs","conferenceDate":"5-6 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4620150/","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10220306","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Checking Bluespec Specified Hardware Designs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"3241a039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035474S","chronDate":"5-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4620135","isNumber":"4620136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4620135","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4620136","articleId":"4620150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4620168,"authors":[{"name":"Zvezditza P.

It allows each user to freely utilize multi-carrier frequency slots of V/H dual polarization. Since a VPFDM user uses V/H polarizations simultaneously, he/she doesn't share the same frequency band with other users, so that no cross-polarization interference can occur among users. This means that the requirement of polarization-tracking at the user earth station antenna can be abolished yielding more compact and economical user earth stations.

For the special case of the MIMO satellite channel, we will analytically derive a design prescript that allows for the construction of orthogonal channel matrices via the explicit positioning of two satellite antennas in the geostationary orbit. Simultaneously, a particular arrangement of an arbitrary number of ground station antennas placed on earth is assumed. In a computer simulation this conceptual design rule is illustrated and verified with a satellite communication link consisting of both a MIMO uplink channel and a MIMO downlink channel. The uplink is established between two anchor stations and a satellite system, also equipped with two antenna elements. In downlink direction the information is transferred from the two-antenna satellite system to a mobile receiver with an arbitrary number of antenna elements. The MIMO capacity optimization strategy is shown to exceed at least 90% of its theoretical maximum in all cases, nearly doubling the data rate compared to ordinary two- satellite MIMO systems, which are currently found in literature.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS.2008.19","publicationTitle":"2008 4th Advanced Satellite Mobile Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th Advanced Satellite Mobile Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4620222/4620223/04620242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS.2008.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4620223","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum-Capacity MIMO Satellite Broadcast System: Conceptual Design for LOS Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4620242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum-Capacity MIMO Satellite Broadcast System: Conceptual Design for LOS Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620242/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220321","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4620242/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum-Capacity MIMO Satellite Broadcast System: Conceptual Design for LOS Channels","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"B-05-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080365S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4620222","isNumber":"4620223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4620222","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4620223","articleId":"4620242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4620274,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluigi Liva","affiliation":["Institute of Communication and Navigation, Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft und Raumfahrt e.

Such result is achievable down to low error rates, even for small and moderate block sizes, while keeping the decoding complexity low, thanks to a class of decoding algorithms which exploits the sparseness of the parity-check matrix to reduce the complexity of Gaussian elimination (GE). In this paper the main concepts underlying ML decoding of LDPC codes are recalled. A performance analysis among various LDPC code classes is then carried out, including a comparison with fixed-rate Raptor codes. The results confirm that a judicious LDPC code design allows achieving achieving a near-optimum performance on the erasure channel, with very low error floors. Furthermore, it is shown that LDPC and Raptor codes, under ML decoding, provide almost identical performance in terms of decoding failure probability vs. overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620277/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10220334","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4620277/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity LDPC Codes with Near-Optimum Performance over the BEC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity LDPC Codes with Near-Optimum Performance over the BEC","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"B-13-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09726S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4620222","isNumber":"4620223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4620222","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4620223","articleId":"4620277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4620279,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We construct multi-class classifiers for all the image low-level feature of multimedia content description interface and their potential combinations respectively, k-nearest neighbor classifier is used as the base classifier and dasiaone vs. onepsila scheme is chosen to build multi-class classifiers. A bi-coded chromosome genetic algorithm is used to select the optimal classifier subset as weak classifiers and corresponding weights, which are used for the combination of an ensemble classifier by weighted majority voting scheme. The results of experiment over 2000 classified Corel images show that the approach selects 4 of 325 multi-class classifiers as weak classifiers as well as corresponding optimized weights to generate an ensemble classifier. The ensemble classifier created by the bi-coded chromosome genetic algorithm has higher accuracy than that by AdaBoost algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620372/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10206576","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4620372/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classifier ensemble based-on bi-coded chromosome genetic algorithm for automatic image annotation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifier ensemble based-on bi-coded chromosome genetic algorithm for automatic image annotation","confLoc":"Kunming","sourcePdf":"0612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.16288S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604641","isNumber":"4620367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604641","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4620367","articleId":"4620372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4620411,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Min Wang","affiliation":["Department of Economics and Management, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Jing-Min Wang","id":"37087603655"},{"name":"Lin Chen","affiliation":["North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Lin Chen","id":"37087300619"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4620411","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Data mining","Classification algorithms","Distance measurement","Genetic algorithms","Gallium","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithm","rules extraction","artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BDB neural network","Genetic algorithm","Rule extraction","Data mining"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4620411","abstract":"Neural networks has been widely used in data mining, but the main challenge of it is to get high efficiency and explicit knowledge.

However, how to select or combine descriptors for a specific image classification problem is still an open problem. Currently, descriptors are usually selected by human experts. Moreover, selecting the same set of descriptors for different classes of images may not be reasonable. In this work we propose a MPEG-7 descriptor selection method which selects different MPEG-7 descriptors for different image class in an image classification problem. The proposed method L-GEMIM combines Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM) and Mutual Information (MI) to assess the relevance of MPEG-7 descriptors for a particular image class. The L-GEMIM model assesses the relevance based on the generalization capability of a MPEG-7 descriptor using L-GEM and prevents redundant descriptors being selected by MI. Experimental results using 4,000 images in 4 classes show that L-GEMIM selects better set of MPEG-7 descriptors yielding a higher testing accuracy of image classification.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4620367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620448","endPage":"459","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604641/4620367/04620448.pdf","startPage":"454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPEG-7 descriptor selection using Localized Generalization Error Model with mutual information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620448/","displayDocTitle":"MPEG-7 descriptor selection using Localized Generalization Error Model with mutual information","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10206652","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4620448/","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPEG-7 descriptor selection using Localized Generalization Error Model with mutual information","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055281S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604641","isNumber":"4620367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604641","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4620367","articleId":"4620448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4620479,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Tang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Lei Tang","id":"37690062700"},{"name":"Fu-Zhen Xue","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Fu-Zhen Xue","id":"37685008300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4620479","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Particle swarm optimization","Equations","Cybernetics","Machine learning","Fuzzy sets","Evolution (biology)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-optimal fuzzy system","quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","QPSO","fuzzy rules","membership functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy System","Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization","Fuzzy Rule","Membership Function"]}],"abstract":"The design of fuzzy system is always a difficult problem.

First, potential microcalcification pixels in the mammograms are segmented out by using 4 mixed features consisting of two wavelet features and two gray level statistical features and then the potential microcalcification pixels are labeled into potential individual microcalcification objects by their spatial connectivity. Second, MCs are detected by using a set of 17 features extracted from the potential individual microcalcification objects. The classifier which is used in the first step is a multilayer feedforward neural network (NN) classifier but for the second step we have used three different classifier which are multilayer feedforward neural network (NN), SVM with polynomial kernel and SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel and the result of each classifier is obtained separately. The method is applied to a database of 40 mammograms (Nijmegen database) containing 105 clusters of MCs. A free-response operating characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the performance of CAD system with each classifier. Results show that the proposed system gives quite satisfactory detection performance. In particular, 89.55% mean true positive detection rate is achieved at the cost of 0.782, 1 and 0.95 false positive per image for neural network, support vector machine (SVM) with polynomial kernel and SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel classifiers, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620505","startPage":"756","endPage":"761","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4620480","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604641/4620480/04620505.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of SVM and neural network classifiers in automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620505/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of SVM and neural network classifiers in automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4620505/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10206708","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of SVM and neural network classifiers in automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"2657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062522S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604641","isNumber":"4620480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604641","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4620480","articleId":"4620505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4620511,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Hai Zhai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence, College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Jun-Hai Zhai","id":"37087381918"},{"name":"Su-Fang Zhang","affiliation":["Teaching and research of section of mathematics, Hebei Information Engineering School, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Su-Fang Zhang","id":"37087381784"},{"name":"Li-Juan Liu","affiliation":["Teaching and research of section of mathematics, Hebei Information Engineering School, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Li-Juan Liu","id":"37087434315"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4620511","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Transforms","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet coefficients","Artificial neural networks","Image recognition","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image recognition","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","wavelet transform","artificial neural networks","features extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image recognition","Wavelet transform","Artificial neural networks","Multi-scale features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4620511","abstract":"This paper proposes an image recognition method, which consists of two steps: features extraction based on wavelet transform and image recognition using artificial neural networks.

Therefore, evaluating a classifier by very different unseen samples may be counter-productive. In the L-GEM, the ldquolocalrdquo is defined by the difference between feature values of unseen samples and training samples is less than a given real value (Q). The L-GEM provides an upper bound of the mean-square-error of unseen samples ldquolocalrdquo to the training dataset. As the generalization capability of a MLPNN is the key evaluation criterion of a successful training of MLPNN, we select the number of hidden neurons of a MLPNN using the L-GEM. The experimental results on four UCI datasets show that the proposed L-GEM yields better MLPNNs with higher generalization power (testing accuracy) and smaller number of hidden neurons.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620512/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10206715","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4620512/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Localized generalization error model for Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localized generalization error model for Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kunming","sourcePdf":"3858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069124S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604641","isNumber":"4620480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604641","xplore-issue":"4620480","articleId":"4620512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4620514,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Nong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yu-Nong Zhang","id":"37087434398"},{"name":"Xiao-Jiao Guo","affiliation":["School of Software, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xiao-Jiao Guo","id":"37087433285"},{"name":"Wei-Mu Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Wei-Mu Ma","id":"37087434395"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4620514","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Cybernetics","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","digital simulation","mathematics computing","matrix algebra","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Zhang neural network","online linear time-varying equations","MATLAB","Simulink","recurrent neural network","online time-varying algebraic equations","neural dynamics","matrix-valued error-monitoring function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent neural network","implicit dynamics","time-varying linear equations","MATLAB Simulink modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4620514","abstract":"Recently, a general recurrent neural network (RNN) with implicit dynamics has been proposed by Zhang et al for online time-varying algebraic equations solving; namely Zhang neural network (ZNN).

To date, most of probabilistic plan algorithms have only focused on single objective formulations that bound one of the objectives by making some unnatural assumptions.

To obtain better performance, a self-adaptive PID control is applied to the exhaust temperature control. The parameters of PID control are tuned by radial basis function (RBF) neural network. In this paper, the RBF neural network is given which has been used extensively in the areas of pattern recognition, systems modeling and identification. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated by applying it to the exhaust temperature control. The simulations show that the dynamic responses of the exhaust control system can be effectively improved and the anti-disturbance of the proposed controller is better than that of the PID controller. However, the learning rate of RBF neural network and PID parameters is not too large due to the great gain of micro gas turbine. Otherwise the output will surge acutely.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620758","startPage":"2131","endPage":"2136","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604641/4620699/04620758.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4620699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-adaptive RBF neural network PID control in exhaust temperature of micro gas turbine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Turbines","Temperature control","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Cogeneration","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gas turbines","learning systems","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","self-adjusting systems","temperature control","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-adaptive radial basis function neural network","PID control","micro gas turbine","mathematical model","exhaust temperature control","dynamic responses","learning rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radial basis function(RBF)","Neural network","PID control","Self-adaptive","Exhaust temperature control","Micro gas turbine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Self-adaptive RBF neural network PID control in exhaust temperature of micro gas turbine","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4620758/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10206959","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-adaptive RBF neural network PID control in exhaust temperature of micro gas turbine","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"2592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062432S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2008","isNumber":"4620699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604641","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4620758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4620762,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Peng Chi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Zhi-Peng Chi","id":"37690626100"},{"name":"Zheng-Ping Zhao","affiliation":["Micro/Nano Technology Center, Hebei Semiconductor Research Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Zheng-Ping Zhao","id":"37695660300"},{"name":"Ning Li","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Ning Li","id":"37695860300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4620762","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Transducers","Mathematical model","Piezoelectric transducers","Computational modeling","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic transducers","acoustic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","Newton method","piezoelectric transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoelectric transducers","finite-difference time-domain method","electromechanical phenomena","Newton equation","particle velocity","particle stress signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD method","Piezoelectric transducers"]}],"abstract":"Based on the works of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to the piezoelectrics, we have extended this method to analyze electromechanical phenomena of one-dimensional multilayer piezoelectric transducers for the first time.

The model is applied to analyze the influence of thickness of the matching layer on the receiver voltages, and the propagation of particle velocity and the particle stress signals are demonstrated in space-time.

Here we consider eye blink as an evidence of liveness to exclude using some fakes, mainly 2D photographs, to spoof face recognition systems. The detection of eye blink is done by signal analysis of multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor responses of eye images. First, based on Gabor decomposition, we derive multiple Gabor response waves (GRW) and show some of them are homo-responsive to the behavior of eye blink. Second, probable blinking signals contained in GRWs are segmented out and reshaped into pulses. Third, the ratio of the union to the intersection (RUI) of the reshaped pulses is proposed as the indicator of the extent of eye blink.

This paper uses the pruning scheme to optimize neural network structure. The genetic algorithm is used to find out the optimum node pruning. In the conventional researches, the input and hidden layers were optimized separately. On the contrary we attempted to optimize the two layers simultaneously by encoding two layers in a chromosome. The offspring networks inherit the weights from the parent. For learning, we used the existing error back-propagation algorithm. In our experiment with various databases from UCI Machine Learning Repository, we could get the peak performance when the network size was reduced by about 8~25%. As a result of t-test the proposed method was shown to have a better performance, compared with other pruning or construction methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620997","startPage":"3428","endPage":"3433","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604641/4620933/04620997.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4620933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous node pruning of input and hidden layers using genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Machine learning","Classification algorithms","Cybernetics","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","genetic algorithms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous node pruning","input layers","hidden layers","genetic algorithms","neural network structure","constructive scheme","error back-propagation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimization of Neural Networks","Genetic Algorithm","Node Pruning","Cross-Validation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4620997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous node pruning of input and hidden layers using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10207132","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous node pruning of input and hidden layers using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Kunming","sourcePdf":"3800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049917S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2008","isNumber":"4620933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604641","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4620997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4621014,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Liu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Huan Liu","id":"37695425800"},{"name":"Wei Pan","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Wei Pan","id":"37686558300"},{"name":"Shui-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Shui-Sheng Lin","id":"37692899200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4621014","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital multimedia broadcasting","Field programmable gate arrays","IP networks","Fabrics","Computer architecture","Clocks","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable FFT processor","fast Fourier transform","Xilinx Virtex2p FPGA","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable","FFT","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"A high-speed reconfigurable FFT architecture based on FPGA is proposed in this paper.

Then the fused closest point is obtained by fusing radar observations and the vision closest point. Next by translating the fitted contour to the fused closest point, the fused contour is obtained. Finally the fused contour is tracked by using the rigid body constraints to estimate the location, size, pose and motion of the threat vehicle.

It uses Bayespsila rule to estimate the posterior for the presence of a pedestrian in a certain (rectangular) image region, based on motion parallax features. This posterior is used as a parameter to control the amount of regions of interest (ROIs) that is passed to subsequent verification stages. For the latter, we use a state-of-the-art pedestrian recognition scheme which consists of multiple modules in a cascade architecture. We obtain optimized settings for the control parameters of the combined cascade system by a sequential ROC convex hull technique. Experiments are conducted on image data captured from a moving vehicle in an urban environment. We demonstrate that the proposed focus-of-attention strategy reduces the false positives of an otherwise identical monocular pedestrian recognition system by a factor of two, at equal detection rates. The overall system maintains processing rates close to real-time.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2008.4621169","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607789/4621124/04621169.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2008.4621169","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","startPage":"792","endPage":"797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monocular pedestrian recognition using motion parallax","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Monocular pedestrian recognition using motion parallax","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621169/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621169/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10207317","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monocular pedestrian recognition using motion parallax","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060317S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607789","isNumber":"4621124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607789","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4621124","articleId":"4621169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4621181,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For example, collision mitigation brake systems detect the distance and relative velocity of vehicles in front to assess the risk of a rear-end collision in a clearly defined following situation. In order to go beyond such elementary analysis tasks, todaypsilas research is focusing more and more on powerful perception systems for driver assistance. We believe computer vision will play a central role for achieving a full understanding of generic traffic situations. Besides individual processing algorithms, general vision architectures enabling integrated and more flexible processing are needed. Here we present the first instantiation of a vision architecture for driver assistance systems inspired by the human visual system that is based on task-dependent perception. Core element of our system is a state of the art attention system integrating bottom-up and top-down visual saliency. Combining this task-dependent tunable visual saliency with object recognition and tracking enables for instance warnings according to the context of the scene. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in a construction site setup, where a traffic jam ending within the site is a dangerous situation that the system has to identify in order to warn the driver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a human-like vision system for Driver Assistance","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2008.4621227","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607789/4621124/04621227.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2008.4621227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621124","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Towards a human-like vision system for Driver Assistance","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621227/","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10220105","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a human-like vision system for Driver Assistance","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065258S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607789","isNumber":"4621124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607789","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4621124","articleId":"4621227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4621233,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Distinctive image features, so called interest points, were extracted in each image of the sequences and tracked using a Kalman filter. The interest points are then organized in a undirected graph. This connected structure can be used to describe the spatial relationship of interest points. An edge scoring algorithm is introduced that favors edges connecting interest points lying on the same object and punishing bridging edges, e.q. edges connecting different objects. To do so, we will introduce our so called ldquohomogeneous scale assumptionrdquo that is used to calculate scores for each edge in the graph. The resulting connected sub-structures in the graph are mathematically described by a radial map and then again tracked using a Kalman filter to further increase robustness. The presented algorithm is capable of working at 30 Hz and is thus feasible in a wide variety of applications.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2008.4621239","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607789/4621124/04621239.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2008.4621239","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion segmentation using interest points","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Motion segmentation using interest points","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621239/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621239/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10220114","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion segmentation using interest points","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051443S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607789","isNumber":"4621124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607789","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4621124","articleId":"4621239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4621252,"authors":[{"name":"Anselm Haselhoff","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical, Information and Media Engineering,Chairof Communication Theory, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Anselm","lastName":"Haselhoff","id":"37541107900"},{"name":"Sam Schauland","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical, Information and Media Engineering,Chairof Communication Theory, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Schauland","id":"37541101200"},{"name":"Anton Kummert","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical, Information and Media Engineering,Chairof Communication Theory, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Kummert","id":"37269365300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2568-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2569-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"4621252","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621252","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","feature extraction","image classification","image resolution","image sampling","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal theoretic approach","image resolution","appearance-based vehicle detection","image classification","appearance-based object detection algorithms","sampling theory","feature extraction","AdaBoost algorithm","driver assistance systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVS.2008.4621252","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607789/4621124/04621252.pdf","startPage":"822","endPage":"827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2008.4621252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signal theoretic approach to measure the influence of image resolution for appearance-based vehicle detection","abstract":"In this work a framework to measure the influence of training image resolution on classification performance for appearance-based object detection algorithms is presented. It is shown that based on sampling theory a reasonable image resolution for feature extraction can be chosen in advance, that is prior to the time consuming feature extraction and testing of the classifier. This is possible due to measuring the signal energy that is preserved in a low resolution image with respect to the optimal case of a high resolution image. The approach is justified using an AdaBoost algorithm with Haar-like features for vehicle detection. Tests of classifiers, trained with different resolutions, are performed and the results are presented. These results reveal that there is a good tradeoff between classification performance and computational load. The presented framework helps choosing a resolution for a good description of the training data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4621252/","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10220126","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A signal theoretic approach to measure the influence of image resolution for appearance-based vehicle detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal theoretic approach to measure the influence of image resolution for appearance-based vehicle detection","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051457S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607789","isNumber":"4621124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607789","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4621124","articleId":"4621252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4621260,"authors":[{"name":"Moritz Werling","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science/Automation, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Moritz","lastName":"Werling","id":"37542759200"},{"name":"Tobias Gindele","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Gindele","id":"37542786000"},{"name":"Daniel Jagszent","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Jagszent","id":"37694777300"},{"name":"Lutz Groll","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH (FZK), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Groll","id":"37424640300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2568-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2569-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"4621260","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles","road traffic","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["urban scenarios","moving traffic handling","autonomous vehicle","Urban Challenge 2007 competition","dynamic passing","high-level decision process"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes an algorithm for handling moving traffic which was deployed on AnnieWAY, an autonomous vehicle successfully entering the finals of the DARPA Urban Challenge 2007 competition.

The main goal of the research is to determine what characteristics are desirable for improved training and validation of pedestrian detectors and classifiers. The work focuses on those aspects of the dataset which affect classification success using the most common boosting methods. Dataset characteristics such as image size, aspect ratio, geometric variance and the relative scale of positive class instances (pedestrians) within the training window form an integral part of classification success. This paper will examine the effects of varying these dataset characteristics with a view to determining the recommended attributes of a high quality and challenging dataset. While the primary focus is on characteristics of the positive training dataset, some discussion of desirable attributes for the negative dataset is important and is therefore included. This paper also serves to publish our current pedestrian dataset in various forms for non-commercial use by the scientific community. We believe the published dataset to be one of the largest, most flexible, and representative datasets available for pedestrian/person detection tasks.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2008.4621297","startPage":"373","endPage":"378","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607789/4621124/04621297.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2008.4621297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new pedestrian dataset for supervised learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pedestrian dataset","supervised learning","pedestrian detectors","positive training dataset","negative dataset","pedestrian classifiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new pedestrian dataset for supervised learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621297/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10220163","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new pedestrian dataset for supervised learning","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075855S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607789","isNumber":"4621124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607789","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4621124","articleId":"4621297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4621301,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Miller","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Alaska, Anchorage, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Miller","id":"37401352500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2568-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2569-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"4621301","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","road traffic","road vehicles","traffic information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle-to-vehicle-to-infrastructure","intelligent transportation system architecture","distributed architecture","super vehicle detection algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, I describe the vehicle-to-vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2V2I) architecture, which is a hybrid of the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) architectures.

Path planning is posed as a graph search problem. The search graph is set up in a way that implies derivation of a feed forward term for a downstream closed loop controller. An informed search algorithm is used that is guided by a heuristic cost function that accounts for both kinematic constraints of the vehicle and the topology of the vehiclepsilas free space.

In this paper, we present a new 3D tracking algorithm and integrate it into HyHOPE, a real-time (30 fps) hybrid head orientation and position estimation system for driver head tracking. With a single video camera, the system continuously tracks the head in six degrees-of-freedom, initializing itself automatically with separate modules for head detection and head pose estimation. The tracking module provides a fine estimate of the 3D motion of the head, using a new appearance-based algorithm for 3D model tracking by particle filtering in an augmented reality environment. We describe our implementation, which utilizes OpenGL-optimized graphics hardware to efficiently compute particle samples in real-time. To quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of our system, we compare its estimation results to a marker-based cinematic motion capture system installed in an automotive testbed. We evaluate the system on real daytime and nighttime drives with drivers of varying ages, race, and sex.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","pose estimation","tracking","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid head orientation and position estimation","vision-based driver head tracking","driver distraction","automotive collisions","position estimation system","hybrid head orientation","appearance-based algorithm","3D model tracking","particle filtering","OpenGL-optimized graphics hardware","cinematic motion capture system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVS.2008.4621320","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607789/4621124/04621320.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2008.4621320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HyHOPE: Hybrid Head Orientation and Position Estimation for vision-based driver head tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"HyHOPE: Hybrid Head Orientation and Position Estimation for vision-based driver head tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621320/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621320/","accessionNumber":"10220181","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HyHOPE: Hybrid Head Orientation and Position Estimation for vision-based driver head tracking","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072092S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607789","isNumber":"4621124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607789","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4621124","articleId":"4621320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4621325,"authors":[{"name":"David A.

The need for assistance systems arises from the fallibility of the visual feedback loop, for example due to inattention. Existing driver assistance systems either automate the car-following task or support drivers with binary warning systems to redirect their attention when necessary. The goal of this paper is to discuss the benefits and limitations of these systems, and to show the possibilities of an alternative design approach. To attain the goal, a theoretic analysis is presented, that views car following as a closed-loop control task that requires sufficient feedback about the separation (relative distance, relative velocity) to a lead vehicle. A task analysis helps to identify the areas where the current systems assist the driver well, and where they do not. The new design approach aims to keep the human in the loop, by supplementing the semi-continuous visual feedback loop with an additional continuous feedback loop, namely haptic feedback applied directly at the gas pedal. Expected benefits compared to existing systems include: better situation awareness (even during periods of visual inattention) and faster responses (the haptic feedback is available directly at the gas pedal, allowing the use of fast reflexes). Several design issues are presented, such as the prevention of nuisance and fatigue, deciding which separation states the feedback is based upon, and challenges in determining the correct characteristics of the haptic signals. The benefits of the approach are illustrated through several examples from literature that describe experimental humanin-the-loop studies with continuous haptic feedback. It is concluded that haptic feedback on the gas pedal is a promising way of supporting drivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10207344","htmlLink":"/document/4621325/","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Motivation for continuous haptic gas pedal feedback to support car following","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motivation for continuous haptic gas pedal feedback to support car following","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073752S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607789","isNumber":"4621124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607789","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4621124","articleId":"4621325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4621370,"authors":[{"name":"Keqin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37404374000"},{"name":"Qing Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277327400"},{"name":"Yunxia Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yunxia","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281021500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621370","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Throughput","Joints","Ad hoc networks","Synchronization","Conferences","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","Markov processes","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensing","cognitive radio networks","ad hoc network","secondary users searching","idle frequency bands","multiple channels","intelligent channel selection","common control channels","decentralized partially observable Markov decision process","suboptimal randomized sensing policy","network throughput","optimal single-user design"]}],"abstract":"We consider an ad hoc network of secondary users searching for idle frequency bands in a spectrum consisting of multiple channels. In each slot, a secondary user chooses one channel to sense and decide whether to access based on the sensing outcome. A sensing strategy for intelligent channel selection is crucial to track the rapidly varying spectrum opportunities. In an ad hoc network without a central controller or common control channels, a secondary user can only resort to its local observations in the decision making. The tradeoff is between choosing the channel most likely to be idle and avoiding other competing secondary users. We show that the problem can be formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A suboptimal randomized sensing policy is then proposed. This policy effectively addresses this design tradeoff and offers significant improvement in network throughput over the optimal single-user design.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.11","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621370.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.11","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","startPage":"28","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Sensing and Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Sensing and Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621370/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621370/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220349","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Sensing and Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-01-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066573S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4621377,"authors":[{"name":"Johnny W.

The paper targets the optimum power allocation and link scheduling of the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) schemes. A heuristic relaxation is used to simplify the NP-hard problem of the joint optimization between power control and link scheduling into the power controlled random access (PCRA) problem. PCRA problem is transformed to convex optimization problem through the geometric programming. For a single cell uplink system with imperfect frequency synchronization, OFDMA outperforms CDMA significantly. OFDMA uplink system requires 22% less transmit power than CDMA for the proposed scheme. Furthermore it has been found that a high subcarrier granularity is advantageous and results in less Pareto optimum transmit power.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621378.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Pareto Optimum Transmit Power between CDMA and OFDMA Uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Optimization","OFDM","Power control","Interference","Mobile communication","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimum transmit power","CDMA uplink","OFDMA uplink","multiple access techniques","cellular mobile communication systems","optimum power allocation","link scheduling","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","code division multiple access","heuristic relaxation","joint optimization","power controlled random access","convex optimization problem","geometric programming","single cell uplink system","frequency synchronization","subcarrier granularity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Pareto Optimum Transmit Power between CDMA and OFDMA Uplink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621378/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220354","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Pareto Optimum Transmit Power between CDMA and OFDMA Uplink","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-03-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049052S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4621379,"authors":[{"name":"Taufik Abrao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of Londrina, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Taufik","lastName":"Abrao","id":"37270219700"},{"name":"Fernando Ciriaco","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of Londrina, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Ciriaco","id":"37299832100"},{"name":"Leonardo D.

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) with weighting particle position based on combining multi-fitness functions (woPSO) is proposed and compared with the conventional PSO SIMO MC-CDMA. The woPSO strategy deal with the multi-objective dilemma imposed by the spatial diversity that results in independent likelihood function for each receive antenna.

At a given coverage, the efficiency of conventional MBMS is limited by low SNR users as, e.g., users located close to a cell edge, which are typically suffering from bad channel and inter-cell interference conditions. As a means to mitigate the situations of such users, multicast/broadcast single frequency network (MBSFN) operation has recently been specified in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as an enhancement of MBMS. In WCDMA downlinks as considered here, MBSFN operation refers to the coherent use of a single common scrambling code and the same spreading codes to simultaneously broadcast identical MBMS channels in a number of cells that form an MBMS cluster. Through this, the users receive the signals from the cluster of MBSFN cells as one single signal over a joint radio channel, which exchanges inter-cell interference by constructive multi-path signals. This can be exploited by advanced receivers to yield impressive receiver output SNR gains as compared to conventional MBMS. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the spectral efficiencies achievable in MBSFN and conventional MBMS. The results help to assess whether it is expedient to enhance WCDMA by MBSFN.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621381.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Multicast/Broadcast Single Frequency Network Operation for WCDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Equalizers","Multiaccess communication","Receiving antennas","Spread spectrum communication","Receivers","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband networks","cellular radio","code division multiple access","multicast communication","multimedia communication","radio links","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","multicast/broadcast single frequency network operation","WCDMA","multimedia broadcast/multicast services","3GPP","single common scrambling code","joint radio channel","intercell interference","Third Generation Partnership Project","spreading codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Multicast/Broadcast Single Frequency Network Operation for WCDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621381/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220357","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Multicast/Broadcast Single Frequency Network Operation for WCDMA","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-03-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064919S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4621382,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Gpe.

This paper proposed a novel modified SE algorithm for iterative spatial multiplexing multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) receiver to estimate the maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability of the received symbol sequence. In addition, two schemes are proposed to further improve the performance and reduce the complexity over iterations, one is to improve the ZF-DFE estimate by using the quadratic approximation of a priori information, the other is to improve the tree search by employing starting point zig-zag technique. Simulation results show that significant performance gain and complexity reduction can be obtained compared to existing SE approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621388.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Schnorr-Euchner Sphere Decoding for Iterative Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiplexing","Iterative decoding","Detectors","Maximum likelihood decoding","Decoding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","iterative methods","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio receivers","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified Schnorr-Euchner decoding","sphere decoding","spatial multiplexing","MIMO receiver","computation complexity","sphere decoders","near-maximum likelihood detection","maximum-a-posteriori probability","symbol sequence","iterations","quadratic approximation","starting point zig-zag technique","tree search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modified Schnorr-Euchner Sphere Decoding for Iterative Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Receiver","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621388/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220361","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Schnorr-Euchner Sphere Decoding for Iterative Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Receiver","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-05-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073516S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4621389,"authors":[{"name":"Laurence Mailaender","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Wireless Communications Research Department, Alcatel-Lucent Technologies, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Laurence","lastName":"Mailaender","id":"37284412700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621389","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Gain","Channel estimation","MIMO","Noise","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor network MIMO","regularized zero-forcing transmission","other-cell interference","zero-forcing transmission","sum-power constraints","per-antenna power constraints","outdoor systems"]}],"abstract":"Network MIMO uses the coherent coordination of the transmitted signals from a cluster of bases to greatly reduce other-cell interference and improve spectral efficiency.

This criterion may be used to select a finite number of codes from a given codeset in quasi-synchronous environment. It is found that with the proposed criterion there is about 0.9 dB and 2 dB improvement in BER performance at synchronization errors of 0.1 Tc and 0.2 Tc respectively for WH codes of length 64, compared to random selection of codes.

The key feature of MIMO MC-CDMA is the capability of exploiting diversity jointly in time, frequency and space domains. In particular, Alamouti's coding scheme has been proposed as a very simple and mathematically elegant tool in order to implement space-time block coding. The main problem to be addressed is to effectively recombine diversity in order to achieve the best performances in the presence of multi-user interference. In this paper, we are proposing a low-complexity linear multi-user receiver based on the MMSE criterion supported by a genetic-algorithm (GA)-assisted MMSE channel estimation.

In particular, we compare the throughputs in a situation where hidden terminals are no longer negligible. We encounter the situation in an intersection where two or more cars are crossing by. Due to the hidden terminal degradation, poor throughput performance is obtained with OFDM scheme. On the other hand, MC-CDMA has a resistance to the hidden terminals as it can support simultaneous packets. However, the transmission data rate is much slow because of the spreading. Thus the total throughput may not be as high as the OFDM. As results, we show that throughput of the OFDM is better than the MC-CDMA in a low traffic region. We found that the OFDM can communicate only with the nearest car. On the contrary, when the traffic is high, the MC-CDMA shows better throughput than the OFDM. In addition, we show that many packets can be received simultaneously in MC-CDMA. These results lead to the conclusion that when we want high-speed communication to a few cars, the OFDM is a good candidate. And when low speed but simultaneous communication with many surrounding cars is our desire, then the MC-CDMA is our choice. As MC-CDMA has a compatibility with an OFDM by setting a spreading factor to one, MC-CDMA system may be the preferable choice for IVC.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.40","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621399.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDMA Slotted ALOHA System with Successive Interference Cancellation for Inter-Vehicle Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621399/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CDMA Slotted ALOHA System with Successive Interference Cancellation for Inter-Vehicle Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621399/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10220367","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDMA Slotted ALOHA System with Successive Interference Cancellation for Inter-Vehicle Communications","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-07-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073029S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621400,"authors":[{"name":"Shunsuke Horii","affiliation":["Waseda University, Okubo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Horii","id":"37699474700"},{"name":"Tota Suko","affiliation":["Waseda University, Okubo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tota","lastName":"Suko","id":"37697675500"},{"name":"Toshiyasu Matsushima","affiliation":["Waseda University, Okubo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiyasu","lastName":"Matsushima","id":"37285749800"},{"name":"Shigeichi Hirasawa","affiliation":["Waseda University, Okubo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeichi","lastName":"Hirasawa","id":"37296692600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621400","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Detectors","Inference algorithms","Belief propagation","Approximation methods","Multiaccess communication","Multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","multiuser detection","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection algorithm","CDMA","belief propagation algorithm","multiuser code-division multiple-access channel","parallel interference canceller"]}],"abstract":"Optimum detection for the multiuser code-division multiple-access channel is prohibitively complex.

It was the only fact that the parallel interference canceller is derived as an approximation of the belief propagation. In this paper, we show that the belief propagation algorithm can be applied to the detection problem by converting the factor graph structure.

Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless communication systems are shown to yield significant performance improvement to data rates when compared to the traditional single input single output (SISO) wireless systems. The benefits of multiple antenna elements at the transmitter and receiver have become necessary to the research and the development of the next generation of mobile communication systems.

For this purpose, we study the tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency (known as the power-bandwidth tradeoff) in a wideband linear multihop network in which transmissions employ orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and are affected by quasi-static, frequency-selective fading. Considering open-loop (fixed-rate) and closed-loop (rate-adaptive) multihop relaying techniques, we characterize the impact of routing with spatial reuse on the statistical properties of the end-to-end conditional mutual information (conditioned on the specific values of the channel fading parameters and therefore treated as a random variable) and on the energy and spectral efficiency measures of the wideband regime. Our analysis particularly deals with the convergence of these end-to-end performance measures in the case of large number of hops, i.e., the phenomenon first observed in [1] and named as \"multihop diversity\".

Considering discrete complex input alphabets, the transmitter is assumed to comprise a linear front-end combined with nonlinear precoding, that minimizes the transmit energy penalty imposed by the linear front-end. The energy penalty is minimized by relaxing the input alphabet to a larger alphabet set prior to precoding. The so-called \"replica method\" of statistical physics is employed to derive the limiting empirical distribution of the precoder's output, as well as the limiting energy penalty. Particularizing to a \"zero-forcing\" (ZF) linear front-end, and non- cooperative users, a decoupling result is derived according to which the channel observed by each of the individual receivers can be characterized by the Markov chain u-x-y, where u is the channel input, x is the equivalent precoder output, and y is the channel output. A comparative spectral efficiency analysis of two illustrative examples reveals significant performance gains compared to linear ZF precoding in the medium to high Et/No region. In particular, we demonstrate that convex extended alphabets, amenable to efficient energy minimization algorithms, provide an attractive alternative to alphabets based on the discrete Gaussian integer lattice, for which the energy minimization problem is NP-hard.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621407.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"236","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Spectral Efficiency of Vector Precoding for Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Limiting","Transmitters","Vectors","Receivers","Physics","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","Gaussian channels","Markov processes","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency","vector precoding","Gaussian MIMO broadcast channels","multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel","discrete complex input alphabets","zero-forcing linear front-end","Markov chain","discrete Gaussian integer lattice"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On Spectral Efficiency of Vector Precoding for Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220372","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Spectral Efficiency of Vector Precoding for Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-09-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065121S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621408,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Eslami","affiliation":["TRLabs, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37296955700"},{"name":"Witold A.

However, this increase is only achieved with proper transmission techniques which schedule the best set of users and distribute resources according to each user's channel condition. In this paper, a multiuser MIMO-OFDM technique based on partial CSI is presented for broadcast channels, which achieves a greatly increased system throughput. In the proposed scheme, the base station schedules transmission to a subset of users and allocates data streams on each antenna and subcarrier to users based on their received partial CSI. A combination of eigenmode transmission and zero-forcing (ZF) receiver processing is used to separate spatial layers on each subcarrier. The results show the proposed scheme's advantage over limited feedback linear ZF receiver processing and frequency division multiplexing (FDM).

Having only few external parameters, it is particularly interesting for signal processing engineers wanting to test their algorithms against realistic channels. A current shortcoming of the COST 273 MIMO channel model is its missing parametrisation for a number of scenarios. Particularly, the parametrisation of the cluster parameters is challenging, even more, since three different kinds of clusters are used to model the channel. This paper outlines an approach to consistently parametrise the clusters used in the COST 273 MIMO channel model from representative measurement data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The COST 273 MIMO Channel Model: Three Kinds of Clusters","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.57","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621416.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"The COST 273 MIMO Channel Model: Three Kinds of Clusters","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621416/","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220378","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The COST 273 MIMO Channel Model: Three Kinds of Clusters","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-11-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081806S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4621423,"authors":[{"name":"Lennert Jacobs","affiliation":["TELIN Department, DIGCOM Research Group, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lennert","lastName":"Jacobs","id":"37410159100"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["TELIN Department, DIGCOM Research Group, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37269902700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621423","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621423","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the effect of imperfect channel estimation on the bit error rate (BER) performance of orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs).

We consider a mismatched maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver, which estimates the channel matrix from known pilot symbols according to a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion, and uses the channel estimate in the symbol-by-symbol detection algorithm as if it were the true channel matrix. For both PAM and QAM constellations and OSTBCs satisfying a proposed criterion, we present simple exact closed-form expressions for the BER of the mismatched receiver and the corresponding BER degradation as compared to a receiver that knows the true channel matrix. For OSTBCs that do not satisfy this criterion, a simple approximation of the BER and the associated BER degradation is derived, assuming PAM and QAM constellations. By means of computer simulations, this approximation is shown to be very accurate.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","startPage":"318","endPage":"323","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621423.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate BER Analysis of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes with MMSE Channel Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Receivers","Channel estimation","Receiving antennas","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Fading","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","error statistics","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER analysis","orthogonal space-time block codes","MMSE channel estimation","bit error rate","OSTBC","multiple-input multiple-output propagation channel","MIMO","maximum-likelihood receiver","minimum mean-square error criterion","symbol-by-symbol detection","PAM","QAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Accurate BER Analysis of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes with MMSE Channel Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621423/","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621423/","accessionNumber":"10220382","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate BER Analysis of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes with MMSE Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-13-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053776S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4621424,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Le Guellaut","affiliation":["IETR, INSA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Le Guellaut","id":"37697701500"},{"name":"Fabienne Nouvel","affiliation":["IETR, INSA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Fabienne","lastName":"Nouvel","id":"37265979300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621424","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Encoding","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Antennas","Field programmable gate arrays","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","field programmable gate arrays","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM system","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","space-time block coder","transmit antennas","customized space-time block coder"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the field of implementation of communication systems with field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

However, in TDD interference-limited systems, conventional channel sounding pilots only provide instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), but knowledge about the level of the interference at the receiver cannot be obtained. Therefore, a scheduler cannot optimally exploit the available degree of freedom (DoF) in order to maximize the system capacity (e.g. the downlink (DL) sum capacity). In this paper, a novel interference feedback scheme is proposed to provide the base station (BS) with implicit knowledge about the interference level received by each mobile station (MS). It is proposed to weight the uplink channel sounding pilots by the level of the received interference at each MS. The weighted uplink channel sounding pilots act as a bandwidth-efficient and delay-efficient means for providing the BS with both, CSIT and the level of interference received by each active user. The performance of a system using weighted sounding pilots is compared against a system using non- weighted sounding pilots for both greedy (maximum capacity) as well as fair scheduling criteria such as proportional fair and score based scheduling policies. It is shown that the throughput is increased while fairness is not compromised.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621426.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implicit Pilot-Borne Interference Feedback for Multiuser MIMO TDD Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Directive antennas","Antennas","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","time division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["implicit pilot-borne interference feedback","multiuser MIMO TDD systems","closed-loop future time division duplex","uplink channel sounding method","interference-limited systems","channel state information at the transmitter","CSIT","degree of freedom","bandwidth-efficiency","delay-efficiency","weighted sounding pilots","fair scheduling criteria"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Implicit Pilot-Borne Interference Feedback for Multiuser MIMO TDD Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621426/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220384","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implicit Pilot-Borne Interference Feedback for Multiuser MIMO TDD Systems","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-13-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044651S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4621427,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Lan Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Lan","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37690705100"},{"name":"Sau-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sau-Gee","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277602600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621427","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","MIMO","Decoding","Artificial neural networks","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid sphere decoding algorithm","MIMO systems","MIMO data detection methods","maximum-likelihood detection algorithm","computational complexity","depth-first search SD","breadth-first search SD","layer reordered method"]}],"abstract":"For MIMO data detection methods, sphere decoding (SD) algorithms have been shown to achieve similar performance to the maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) algorithm with acceptable computational complexity.

These estimators are useful for a general class of receivers resorting to a time-frequency signal representation of the received signal - obtained by, e.g., a filter bank - which have recently been considered in the context of reconfigurable radio. Taking advantage of the Kronecker product properties we derive two-dimensional filter formulations for doubly-dispersive channel estimation, which afford implementations with moderate complexities. Rank reduction and the use of fast Fourier transform methods are shown to offer further complexity reductions. The different estimator variants are compared in terms of MSE performance and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","startPage":"381","endPage":"385","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621435.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.76","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Two-Dimensional Filters for Doubly-Dispersive Channel Estimation in Time-Frequency Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Covariance matrix","OFDM","Delay","Complexity theory","Filter bank","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","channel estimation","least mean squares methods","multidimensional digital filters","signal representation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional filters","doubly-dispersive channel estimation","time-frequency signal processing","minimum mean squared error","MSE","unknown data signals","time-frequency signal representation","filter bank","rank reduction","fast Fourier transform methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Two-Dimensional Filters for Doubly-Dispersive Channel Estimation in Time-Frequency Signal Processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621435/","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621435/","accessionNumber":"10220389","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Two-Dimensional Filters for Doubly-Dispersive Channel Estimation in Time-Frequency Signal Processing","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-15-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038596S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621440,"authors":[{"name":"Navid Hassanpour","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Navid","lastName":"Hassanpour","id":"37563685600"},{"name":"John E.

The beamforming weights are computed in a distributed manner at each transmit sector antenna array without the need for inter-sector communication. The beamforming weights are chosen to compromise between maximizing the power to the served user from each sector while minimizing the interference caused to users served in adjacent sectors. The extensions of this method for variable levels of channel state information feedback and multiple receiver antennas are introduced. Beamforming codebooks with power variations across antennas are presented. We show how users can additionally feed back the fraction of interference caused by each interfering sector to incorporate the urgency of interference avoidance into the transmitter optimization.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.81","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621440.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","startPage":"405","endPage":"410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Beamforming Based on Signal-to Caused-Interference Ratio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Beamforming Based on Signal-to Caused-Interference Ratio","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621440/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10207443","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4621440/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Beamforming Based on Signal-to Caused-Interference Ratio","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-16-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104491S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4621446,"authors":[{"name":"Jee-Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jee-Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37407294000"},{"name":"Eu-Suk Shim","affiliation":["Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eu-Suk","lastName":"Shim","id":"37542813200"},{"name":"Hyoung-Kyu Song","affiliation":["Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Kyu","lastName":"Song","id":"37270117500"},{"name":"Young-Hwan You","affiliation":["Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Hwan","lastName":"You","id":"37269122600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621446","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Synchronization","Receivers","Time frequency analysis","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","synchronisation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-less synchronization receiver","UWB-OFDM systems","carrier frequency offset","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","time-variant behavior","time-domain spreaded data samples","mean square error","MSE","bit error rate","BER"]}],"abstract":"Carrier frequency offset (CFO) is one of the most important problems in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which seriously degrades the performance of the systems due to its time-variant behavior.

It is though sensitive to frequency errors that may be caused by several factors such as frequency offset at the local oscillator, phase noise and mobility of the receiver. These errors introduce Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) that may be represented in the frequency domain by means of an ICI matrix. Since these types of errors greatly affect the performance of an OFDM system, estimation of this matrix is crucial. In this work we propose an iterative method that uses pilot tones in the frequency domain and converges very quickly. It works in two steps. In the first, correlation between received signal and estimated transmitted signal is used to estimate the channel matrix, and the second estimates the actual transmitted data by means of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalization. Results, in the case of high frequency offset and of a time varying flat fading channel, show that the proposed method is very effective.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.93","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621452.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","startPage":"470","endPage":"474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Domain Estimation and Compensation of Intercarrier Interference in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Domain Estimation and Compensation of Intercarrier Interference in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621452/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220403","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4621452/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Domain Estimation and Compensation of Intercarrier Interference in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-18-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050672S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":4621453,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Jung Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Chin-Jung","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37693896500"},{"name":"Sau-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Sau-Gee","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277602600"},{"name":"Hsiao-Lan Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Lan","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37690705100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621453","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Fading","Time domain analysis","Bit error rate","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","diversity reception","fading channels","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data detection algorithms","OFDM systems","time-varying multipath fading channels","intercarrier interference","performance degradation","mobile speed","carrier frequency","symbol duration","computational complexity","frequency diversity","zero-forcing detection"]}],"abstract":"For fast-fading time-varying channels, channel variations over an OFDM symbol destroy the orthogonality among subcarriers. The resulting intercarrier interference (ICI) degrades the system performance. The degradation becomes severer as mobile speed, carrier frequency, or symbol duration increase. In this work, based on the existing data detection methods, several modifications are proposed to improve the system performances and to reduce the computational complexity. The proposed methods effectively use frequency diversity provided by time-varying channels. As a result, the proposed techniques noticeably outperform the conventional methods, including the ICI cancellation method and zero-forcing (ZF) detection.

Using theoretical analysis and practical implementation in DSP technology it has been shown that the random sequences generated from the Gaussian distribution can be efficiently used in this CDMA system. In this way the security of the message transmission is enhanced due to the random nature of all signals generated and used for users' message signal spreading and coding in this communication system. The signal processing blocks of the system, including the transmitter, receiver and the channel, are theoretically described. The expressions for the probability of error are derived for the case when the additive white Gaussian noise and fading are present in the channel. The system, including the transceiver and the channel, is implemented in DSP technology and the theoretical results are confirmed by measurements on the designed system. Moreover the acquisition phase of a synchronization block using Gaussian distributed random signals is also theoretically analyzed and implemented in DSP technology.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.104","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621463.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","startPage":"528","endPage":"533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Communication in Asynchronous Noise Phase Shift Keying CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communication in Asynchronous Noise Phase Shift Keying CDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621463/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220412","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4621463/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communication in Asynchronous Noise Phase Shift Keying CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-20-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078175S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621464,"authors":[{"name":"Sujit Jos","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Sujit","lastName":"Jos","id":"37694901200"},{"name":"Preetam Kumar","affiliation":["GSSST, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Preetam","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37382692600"},{"name":"Saswat Chakrabarti","affiliation":["GSSST, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Saswat","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37287172900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621464","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"abstract":"Code division multiple access (CDMA) schemes and combination of CDMA with OFDM have been considered as attractive multiple access schemes in the second-generation (2G), third-generation (3G) and future broadband wireless systems. In this paper, we studied the performance of DS-CDMA signals with quasi-orthogonal codes namely balanced gold codes and m-sequences in presence of timing synchronization error. The synchronization error considered is smaller than the chip duration. We evaluate the maximum synchronization error that can be tolerated so that complete error-free despreading is guaranteed for the two quasi-orthogonal codes in the absence of additive white Gaussian noise and channel impairments. This provides insight in the synchronization demands for QS-CDMA systems. Also system capacity (the total bit rate which can be transmitted) subject to this synchronization error has been calculated for the two codes. It has been found that m-sequence provide maximum tolerable synchronization error and system capacity as compared to balanced gold code. We have also presented the BER analysis for QS-CDMA. The BER performance of the two quasi-orthogonal sequences at different values of synchronization error is also studied. Monte-Carlo simulations have been carried out to verify analysis with the simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621464.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"538","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER Analysis of Quasi-Orthogonal Codes in Quasi-Synchronous CDMA Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Gold","Noise","Mathematical model","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband networks","channel coding","code division multiple access","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER analysis","quasiorthogonal codes","quasisynchronous CDMA communication","code division multiple access","multiple access schemes","3G broadband wireless systems","DS-CDMA signals","balanced gold codes","error synchronization","additive white Gaussian noise","Monte-Carlo simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"BER Analysis of Quasi-Orthogonal Codes in Quasi-Synchronous CDMA Communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621464/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220413","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER Analysis of Quasi-Orthogonal Codes in Quasi-Synchronous CDMA Communication","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-20-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049028S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4621465,"authors":[{"name":"Preetam Kumar","affiliation":["IIT, GSSST, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Preetam","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37382692600"},{"name":"Sujit Jos","affiliation":["Departmentt. of ECE, IIT, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Sujit","lastName":"Jos","id":"37694901200"},{"name":"Saswat Chakrabarti","affiliation":["IIT, GSSST, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Saswat","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37287172900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621465","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"abstract":"Overloading is a technique to accommodate more number of users than the spreading factor N. This is a bandwidth efficient scheme to increase the number users in a fixed bandwidth. One of the efficient schemes to overload a CDMA system is to use two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms (O/O). The first set is assigned to the N users and the second set is assigned to the additional M users. An iterative multistage detection (IMSD) technique is used to cancel interference between the two sets of users. The interference cancellation receiver uses hard decisions (HDIC) or soft decisions (SDIC) to estimate the interference. In this paper, the BER performance of s-O/O overloading scheme using Walsh-Hadamard (WH) orthogonal codes is evaluated with SDIC receiver on a Rayleigh fading channel. It is observed that this scheme provides the channel overloading of 33% at a BER of 0.0005, with an SNR degradation of about 1 dB as compared to single user performance on a Rayleigh fading channel with real scrambling. With complex scrambling, overloading performance increases significantly to 75%. This is a significant amount of overloading on a Rayleigh fading channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621465.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"543","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overloading Performance of OCDMA/OCDMA Scheme for Cellular DS-CDMA System on Rayleigh Fading Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Receivers","Interference cancellation","Interference","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","error statistics","interference suppression","orthogonal codes","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OCDMA/OCDMA scheme","cellular DS-CDMA system","Rayleigh fading channel","channel overloading","orthogonal signal waveforms","iterative multistage detection","interference cancellation receiver","hard decisions","soft decisions","BER performance","Walsh-Hadamard orthogonal codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Overloading Performance of OCDMA/OCDMA Scheme for Cellular DS-CDMA System on Rayleigh Fading Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621465/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220414","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overloading Performance of OCDMA/OCDMA Scheme for Cellular DS-CDMA System on Rayleigh Fading Channel","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-20-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125033S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621466,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["ENST, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405162200"},{"name":"Loic Brunel","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric ITE-TCL, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Loic","lastName":"Brunel","id":"37283177900"},{"name":"Joseph J.

Although based on distinct philosophies, both strategies are well justified in wireless systems with a great variety of deployment conditions and user mobility. The results obtained in this paper show that frequency-adaptive transmission is particularly effective when both subcarrier allocation and adaptive coding and modulation are used.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.111","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621470.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","startPage":"566","endPage":"571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Adaptation Strategies for OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate Adaptation Strategies for OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621470/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10207447","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4621470/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Adaptation Strategies for OFDMA","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-21-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094621S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621472,"authors":[{"name":"Hendrik Schoneich","affiliation":["Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Hendrik","lastName":"Schoneich","id":"37697677400"},{"name":"Armin Dekorsy","affiliation":["Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dekorsy","id":"37284963100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621472","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","radio networks","scheduling","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing","power allocation","IDMA","multihop wireless networks","scheduling","transceiver structure","interleave-division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"Efficiently transmitting data in wireless mesh networks requires an integrated routing, scheduling, and power control strategy.

The proposed estimator is compared to the subset estimator from [1]. Although performing slightly worse than the subset estimator at low SNR, the proposed estimator outperforms the subset estimator at high SNR, as the former does not suffer from an error floor in the MSE. The MSE resulting from the proposed estimator is inversely proportional to the number of pilot carriers and is independent of the FFT size, the pilot carrier positions and the used pilot sequence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Data-Aided Channel Estimation for KSP-OFDM","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.120","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621479.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Data-Aided Channel Estimation for KSP-OFDM","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621479/","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220426","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Domain Data-Aided Channel Estimation for KSP-OFDM","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-24-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058175S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4621481,"authors":[{"name":"Uk Her","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Uk","lastName":"Her","id":"37695552900"},{"name":"Kwang-Soo Jeong","affiliation":["YuJeong Systems Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang-Soo","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37684772400"},{"name":"Jae-Hoon Yi","affiliation":["YuJeong Systems Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Hoon","lastName":"Yi","id":"37693262800"},{"name":"Hyoung-Kyu Song","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Kyu","lastName":"Song","id":"37270117500"},{"name":"Young-Hwan You","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Hwan","lastName":"You","id":"37269122600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621481","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Estimation","Frequency estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Frequency synthesizers","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB multiband OFDM","carrier frequency offset estimator","ultra-wideband multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","frequency domain spreaded data symbol","mean square error","bit error rate","improved residual CFO estimation scheme"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a fine carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator is proposed for ultra-wideband multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UWB MB-OFDM) systems.

We show that the transmitter can be implemented via a concatenation of IDoFTs and a single low rate polyphase filter bank independently of the number of transmit antennas. Further, we propose a multiuser receiver architecture that requires a single polyphase filter bank and a concatenation of DFTs, which allows for a deep complexity reduction. The multiuser receiver is capable of achieving the performance of the bank of synchronous single user receivers. Moreover we prove that the efficient implementation yields a significant reduction of the complexity for both the transmitter and the receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621497.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"713","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation Complexity Analysis of the Concatenated MIMO DMT-FMT Multiuser System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Filter bank","Receivers","Transmitting antennas","Complexity theory","Demodulation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radio receivers","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity analysis","MIMO DMT-FMT multiuser system","uplink transmission","filtered multitone modulator","multiple antennas","space-time cyclically prefixed discrete multitone modulator","transmitter","polyphase filter bank","transmit antenna","multiuser receiver architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Implementation Complexity Analysis of the Concatenated MIMO DMT-FMT Multiuser System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621497/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220441","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation Complexity Analysis of the Concatenated MIMO DMT-FMT Multiuser System","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-27-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044898S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621498,"authors":[{"name":"Abdel-Nasser Assimi","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS,ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Abdel-Nasser","lastName":"Assimi","id":"37391795000"},{"name":"Charly Poulliat","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS,ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poulliat","id":"37269105300"},{"name":"Inbar Fijalkow","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS,ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Inbar","lastName":"Fijalkow","id":"37269104600"},{"name":"David Declercq","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS,ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Declercq","id":"37269103100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621498","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a simple and effective preceding technique to mitigate intersymbol interference in communication systems that implement automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols over slowly time-varying frequency-selective channels.

The novel ordering scheme reduces the complexity of detection process imposed by the need for a thorough search among all possible combinations of substreams (groups) in each stage of detection, in order to find the best substream (group) which has the highest post-detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detection in that stage.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621499.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"724","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Novel Ordering for Group Maximum Likelihood Detection in MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Complexity theory","Gain","Maximum likelihood detection","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fading channels","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-complexity","group maximum likelihood detection","MIMO frequency selective fading channels","multiinput multioutput channel","time-varying frequency selective fading channel","detection-cancellation scheme","layered maximum likelihood detection","ordering scheme","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Novel Ordering for Group Maximum Likelihood Detection in MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621499/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10207452","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Novel Ordering for Group Maximum Likelihood Detection in MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-27-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041286S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621502,"authors":[{"name":"Frederik Vanhaverbeke","affiliation":["TELIN/DIGCOM, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Frederik","lastName":"Vanhaverbeke","id":"37269246600"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["TELIN/DIGCOM, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37269902700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2204-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"}],"articleNumber":"4621502","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Interference","Multiaccess communication","Delay","Signal to noise ratio","Downlink","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","synchronisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversaturated CDMA channels","code division multiple access","signatures sequences","spreading factor","turbo detection","nonscalable sequence sets","synchronous CDMA systems","maximum acceptable system load","downlink user capacity","synchronized sequences"]}],"abstract":"The paper gives an overview of several types of signatures sequences for communication in CDMA systems with more users than the spreading factor.

We focus here on a 2D OCDMA system using 2D multi-weight codes and parallel mapping technique to provide respectively quality of service (QoS) and data rate differentiation. To improve the performance of such a scheme, we investigate forward error correction (FEC) based on low density parity check (LDPC) codes known to have an efficient error correction power for Gaussian channels. We particularly propose an adaptation of the LDPC decoding scheme to the 2D OCDMA multimedia channel which has a specific noise distribution due to multiple access interference (MAI). We evaluate the system robustness to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) perturbation in addition to MAI and the gain provided in term of SNR. Finally, we show that the adapted FEC scheme we propose, not only permits improving the data rate per service but also the number of simultaneously communicating users.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.151","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621358/4621359/04621510.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapted LDPC Error Correction Scheme for 2D Optical CDMA Multimedia System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621510/","displayDocTitle":"Adapted LDPC Error Correction Scheme for 2D Optical CDMA Multimedia System","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621510/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220449","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapted LDPC Error Correction Scheme for 2D Optical CDMA Multimedia System","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"A-30-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072511S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621358","isNumber":"4621359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4621359","articleId":"4621510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4621512,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Lentmaier","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lentmaier","id":"37283339900"},{"name":"Gerhard P.

By monitoring soil, crop and climate in a field and providing a decision support system that is able to learn, it is possible to deliver treatments, such as irrigation, fertilizer and pesticide application, for specific parts of a field in real time and proactively. In this context, we have applied machine learning techniques to automatically extract new knowledge in the form of generalized decision rules towards the best administration of natural resources like water. The machine learning application model suggested in this paper is based on an inductive and iterative process of discovering knowledge on the basis of which, patterns and associations having arisen initially are re-examined to expand the pre-existing knowledge. The result of this study was the creation of an effective set of decision rules used to predict the plants' state and the prevention of unpleasant impacts from the water stress in plants.","doi":"10.1109/PCI.2008.30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCI.2008.30","startPage":"100","endPage":"104","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4621519/4621520/04621545.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Machine Learning to Extract New Knowledge in Precision Agriculture Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Applying Machine Learning to Extract New Knowledge in Precision Agriculture Applications","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621545/","accessionNumber":"10220469","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621545/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Machine Learning to Extract New Knowledge in Precision Agriculture Applications","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"3323a100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060413S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4621519","isNumber":"4621520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4621519","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4621520","articleId":"4621545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4621622,"authors":[{"name":"Katarzyna Jagodzinska","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Koszalin University of Technology, Poland"],"firstName":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Jagodzinska","id":"37697100600"},{"name":"Marcin Wysota","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Koszalin University of Technology, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Wysota","id":"37697074400"},{"name":"Maciej Walkowiak","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Koszalin University of Technology, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Walkowiak","id":"37697074200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2244-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2245-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4621622","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4621622","abstract":"In this article we report on the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) in the design of electrically small linear antennas, taking into consideration the lowest VSWR and the best antenna gain. For the antenna configuration, we employ a multisegment wire structure. Our antenna structures resemble a monopole over the perfectly conducting ground plane. The arm of the monopole is the set of a fixed number of connected linear wire segments. All segments are the same length. Each segment of the antenna is bounded by a hemispheric space with a given radius. The total length of a monopole is constant. To achieve efficient set of designs, trading off VSWR and gain we use GA in conjunction with algorithm which creates initial population of antennas. In our GA each wire shape is encoded into a chromosome. The total size of chromosome depends on number of wire segments. After operation of reproduction, crossover and mutation several antennas structures are generated. To predict the performance of generated antennas we use the numerical electromagnetics code.","doi":"10.1109/INFTECH.2008.4621622","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 1st International Conference on Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609442/4621577/04621622.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 1st International Conference on Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFTECH.2008.4621622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrically small linear antennas generated with a genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Gallium","Biological cells","Wire","Gain","Genetic algorithms","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","linear antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","electrically small linear antennas design","multisegment wire structure","chromosome","numerical electromagnetics code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electrically small linear antennas generated with a genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4621622/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10220235","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrically small linear antennas generated with a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"0603_it2008_format_pdf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04283S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4609442","isNumber":"4621577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4609442","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4621577","articleId":"4621622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4621663,"authors":[{"name":"Marek Wojcikowski","affiliation":["Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Wojcikowski","id":"37541047100"},{"name":"Robert Zaglewski","affiliation":["Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Zaglewski","id":"37087719061"},{"name":"Bogdan Pankiewicz","affiliation":["Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Pankiewicz","id":"37327256600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2244-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2245-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4621663","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Cameras","Hardware","Vehicles","Estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image motion analysis","image sensors","intelligent sensors","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent image processing sensor","moving vehicle extraction","real-time camera image","traffic parameter","monochrome camera","pipelined hardware","FPGA","frame-rate efficiency"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the idea and the implementation of the robust algorithm dedicated to extraction of moving vehicles from real-time camera images for the evaluation of traffic parameters, such as the number of vehicles, their direction of movement and their approximate speed.

Moreover, encoding schemes based on beta-complementary sequences provide very good tradeoff performance between PMEPR and code rate.

Furthermore, the distribution of code rate versus beta is determined, and numerical results based on these properties are presented.

They are the conventional perfect electric conductor (PEC), the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), and their combination. A half-wavelength dipole in free space is considered as the reference case, and its performance over these ground planes is investigated and compared. It is shown that by using a combined PMC-PEC ground plane, one can achieve a better performance. Next, a microstrip patch antenna is considered as the source and is placed over a high-impedance surface (HIS) or an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC). Here too, adding a PEC ground plane on the periphery of the HIS or AMC improves the antenna gain significantly. As well, the superiority of AMC ground planes, consisting of grounded dielectric slabs loaded with periodic metallic patches without shorting pins (vias), is investigated in detail. Simulation results show that use of such artificial ground planes can enhance the microstrip patch antenna gain and bandwidth remarkably. These enhancements are confirmed by measurement, and high gains of 10.4 dBi and input impedance bandwidths of 28% are measured.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2008.4621833","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/4621829/04621833.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2008.4621833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4621829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of combined electric- and magnetic-conductor ground planes for antenna performance enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4621833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring  2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of combined electric- and magnetic-conductor ground planes for antenna performance enhancement","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Spring 2008","accessionNumber":"10207768","htmlLink":"/document/4621833/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of combined electric- and magnetic-conductor ground planes for antenna performance enhancement","sourcePdf":"1100-foroozesh-FINAL.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083226S","chronDate":"Spring  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"4621829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4621829","articleId":"4621833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4622345,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Preradovic","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Stevan","lastName":"Preradovic","id":"37298748900"},{"name":"Nemai C.

The conditions existing within high voltage power transformers (ac voltage, moderately divergent electric field, presence of insulating solids, particles in the oil, etc.) are rather different from those frequently used in the laboratory to study streamers (very divergent field -point-plane geometry-, and impulse voltage). Parameters such as field geometry, voltage waveform, liquid conditioning, can influence either streamer inception or propagation. After a short presentation of streamer phenomena in liquids, the most important effects of these parameters are recalled in this paper. Many features previously observed empirically by the measurement of breakdown voltage can be explained by the behaviour of streamers in conditions close to those actually present in transformers. It remains rather difficult today to model and predict streamer properties (initiation fields, propagation length, velocity, ...) when the liquid nature is changed. The large variety of physical processes involved during initiation and propagation, and the non-linearity of many processes make the study of breakdown in liquids complex. However, knowledge about streamers is helpful to define and measure parameters of practical importance (initiation and propagation conditions), providing a more scientific basis to test and compare the properties of liquids.","doi":"10.1109/ICDL.2008.4622543","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Dielectric Liquids","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Dielectric Liquids","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610658/4622446/04622543.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDL.2008.4622543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u201cStreamers\u201d in liquids: Relation with practical high voltage insulation and testing of liquids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622543/","displayDocTitle":"\u201cStreamers\u201d in liquids: Relation with practical high voltage insulation and testing of liquids","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10204851","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4622543/","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u201cStreamers\u201d in liquids: Relation with practical high voltage insulation and testing of liquids","confLoc":"Chasseneuil, France","sourcePdf":"PID660566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053275S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610658","isNumber":"4622446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610658","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4622446","articleId":"4622543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4622576,"authors":[{"name":"Yuka Ikebe","affiliation":["Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuka","lastName":"Ikebe","id":"37087166304"},{"name":"Takehiro Nakayama","affiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Takehiro","lastName":"Nakayama","id":"37087169058"},{"name":"Masaji Katagiri","affiliation":["NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Japan"],"firstName":"Masaji","lastName":"Katagiri","id":"37693196000"},{"name":"Satoshi Kawasaki","affiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Kawasaki","id":"37700959300"},{"name":"Hirotake Abe","affiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotake","lastName":"Abe","id":"37395433900"},{"name":"Takahiro Shinagawa","affiliation":["NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Shinagawa","id":"37701122200"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Kato","affiliation":["NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Kato","id":"37086225736"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3329-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2108"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2116"}],"articleNumber":"4622576","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Mobile handsets","Training","Accuracy","Computer architecture","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer viruses","mobile computing","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection system","mobile handsets","software behavior","ARM architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection system","antivirus","software behavior"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622576","doi":"10.1109/SECURWARE.2008.16","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies","abstract":"A new anomaly detection system for mobile handsets has been proposed.

In order to resolve this problem, the proposed system assesses the anomalousness of behavior not covered by the model. Moreover, this system needs to have a low overhead in order to be used in mobile handsets, which have less computational resource than a PC.

As part of this effort, this paper presents an event-driven and multi-layer architecture based on the concept of pattern and where concepts such as similarity and credibility degrees are presented as part of a probabilistic approach for dealing with possible variations of a given attack.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622612","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622544/4622545/04622612.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECURWARE.2008.49","startPage":"391","endPage":"396","doi":"10.1109/SECURWARE.2008.49","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Event-Driven Architecture for Intrusion Detection Systems Based on Patterns","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4622612/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10205047","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Driven Architecture for Intrusion Detection Systems Based on Patterns","confLoc":"Cap Esterel, France","sourcePdf":"3329a391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069436S","chronDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622544","isNumber":"4622545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622544","xplore-issue":"4622545","articleId":"4622612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4622659,"authors":[{"name":"Nader Mohamed","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37305018000"},{"name":"Imad Jawhar","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Imad","lastName":"Jawhar","id":"37316378600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3330-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4622659","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":732},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622659","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Wireless sensor networks","Monitoring","Wireless communication","Reliability","Wireless networks","Wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","fault tolerance","pipelines","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant wired sensor network","fault tolerant wireless sensor network","pipeline infrastructures monitoring","primary networks","pipelines monitoring-and-control","network cables disconnection","power management","integrated network architecture","oil pipelines","water pipelines","gas pipelines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pipelines Protection and Monitoring","Sensor Networks","Wired/Wireless Networks","Fault-Tolerant Networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2008.116","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications (sensorcomm 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications (sensorcomm 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622620/4622621/04622659.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2008.116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fault Tolerant Wired/Wireless Sensor Network Architecture for Monitoring Pipeline Infrastructures","abstract":"This paper proposes a new fault-tolerant sensor network architecture for monitoring pipeline infrastructures. This architecture is an integrated wired and wireless network. The wired part of the network is considered the primary network while the wireless part is used as a backup among sensor nodes when there is any failure in the wired network. This architecture solves the current reliability issues of wired networks for pipelines monitoring and control. This includes the problem of disabling the network by disconnecting the network cables due to artificial or natural reasons. In addition, it solves the issues raised in recently proposed network architectures using wireless sensor networks for pipeline monitoring. These issues include the issues of power management and efficient routing for wireless sensor nodes to extend the life of the network. Detailed advantages of the proposed integrated network architecture are discussed under different application and fault scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622659/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10205077","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4622659/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Fault Tolerant Wired/Wireless Sensor Network Architecture for Monitoring Pipeline Infrastructures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fault Tolerant Wired/Wireless Sensor Network Architecture for Monitoring Pipeline Infrastructures","confLoc":"Cap Esterel, France","sourcePdf":"3330a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035472S","chronDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622620","isNumber":"4622621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622620","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4622621","articleId":"4622659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4622682,"authors":[{"name":"Pawel Piotr Czapski","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, School of Computer Engineering, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pawel Piotr","lastName":"Czapski","id":"37294137900"},{"name":"Andrzej Sluzek","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, School of Computer Engineering, Singapore"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Sluzek","id":"37296791200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3330-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4622682","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"abstract":"With growth demands to untethered embedded systems, e.g. sensor nodes, in the flexibility, performance, product longevity, areas, and decreasing time-to-market (TTM), programmable logic devices may allow covering lack of suitable processing units. Decrease in the feature transistor sizes allows producing smaller programmable devices and providing more computational power. However, such shrinking of feature sizes introduces higher power lost (static power). Moreover, programmable devices are clocked with higher frequencies due to the performance demands increase that introduces additional power consumption. Therefore, there is a need for techniques that allow for substantial power reduction and being achievable on the higher levels of the designing process. In this paper, we address means of the dynamic power consumption reduction on the system-level. This is envisaged that proposed techniques may allow achieving substantial power consumption savings with negligible hardware overheads while maintaining the energy per operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications (sensorcomm 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622620/4622621/04622682.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"328","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications (sensorcomm 2008)","doi":"10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2008.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2008.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on System-Level Techniques for Power Reduction in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Power demand","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensors","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level techniques","power reduction","field programmable gate array-based devices","untethered embedded systems","sensor nodes","product longevity","time-to-market","programmable logic devices","dynamic power consumption reduction","power consumption savings","negligible hardware overheads"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["embedded system","fpga","handel-c","power consumption reduction","sensor node","system-level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on System-Level Techniques for Power Reduction in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4622682/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10205094","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on System-Level Techniques for Power Reduction in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Devices","confLoc":"Cap Esterel, France","sourcePdf":"3330a319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08233S","chronDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622620","isNumber":"4622621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622620","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4622621","articleId":"4622682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4622694,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, we apply genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the problem. In our method, we improve the performance of genetic search by selecting proper initial population. This initial population is determined in two ways, by using Primepsilas algorithm, and shortest path tree. The main issue is to regard nodes individually, and predict their behavior in global optimum. We use Node-Based genetic algorithm for building the communication tree to improve the encoding and decoding process, locality and heritability versus typical GAs.","doi":"10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2008.19","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622620/4622621/04622699.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"434","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications (sensorcomm 2008)","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications (sensorcomm 2008)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2008.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding Aggregation Tree with Genetic Algorithm for Network Correlated Data Gathering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Finding Aggregation Tree with Genetic Algorithm for Network Correlated Data Gathering","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10205106","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4622699/","conferenceDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding Aggregation Tree with Genetic Algorithm for Network Correlated Data Gathering","confLoc":"Cap Esterel, France","sourcePdf":"3330a429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072885S","chronDate":"25-31 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622620","isNumber":"4622621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622620","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4622621","articleId":"4622699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4622799,"authors":[{"name":"Choongyong Shin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Choongyong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37691638000"},{"name":"Seokhoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokhoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37069753000"},{"name":"Jinsung Cho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinsung","lastName":"Cho","id":"37419719200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3328-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4622799","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Wireless LAN","Wireless networks","Mobile computing","Delay","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband networks","code division multiple access","internetworking","mobility management (mobile radio)","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-latency L2 handoff","WiBro mobile network","cdma2000 mobile network","flexible mobility service","interworking mechanism","3G network","WLAN","next generation wireless network","IEEE 802.16e","seamless service","heterogeneous wireless network"]}],"abstract":"As heterogeneous wireless networks are deployed and users need more flexible mobility services, there has been a lot of research work about interworking mechanism between widely deployed 3G network and rapidly boarded WLAN. On the other side, WiBro is newly commercialized in Korea as the next generation wireless network. WiBro is based on IEEE 802.16e and it is expected to provide enough mobility and higher data rate. So the study of the integration between WiBro and cdma 2000 will give better results compared with the existing work of the integration between WLAN and cdma 2000. In order to provide the seamless service across heterogeneous wireless networks, an efficient handoff procedure is essentially required. In this paper, we propose an efficient L2 handoff scheme between cdma 2000 and WiBro networks. The proposed L2 handoff scheme takes an advantage over the existing L3 handoff scheme because it does not require the L3 procedure for the mobility. Through extensive computer simulations with OPNET, the efficiency of the proposed scheme has been validated.","doi":"10.1109/ICHIT.2008.272","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622780/4622781/04622799.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHIT.2008.272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Latency L2 Handoff between WiBro and cdma2000 Mobile Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622799/","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Latency L2 Handoff between WiBro and cdma2000 Mobile Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10187235","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4622799/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Latency L2 Handoff between WiBro and cdma2000 Mobile Networks","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3328a049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040657S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622780","isNumber":"4622781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622780","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4622781","articleId":"4622799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4622849,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yuchi","affiliation":["School of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yuchi","id":"37276374100"},{"name":"Jun Jo","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Griffith University, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Jo","id":"37411450000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3328-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4622849","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622849","abstract":"The technique of combining heart rate (HR) and physical activity (PA) has been adopted in a number of research areas, such as energy expenditure measurement, autonomic nervous system assessment, sports research, etc. However, there have been few studies on the direct relationship between HR and PA.

The predictor has the potential to be used in various areas, such as: cardiopathy research and diagnosis, heart attack warning indicator, sports capability measure and mental activity evaluation. The method has the following steps: first, the recorded HR and PA signals are preprocessed as two synchronized time sequences: HR(n) and PA(n). The inputs of the predictor are HR(n) and PA(n) in the current time step, and the output is the predicted sequence HR(n + 1) in the next time step. The feed forward neural network (FFNN) was chosen as the mathematical model of the predictor. Experiments was conducted based on the real-life signals from a healthy male. A set of 90 minute signals were collected. One half of the signal set was used to train the FFNN and the other half to validate the training. The mean absolute error of the predicted heart rate was restricted inside 5. The result shows the potential of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICHIT.2008.175","startPage":"344","endPage":"350","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622780/4622781/04622849.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHIT.2008.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heart Rate Prediction Based on Physical Activity Using Feedforwad Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart rate","Monitoring","Biomedical monitoring","Acceleration","Artificial neural networks","Training","Electrocardiography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","cardiology","feedforward neural nets","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heart rate prediction","physical activity","feedforwad neural network","cardiopathy research","cardiopathy diagnosis","heart attack warning indicator","sports capability measure","mental activity evaluation","mathematical model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heart rate prediction","physical activity","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Heart Rate Prediction Based on Physical Activity Using Feedforwad Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4622849/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10187263","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heart Rate Prediction Based on Physical Activity Using Feedforwad Neural Network","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3328a344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060863S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622780","isNumber":"4622781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622780","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4622781","articleId":"4622849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4622852,"authors":[{"name":"Haeseong Jeong","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Haeseong","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37692988300"},{"name":"Jong Tae Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Tae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293471200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3328-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4622852","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":446},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Digital video broadcasting","Modulation","Sparse matrices","Channel coding","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","digital video broadcasting","forward error correction","hardware description languages","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC decoder","DVB-S2","min-sum algorithm","digital video broadcasting","digital broadcasting standard","low density parity check","communication speed","VHDL","forward error correction"]}],"abstract":"A new market on digital broadcasting is opening because of the adoption of digital video broadcasting second generation as a digital broadcasting standard in Europe.

The simulated and implemented LDPC decoder is based on the min-sum algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICHIT.2008.193","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622780/4622781/04622852.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHIT.2008.193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of LDPC Decoder in DVB-S2 Using Min-Sum Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622852/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of LDPC Decoder in DVB-S2 Using Min-Sum Algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10187265","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4622852/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of LDPC Decoder in DVB-S2 Using Min-Sum Algorithm","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3328a359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030475S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622780","isNumber":"4622781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622780","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4622781","articleId":"4622852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4622868,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Yun Lim","affiliation":["Security Research Centre, British Telecommunications Public Limited Company, Ipswich, UK"],"firstName":"Shu Yun","lastName":"Lim","id":"37087563667"},{"name":"Andy Jones","affiliation":["Malaysia Research Centre, British Telecommunications Public Limited Company, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Jones","id":"37087558080"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3328-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4622868","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1087},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Artificial neural networks","Security","Monitoring","Intrusion detection","Data mining","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","security of data","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","network behaviour analysis","security solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","network behaviour analysis","network intrusion detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a taxonomy of anomaly detection techniques that is then used to survey and classify a number of research prototypes and commercial products.

However, if the number of iterations and the interleaver size are increased, it is required much delay and computation for an iterative decoding. And it is caused the flattening effect phenomenon which is very little BER performance improvement at the arbitrary SNR. This paper proposes the new asymmetric turbo codes, which is consisted of the parallel concatenated turbo codes, that uses the mixed types of the component codes with different not only the constraint length but also the generator polynomial. It analyzes the BER performance for the log-MAP decoding algorithm with the frame sizes of 128, 256, 512 and 1024 bits, and the coding rate of 1/3. The simulation result shows that the BER performance of the proposal asymmetric turbo codes is superior to the conventional symmetric turbo codes. It can be also observed that the flattening effect phenomenon is very reduced by applying the proposal asymmetric turbo codes.","doi":"10.1109/ICHIT.2008.294","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622780/4622781/04622903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHIT.2008.294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622781","startPage":"667","endPage":"671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Performance Evaluation of the Asymmetric Turbo Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Study on Performance Evaluation of the Asymmetric Turbo Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4622903/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10205203","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4622903/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on Performance Evaluation of the Asymmetric Turbo Codes","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3328a667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059612S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622780","isNumber":"4622781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622780","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4622781","articleId":"4622903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4622929,"authors":[{"name":"Sehwan Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Hongik University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sehwan","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37693709100"},{"name":"Jinsuk Kang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinsuk","lastName":"Kang","id":"37288718400"},{"name":"Jangho Lee","affiliation":["College of Software Engineering, University of Advancing Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Jangho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37696308800"},{"name":"Taikyeong Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Myongji University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taikyeong","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37285927700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3328-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4622929","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Biological neural networks","Brightness","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","variable stars"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable star delta Cephei","backpropagation neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Variable star","BPNN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4622929","abstract":"We investigated that the brightness magnitude of the Del Cephei had been adapted to three different training values and each training had four different hidden layers in the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models.

First, the genetic algorithm was tested theoretically. The Response of MTSM sensor loaded with a model biological system was simulated by using MTSM transmission line model (TLM) representation. Specifically, maximum amplitude and resonant frequency values at the fundamental and odd harmonics (up to 9\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n harmonic) were calculated. These values then were entered into the genetic algorithm (GA) to extract the properties of the model biological systems. The algorithm was tested with single and multiple layers and was able to provide mechanical and geometrical properties of each layer (up to three layers) with an error of less than 5 percent. Next, the GA algorithm was positively tested with experimental data obtained for multi-layer layer structure of Newtonian fluids. Preliminary results showed that genetic algorithm could accurately extract the properties of real biological layered media. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach, which combines a MTSM sensor and genetic algorithm, could fill the gap in quantification and interpretation of measured multi-layer interfacial processes and provide a comprehensive experimental and modeling foundation, which could lead to the development of quantitative tool for the characterization of a broad range of biological interfacial processes.","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.2008.4623057","pdfPath":"/iel5/4620133/4622935/04623057.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"543","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.2008.4623057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of material parameters from a multilayer multi-harmonic thickness shear mode (MTSM) sensor data using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of material parameters from a multilayer multi-harmonic thickness shear mode (MTSM) sensor data using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10204939","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623057/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of material parameters from a multilayer multi-harmonic thickness shear mode (MTSM) sensor data using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"112_3215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059361S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4620133","isNumber":"4622935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4620133","xplore-issue":"4622935","articleId":"4623057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4623068,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Wang","affiliation":["Piezoelectric Device Laboratory, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Ji Wang","id":"37292899200"},{"name":"Wenke Hu","affiliation":["Piezoelectric Device Laboratory, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Wenke Hu","id":"37690462700"},{"name":"Wenhua Zhao","affiliation":["Vectron (Shanghai), Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wenhua Zhao","id":"37421516100"},{"name":"Jianke Du","affiliation":["Piezoelectric Device Laboratory, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Jianke Du","id":"37286784400"},{"name":"Dejin Huang","affiliation":["Piezoelectric Device Laboratory, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Dejin Huang","id":"37401458400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1794-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1795-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-1914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-1949"}],"articleNumber":"4623068","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Crystals","Vibrations","Equations","Resonant frequency","Software","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crystal resonators","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","electrical engineering computing","finite element analysis","Linux","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quartz crystal resonators","Mindlin plate theory","parallel finite element method","Linux cluster","quartz crystal resonator engineers","thickness-shear mode","linear system","frequency spectra","academic researchers","prototyping process","eigenvalue solvers","sparse matrix handling algorithms","parallel computing capability","frequency control industry","supercomputing"]}],"abstract":"Finite element method has been applied to quartz crystal resonator engineers due to its long history in research based on Mindlin plate and three-dimensional approaches for piezoelectric plates with considerations of complication factors such as electrodes, thermal effect, mounting, and packaging, among others. The earlier efforts have been dampened, however, by the fact that the high vibration frequency in the thickness-shear mode has caused significant increase of the problem size in terms of number of equations, or total degree of freedom, in the linear system resulted. It is typical that an accurate analysis of quartz crystal resonator vibrating at the fundamental thickness-shear mode may require solving a linear system around one million for both free and forced vibrations. What we can get from the analysis are the frequency spectra, which are the relationship between frequencies and geometry, and mode shapes of the resonator structure with mountings. This, not surprisingly, is beyond the computing capabilities for many industrial engineers who do not have access to resources like supercomputers widely available to academic researchers. On the other hand, the finite element method is an excellent tool for crystal resonator analysis we should utilize for quick and precise prototyping process. In order to overcome the challenge of computing power, the finite element program development has been taking steps through employing Mindlin plate theory, efficient eigenvalue solvers, and sparse matrix handling algorithms, as ways to aggressively improve the efficiency and reduce stringent requirements on hardware. In this continuing research, we have replaced our earlier version of the finite element program with ARPACK as the eigenvalue solver, added sparse matrix handling functions, and implemented parallel computing capability on a cost-effective Linux cluster. The computing capability has been improved with the utilization of multiple processors significantly while the cost of infrastructure and operations is within the reach of the frequency control industry. We shall introduce the core improvements on algorithms, parallel features and implementation, hardware requirements, and computing power gain based on our current program configuration. The program has been developed in partnership with major industry players to demonstrate the effectiveness of supercomputing and finite element method as an important design tool for resonator design and improvement.","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.2008.4623068","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4620133/4622935/04623068.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.2008.4623068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of quartz crystal resonators with mindlin plate theory based parallel finite element method on a Linux cluster","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623068/","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of quartz crystal resonators with mindlin plate theory based parallel finite element method on a Linux cluster","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10204949","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623068/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of quartz crystal resonators with mindlin plate theory based parallel finite element method on a Linux cluster","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"123_3174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04766S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4620133","isNumber":"4622935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4620133","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4622935","articleId":"4623068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4623081,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan T.

As the name suggests, FR3 builds upon the RIPPER algorithm, a state-of-the-art rule learner. More specifically, in the context of polychotomous classification, it uses a fuzzy extension of RIPPER as a base learner within a round robin scheme, and thus, can be seen as a fuzzy variant of the R3 learner that has recently been introduced in the literature. A key feature of FR3, in comparison with its nonfuzzy counterpart, is its ability to represent different facets of uncertainty involved in a classification decision in a more faithful way. FR3 thus provides the basis for implementing \u201creliable classifiers\u201d that may abstain from a decision when not being sure enough, or at least indicate that a classification is not fully supported by the empirical evidence at hand. Besides, our experimental results show that FR3 outperforms R3 in terms of classification accuracy, and therefore, suggest that it produces predictions that are not only more reliable but also more accurate. The superb classification performance of FR3 is furthermore confirmed by comparing it to other state-of-the-art (fuzzy) rule learners. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.2005490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.2005490","startPage":"138","endPage":"149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4773438/04623131.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FR3: A Fuzzy Rule Learner for Inducing Reliable Classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"FR3: A Fuzzy Rule Learner for Inducing Reliable Classifiers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623131/","accessionNumber":"10470313","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623131/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FR3: A Fuzzy Rule Learner for Inducing Reliable Classifiers","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-hllermeier-2005490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172988S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4773438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4773438","articleId":"4623131","onlineDate":"09 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":4623133,"authors":[{"name":"William C.

Using past traffic traces we characterize network traffic during various time-of-day intervals, assuming that it is anomaly-free. We present two different approaches to characterize traffic: (i) a model-free approach based on the method of types and Sanov's theorem, and (ii) a model-based approach modeling traffic using a Markov modulated process. Using these characterizations as a reference we continuously monitor traffic and employ large deviations and decision theory results to ldquocomparerdquo the empirical measure of the monitored traffic with the corresponding reference characterization, thus, identifying traffic anomalies in real-time. Our experimental results show that applying our methodology (even short-lived) anomalies are identified within a small number of observations. Throughout, we compare the two approaches presenting their advantages and disadvantages to identify and classify temporal network anomalies. We also demonstrate how our framework can be used to monitor traffic from multiple network elements in order to identify both spatial and temporal anomalies.

Specifically, each agent is assigned a control law, which is the sum of two elements: a repulsive potential field, which is responsible for the collision avoidance objective, and an attractive potential field, which forces the agents to converge to a configuration where they are close to each other. Furthermore, the attractive potential field forces the agents that are initially located within the sensing radius of an agent to remain within this area for all time. In this way, the connectivity properties of the initially formed communication graph are rendered invariant for the trajectories of the closed-loop system. It is shown that under the proposed control law, agents converge to a configuration where each agent is located at a bounded distance from each of its neighbors. The results are also extended to the case of nonholonomic kinematic unicycle-type agents and to the case of dynamic edge addition. In the latter case, we derive a smaller bound in the swarm size than in the static case.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.2002313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4663225/04623138.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.2002313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","startPage":"1213","endPage":"1223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectedness Preserving Distributed Swarm Aggregation for Multiple Kinematic Robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Connectedness Preserving Distributed Swarm Aggregation for Multiple Kinematic Robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623138/","volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4623138/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301450","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectedness Preserving Distributed Swarm Aggregation for Multiple Kinematic Robots","sourcePdf":"tro-dimarognas-2002313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079607S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4663225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"4663225","articleId":"4623138","onlineDate":"09 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4623139,"authors":[{"name":"Eiichi Yoshida","affiliation":["AIST/IS-CNRS/ST2I Joint French-Japanese Robotics Laboratory (JRL), National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4663225/4623139/4623139-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eiichi Yoshida (S'94--M'96) received the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees on precision machinery engineering from the Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1993 and 1996, respectively.","In 1996, he joined former Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan.

The framework consists of two stages that are applied iteratively. In the first stage, a collision-free path is obtained through efficient geometric and kinematic sampling-based motion planning. In the second stage, the path is transformed into dynamically executable robot trajectories by dedicated dynamic motion generators. In the proposed iterative method, those dynamic trajectories are sent back again to the first stage to check for collisions. Depending on the application, temporal or spatial reshaping methods are used to treat detected collisions. Temporal reshaping adjusts the velocity, whereas spatial reshaping deforms the path itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through examples of a space manipulator with highly nonlinear dynamics and a humanoid robot executing dynamic manipulation and locomotion at the same time.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.2002312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4663225/04623139.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.2002312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663225","startPage":"1186","endPage":"1198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning 3-D Collision-Free Dynamic Robotic Motion Through Iterative Reshaping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Planning 3-D Collision-Free Dynamic Robotic Motion Through Iterative Reshaping","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10291073","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623139/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning 3-D Collision-Free Dynamic Robotic Motion Through Iterative Reshaping","sourcePdf":"tro-yoshida-2002312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089912S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4663225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4663225","articleId":"4623139","onlineDate":"09 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4623142,"authors":[{"name":"V.

When the input to the filter is a balanced three-phase set of signals, the filter suppresses noise and distortions and extracts a smooth three-phase fundamental component. When the input signal to the filter is unbalanced, it extracts the fundamental positive-sequence component of the input signal. The filter also estimates the magnitude, phase angle, and frequency of the signal and adaptively follows the variations in all these three variables. The characteristics of the filter, including its mathematical equations, stability analysis, steady state, and dynamic responses, are discussed in this paper. The filter highly attenuates the harmonics, unknown interharmonics, and distortions. However, an extension of the filter for full removal of harmonics and unknown interharmonics is also presented, and its operating principles are discussed. The structural simplicity and robustness of the filter make it desirable for power system applications. In addition to the wide applications in power systems, it can specifically be used as an adaptive antialiasing filter for three-phase applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2008.2003331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4740169/04623143.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2008.2003331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Filtering Technique for Three-Phase Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623143/","displayDocTitle":"A Filtering Technique for Three-Phase Power Systems","volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10390687","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623143/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Filtering Technique for Three-Phase Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tim-karimighartemani-2003331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081178S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4740169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4740169","articleId":"4623143","onlineDate":"09 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4623152,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed algorithm aims at maximizing system throughput while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements of the RT and BE services. We take two kinds of QoS requirements into account. One is the required average transmission rate for both RT and BE services. The other is the tolerable average absolute deviation of transmission rate (AADTR) just for the RT services, which is used to control the fluctuation in transmission rates and to limit the RT packet delay to a moderate level. We formulate the optimization problem representing the resource allocation under consideration and solve it by using the dual optimization technique and the projection stochastic subgradient method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm well meets the QoS requirements with the high throughput and outperforms the modified largest weighted delay first (M-LWDF) algorithm that supports similar QoS requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation in OFDMA Wireless Communications Systems Supporting Multimedia Services","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2008.2001470","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5075918/04623156.pdf","startPage":"926","endPage":"935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2008.2001470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in OFDMA Wireless Communications Systems Supporting Multimedia Services","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4623156/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10704991","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in OFDMA Wireless Communications Systems Supporting Multimedia Services","sourcePdf":"tnet-jeon-2001470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081193S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5075918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5075918","articleId":"4623156","onlineDate":"09 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4623175,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Foi","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4623174/4623175/4623175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Foi received the M.

Owing to the growing ubiquity of color imaging and display devices, much recent work has focused on the implications of such arrays for subsequent digital processing, including in particular the canonical \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">demosaicking</i>\n task of reconstructing a full color image from spatially subsampled and incomplete color data acquired under a particular choice of array pattern. In contrast to the majority of the demosaicking literature, we consider here the problem of color filter array \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">design</i>\n and its implications for spatial reconstruction quality. We pose this problem formally as one of simultaneously maximizing the spectral radii of luminance and chrominance channels subject to perfect reconstruction, and - after proving sub-optimality of a wide class of existing array patterns - provide a constructive method for its solution that yields robust, new panchromatic designs implementable as subtractive colors. Empirical evaluations on multiple color image test sets support our theoretical results, and indicate the potential of these patterns to increase spatial resolution for fixed sensor size, and to contribute to improved reconstruction fidelity as well as significantly reduced hardware complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4623174/04623180.pdf","startPage":"1876","endPage":"1890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2002164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2002164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-Spectral Color Filter Array Design for Optimal Image Recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Image reconstruction","Digital images","Digital filters","Pixel","Displays","Robustness","Testing","Spatial resolution","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image reconstruction","image sampling","optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatio spectral color filter array","optimal image recovery","digital imaging applications","display devices","canonical demosaicking task","spatial reconstruction quality","luminance channels","chrominance channels","panchromatic designs","subtractive colors","spatial subsampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color filter array (CFA)","color imaging","demosaicking","digital camera pipeline","spatio-spectral sampling"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Color","Colorimetry","Colorimetry","Computer Graphics","Computer-Aided Design","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Image Enhancement","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spatio-Spectral Color Filter Array Design for Optimal Image Recovery","volume":"17","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4623180/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185932","pubMedId":"18784035","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatio-Spectral Color Filter Array Design for Optimal Image Recovery","sourcePdf":"17tip10-khirakawa-2002164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115334S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4623174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4623174","articleId":"4623180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4623181,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald R.

First, a comparative study of a newly developed dynamical multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEA) and some modern algorithms, such as the indicator-based evolutionary algorithm, multiple single objective Pareto sampling, and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, is presented by employing the convergence metric and relative hypervolume metric. For three scalable test problems (namely, DTLZ1, DTLZ2, and DTLZ6), which represent some of the most difficult problems studied in the literature, the DMOEA shows good performance in both converging to the true Pareto-optimal front and maintaining a widely distributed set of solutions. Second, a new definition of optimality (namely, L-optimality) is proposed in this paper, which not only takes into account the number of improved objective values but also considers the values of improved objective functions if all objectives have the same importance. We prove that L-optimal solutions are subsets of Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, the new algorithm based on L-optimality (namely, MDMOEA) is developed, and simulation and comparative results indicate that well-distributed L-optimal solutions can be obtained by utilizing the MDMOEA but cannot be achieved by applying L-optimality to make \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">posteriori</i>\n selection within the huge Pareto nondominated solutions.

In this paper, we propose a new method for super-resolution that uses sampling theory concepts to derive a noniterative SR algorithm. We first raise the issue of the validity of the data model usually assumed in SR, pointing out that it imposes a band-limited reconstructed image plus a certain type of noise. We propose a sampling theory framework with a prefiltering step that allows us to work with more general data models and also a specific new method for SR that uses Delaunay triangulation and B-splines to build the super-resolved image. The proposed method is noniterative and well posed. We prove its effectiveness against traditional iterative and noniterative SR methods on synthetic and real data. Additionally, we also prove that we can first solve the interpolation problem and then make the deblurring not only when the motion is translational but also when there are rotations and shifts and the imaging system point spread function (PSF) is rotationally symmetric.","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4623174/04623238.pdf","startPage":"1817","endPage":"1826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2002833","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2002833","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Image reconstruction","Strontium","Signal resolution","Data models","Interpolation","Image sampling","Sampling methods","Spline","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","interpolation","iterative methods","mesh generation","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noniterative interpolation","super-resolution minimizing aliasing","image reconstruction","point spread function","inverse problem","low-resolution undersampled images","sampling theory","Delaunay triangulation","B-splines","iterative methods","interpolation problem","point spread function imaging system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image reconstruction","inverse problem","nonuniform sampling","super-resolution"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Noniterative Interpolation-Based Super-Resolution Minimizing Aliasing in the Reconstructed Image","accessionNumber":"10185938","pubMedId":"18784030","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623238/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noniterative Interpolation-Based Super-Resolution Minimizing Aliasing in the Reconstructed Image","sourcePdf":"17tip10-asanchez-beato-2002833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080923S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4623174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4623174","articleId":"4623238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4623242,"authors":[{"name":"Chunming Li","affiliation":["Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Chunming Li received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Connecticut, Storrs, in 2005.","Between 2001 and 2003, he was a consultant for Robotics Technology Group, ABB Corporate Research, where he worked on image processing and camera calibration algorithms.

In order to overcome the difficulties caused by intensity inhomogeneities, we propose a region-based active contour model that draws upon intensity information in local regions at a controllable scale. A data fitting energy is defined in terms of a contour and two fitting functions that locally approximate the image intensities on the two sides of the contour. This energy is then incorporated into a variational level set formulation with a level set regularization term, from which a curve evolution equation is derived for energy minimization. Due to a kernel function in the data fitting term, intensity information in local regions is extracted to guide the motion of the contour, which thereby enables our model to cope with intensity inhomogeneity. In addition, the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically preserved by the level set regularization term to ensure accurate computation and avoids expensive reinitialization of the evolving level set function. Experimental results for synthetic and real images show desirable performances of our method.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2002304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4623174/04623242.pdf","startPage":"1940","endPage":"1949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2002304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimization of Region-Scalable Fitting Energy for Image Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623242/","displayDocTitle":"Minimization of Region-Scalable Fitting Energy for Image Segmentation","volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185942","pubMedId":"18784040","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623242/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimization of Region-Scalable Fitting Energy for Image Segmentation","sourcePdf":"17tip10-cli-2002304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072378S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4623174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"1135","xplore-issue":"4623174","articleId":"4623242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4623246,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37274615100"},{"name":"Chengjun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Chengjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280623000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"4623246","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":944},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Feature extraction","Frequency domain analysis","Color","Displays","Discrete Fourier transforms","Space technology","Pattern recognition","Computer vision","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","frequency-domain analysis","image classification","image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid color-frequency feature method","CFF","face recognition","enhanced fisher model","EFM","feature extraction","frequency domain","image classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Enhanced fisher model (EFM)","face recognition grand challenge (FRGC)","the RIQ color space"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Color","Colorimetry","Face","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"abstract":"This correspondence presents a novel hybrid Color and Frequency Features (CFF) method for face recognition.

Finally, numerical examples are included to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","volume":"53","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"10185955","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Tracking Controller Design of Nonlinear Systems With Time Delays and Unknown Dead-Zone Input","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Tracking Controller Design of Nonlinear Systems With Time Delays and Unknown Dead-Zone Input","sourcePdf":"53tac07-hua-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04077S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"4623249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"115","articleId":"4623262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4623264,"authors":[{"name":"Lirong Huang","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lirong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405927200"},{"name":"Feiqi Deng","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Feiqi","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271183100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4623264","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"Recently, Mao (1995) initiated the study of exponential stability of neutral stochastic functional differential equations (NSFDEs) and employed the Razumikhin techniques to investigated the stability problem of NSFDEs.

The paper has two parts. In the first part, we derive a conservation law dictating that causal feedback cannot reduce the differential entropy inserted in the loop by external sources. An interpretation of this result is that the total randomness induced by disturbances, as measured by differential entropy, cannot be reduced by causal feedback; it can only be re-allocated in time or in frequency (if well defined). Under asymptotic stationarity assumptions, this result has a spectral representation which constitutes an extension of Bode's inequality for arbitrary feedback. Our proofs make clear the role of causality, as well as how stability assumptions impact the final result. In the second part, we derive an inequality unveiling that the feedback loop must be able to convey information originating from two independent sources: 1) initial states of the physical plant; 2) exogenous disturbance signals. By using such principle, we construct a variety of information rate (information flux) inequalities. Furthermore, we derive a universal performance bound which is parameterized solely by the feedback capacity and the parameters of the plant. The latter is a new fundamental limitation, which is different from Bode's classical result, indicating that finite feedback capacity brings a new type of performance bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10185963","htmlLink":"/document/4623271/","displayDocTitle":"Feedback Control in the Presence of Noisy Channels: \u201cBode-Like\u201d Fundamental Limitations of Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback Control in the Presence of Noisy Channels: \u201cBode-Like\u201d Fundamental Limitations of Performance","sourcePdf":"53tac07-martins.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170819S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4623249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"4623249","articleId":"4623271","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4623690,"authors":[{"name":"William Lau","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["WILLIAM LAU (wlau@cse.unsw.edu.au) completed Bachelor's degree with a first class honours in computer engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, in 2000.

SPLO is shown to perform competitively with existing offline heuristics algorithm in terms of spare capacity. SPLO is designed for online computation where only one request is computed at any one time, and the decision making does not depend on future requests. The polynomial-time and online nature of the algorithm makes SPLO suitable for use in real-time on-demand path request applications. SPLO can be combined with a non-polynomial post-processing component that re-optimizes the backup paths. Significant reductions in spare capacity requirements are achievable at the expense of higher computation time. Further, the potential for SPLO as an algorithm in traffic engineering applications is investigated by looking at the performance impact when source-destination-based traffic aggregation is applied. We also introduce a new concept called path intermix where the service path's allocated bandwidth can be used by the backup paths protecting that particular service path.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure-Oriented Path Restoration Algorithm for Survivable Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2004.4623690","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275028/4623688/04623690.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2004.4623690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2004","displayDocTitle":"Failure-Oriented Path Restoration Algorithm for Survivable Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4623690/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"April 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure-Oriented Path Restoration Algorithm for Survivable Networks","sourcePdf":"LAU.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044921S","chronDate":"April  2004","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"4623688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4623688","articleId":"4623690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4623705,"authors":[{"name":"Mischa Schwartz","bio":{"p":["Jeremiah Hayes received his B.E.E. from Manhattan College in 1956, whereupon he joined the submarine cable department of Bell Laboratories, where he spent four years.

Although the transatlantic cable carrying these messages failed after a few weeks of operation, and it wasn't until 1866 that permanent transatlantic telegraph cable transmission became possible, the 1858 transmissions were heralded worldwide as a major achievement, introducing a new Age of Information. To commemorate this literally earth-shaking accomplishment 150 years ago, the History Column this month presents an article entitled \"A History of Transatlantic Cables\" by Jerry Hayes of Concordia University, Canada, a member of the ComSoc History Committee. Interestingly, it took almost another 100 years until the first transatlantic telephone cable, TAT-1, was successfully launched. Jerry covers this epoch-making event in his article as well, in addition to the various undersea telephone cables that followed in the years after.

In a network with nomadic users, this inevitably involves deploying more infrastructure, typically in the form of microcells, hot spots, distributed antennas, or relays. A less expensive alternative is the recent concept of femtocells - also called home base stations - which are data access points installed by home users to get better indoor voice and data coverage. In this article we overview the technical and business arguments for femtocells and describe the state of the art on each front. We also describe the technical challenges facing femtocell networks and give some preliminary ideas for how to overcome them.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","volume":"46","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10207944","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623708/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell networks: a survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell networks: a survey","sourcePdf":"014CHANDRASEKHAR.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053146S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4623694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"2337","xplore-issue":"4623694","articleId":"4623708","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4623722,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Hashemi","affiliation":["University of Southern California, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hossein Hashemi (hosseinh@usc.edu) is the Gordon S.

In addition, the reduced peak power demand from the diesel engine increases the engine life. Furthermore, because of the energy storage made available by the flywheels, the diesel engine can be reduced in size for greater fuel and emissions savings. Initial field tests with a reduced-size engine have yielded fuel savings of up to 35% and more. As an added measure of reliability, if a single flywheel system were to become inoperable, the crane can continue operating with the remaining flywheel. If desired, this lone flywheel can be configured to perform at elevated power levels for a limited time until the service can be completed.","doi":"10.1109/MIAS.2008.929351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/2943/4623726/04623741.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIAS.2008.929351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saving energy using flywheels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November-December  2008","displayDocTitle":"Saving energy using flywheels","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November-December 2008","accessionNumber":"10310739","htmlLink":"/document/4623741/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saving energy using flywheels","sourcePdf":"14mias06-flynn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050285S","chronDate":"November-December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"2943","isNumber":"4623726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4623726","articleId":"4623741","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4623754,"authors":[{"name":"Jaap Van De Beek","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jaap","lastName":"Van De Beek","id":"37533967000"},{"name":"Fredrik Berggren","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Berggren","id":"37268924900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4623754","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1254},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Pulse modulation","Disruption tolerant networking","Bandwidth","Signal design","Pulse shaping methods","Fourier transforms","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["out-of-band power suppression","non-data subcarriers","higher-order derivatives","OFDM symbol boundaries","out-of-band emission","adjacent-channel center-frequencies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","out-of-band emission","tone reservation"]}],"abstract":"In this letter we show that judicious modulation of non-data subcarriers renders a transmitted OFDM signal and a few of its higher-order derivatives continuous at the OFDM symbol boundaries.

The usefulness of the approximation is demonstrated by obtaining a simple closed form expression for the average symbol error probability of differentially encoded QPSK in Nakagami-m fading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytically Tractable Approximation for the Gaussian Q-Function","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2008.080815","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4623752/04623774.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2008.080815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623774/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Analytically Tractable Approximation for the Gaussian Q-Function","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4623774/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10208062","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytically Tractable Approximation for the Gaussian Q-Function","sourcePdf":"cl_0809_669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047514S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4623752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4623752","articleId":"4623774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4623775,"authors":[{"name":"Janghoon Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea (ROK)"],"firstName":"Janghoon","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406103400"},{"name":"Yohan Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea (ROK)"],"firstName":"Yohan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293234200"},{"name":"Hyukjin Chae","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea (ROK)"],"firstName":"Hyukjin","lastName":"Chae","id":"37692110800"},{"name":"Dong Ku Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea (ROK)"],"firstName":"Dong Ku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279322500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4623775","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Interference","Broadcasting","Numerical simulation","Optimal control","Performance analysis","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna theory","approximation theory","array signal processing","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random beamforming","multiple codebook","closed form approximation","signal to interference plus noise ratio","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Random beamforming","sum rate","SINR distribution","MIMO"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Closed Form Approximation of the Sum Rate of Random Beamforming with Multiple Codebooks and its Application to Control of the Number of Codebooks","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2008.080820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623752","endPage":"674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4623752/04623775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2008.080820","startPage":"672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623775","abstract":"In this letter, a closed form approximation of the sum rate of random beamforming with multiple codebooks is derived.

Furthermore, we show that a class of codes known as optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are the best possible positive codes. In obtaining the results we define normalized divergence based on signal-to-multipleaccess interference ratio (SIR) for a multiple-access system in a useful manner and use it as our criterion to maximize the multiple-access capability of the codes.

The possibility of constructing full diversity space time codes is investigated. A linear modulation approximation to CPM is done. Using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization transform the CPM signal is generated as a vector with finite energy in a different Euclidean space.

On the physical layer, a half-duplex relay node decodes-and- forwards the messages of two nodes in a two-phase protocol with optimal time-division. On the data link layer, we assume ergodic arrival processes at node 1 and 2 which have queues with infinite buffer length. At the beginning of each time-slot a centralized controller chooses the service rate pair which achieves the weighted rate sum maximum of the instantaneous achievable rate region for the block-fading channel state of the next time-slot with weights equal to the current buffer levels. To this end, the controller adjusts the time-division and relay power distribution. The policy is throughput optimal since the stability region is equal to the bidirectional ergodic rate region. This is because whenever the mean queue length is large, a negative drift of a quadratic Lyapunov function on the buffer levels can be proved.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4623786/04623807.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623786","startPage":"1519","endPage":"1529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability region of an optimized bidirectional regenerative half-duplex relaying protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability region of an optimized bidirectional regenerative half-duplex relaying protocol","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10207938","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623807/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability region of an optimized bidirectional regenerative half-duplex relaying protocol","sourcePdf":"tc_0809_1519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080175S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4623786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4623786","articleId":"4623807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4623809,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In this paper, a maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm that uses a two-element array is proposed for joint follower jamming rejection and symbol detection in slow FH/MFSK systems over quasi-static flat Rayleigh fading channels. The algorithm is derived by treating both the received jamming components and the unknown data symbols as deterministic quantities to be jointly estimated in an integrated ML operation. In addition, an approximate expression for the symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed scheme is derived when BFSK signaling is employed in a jamming dominant scenario. Analytical and simulated results show that the proposed approach is able to remove jamming and outperform the conventional and sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based beam-formers in the presence of a follower partial-band jammer.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4623786/04623809.pdf","startPage":"1536","endPage":"1544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML-based follower jamming rejection in slow FH/MFSK systems with an antenna array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623809/","displayDocTitle":"ML-based follower jamming rejection in slow FH/MFSK systems with an antenna array","volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10207941","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623809/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML-based follower jamming rejection in slow FH/MFSK systems with an antenna array","sourcePdf":"tc_0809_1536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08373S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4623786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4623786","articleId":"4623809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4623810,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Levorato","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4623786/4623810/4623810-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Levorato (S'06) was born in Venice on March 18th, 1980.

The distinctive feature of the work is that the focus in both the design and the evaluation is at the network level, rather than on a single link. To this end, we propose the use of spatial multiplexing and code division multiple access (CDMA) to increase the parallelism of transmissions in the network, thus improving throughput. Cooperation is also implemented by spatial multiplexing and CDMA, together with an adaptive hybrid automatic repeat request mechanism that adapts the retransmissions to the actual channel conditions. Spatial multiplexing allows frame-asynchronous transmissions and a flexible cooperation protocol that minimizes the signaling overhead. The resulting scheme is named layered coded cooperative system (LCCS). We propose an implementation of LCCS based on linear erasure packet codes, where cooperation is transparent to the receiver, and we assess the performance of LCCS both by analyzing a simple network with three nodes and by simulating a more complex network.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4623786/04623810.pdf","startPage":"1545","endPage":"1555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spatial multiplexing for ad hoc networks with hybrid ARQ: system design and performance analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Automatic repeat request","System analysis and design","Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","Code division multiplexing","Access protocols","Cooperative systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","antenna arrays","automatic repeat request","code division multiple access","MIMO communication","multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spatial multiplexing","ad hoc networks","hybrid ARQ","system design","performance analysis","multiple antennas","transmission mode","cooperation protocol","spatial multiplexing","code division multiple access","adaptive hybrid automatic repeat request mechanism","layered coded cooperative system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication signalling","wireless channels","automatic repeat request","cooperative systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spatial multiplexing for ad hoc networks with hybrid ARQ: system design and performance analysis","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4623810/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10207939","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spatial multiplexing for ad hoc networks with hybrid ARQ: system design and performance analysis","sourcePdf":"tc_0809_1545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093837S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4623786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4623786","articleId":"4623810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4623835,"authors":[{"name":"Alberico Menozzi","affiliation":["Applied Research Associates, Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4663184/4623835/4623835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberico Menozzi (S\u201991\u2013M\u201993) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, in 1998, where he pursued research on intelligent control using neural networks and fuzzy logic.","From 1998 to 2006, he worked at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division, Newport, RI, where he conducted basic and applied research in the areas of unmanned underwater system dynamics and control, control of electric drives, and neuroscience-based control.

The rigid cylindrical hull of the vehicle is attached with six strategically located fins to produce forces and moments in all orthogonal directions and axes with minimal redundancy. The fins are penguin-wing inspired and they implement the unsteady high-lift principle found widely in swimming and flying animals. The goal has been to design an underwater vehicle that is highly maneuverable by taking the inspiration from nature where unsteady hydrodynamic principles of lift generation and the phase synchronization of fins are common. We use cycle-averaged experimental data to analyze the hydrodynamic forces and moments produced by a single foil as a function of its kinematic motion parameters. Given this analysis, we describe a method for synthesizing and coordinating the sinusoidal motion of all six foils to produce any desired resultant mean force and moment vectors on the vehicle. The mathematics behind the resulting algorithm is elegant and effective, yielding compact and efficient implementation code. The solution method also considers and accommodates the inherent physical constraints of the foil actuators. We present laboratory experimental results that demonstrate the solution method and the vehicle's resulting high maneuverability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Open loop systems","Underwater vehicles","Remotely operated vehicles","Hydrodynamics","Motion analysis","Control systems","Mobile robots","Animals","Data analysis","Kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","control system synthesis","hydrodynamics","mobile robots","open loop systems","remotely operated vehicles","robot kinematics","underwater vehicles","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open-loop control system","multifin biorobotic rigid underwater vehicle","biorobotic autonomous underwater vehicle","BAUV","rigid cylindrical hull","hydrodynamic principles","hydrodynamic forces","kinematic motion parameters","sinusoidal motion","resultant mean force","moment vectors","foil actuators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)","biorobotics","high lift","maneuverability","open-loop control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JOE.2008.918687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4663184/04623835.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2008.918687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-Loop Control of a Multifin Biorobotic Rigid Underwater Vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Open-Loop Control of a Multifin Biorobotic Rigid Underwater Vehicle","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623835/","volume":"33","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623835/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10301413","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-Loop Control of a Multifin Biorobotic Rigid Underwater Vehicle","sourcePdf":"33joe02-menozzi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065012S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4663184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4663184","articleId":"4623835","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4623838,"authors":[{"name":"Maurizio Murroni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Murroni","id":"37323987300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623838","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623838","abstract":"Modulation with unequal power allocation (MUPA) is an unequal error protection technique (UEP) used when selective channel coding is barely suitable. This is the case of bandwidth constrained wireless communications where the overhead introduced by error control coding often turns out inefficient systems. On the other hand, MUPA protects data which exhibit different sensitivity to channel errors by distributing different transmission power to the modulation symbols according to the individual bit error sensitivities. MUPA has been studied in case of AWGN channel. In this work we propose an optimal power allocation scheme for the transmission of sensible data over fading channels. As to the optimization we rely on genetic algorithms (GA) which guarantee fast approximate solution with reduced complexity.

The detector is based on a two-stage detection followed by a decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The first detection stage is assured by a linear equalizer subsequently followed by a decision unit. The second step is a reduced search (RS) around the solution acquired by the linear equalization, which will be performed in an efficient way at the different transmitted data streams. The RS will be adjusted depending on the search probability at each level. The DFE is applied in order to remove the effect of the inter symbol interferences (ISI) caused by the channel dispersion as it has been observed in the indoor measurements. The RS method provides a near ML performance while it demands a fixed computational effort which is determined by the number of operations and limited by the hardware resources. Compared to some of the most important MIMO detectors, such as for example V-BLAST and sphere decoder, in simulations as well as in field measurements our approach exhibits a near ML performance in terms of BER while its computational effort always remains distinctly lower.","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623853","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623853.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low effort MIMO eetector for frequency selective indoor channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623853/","displayDocTitle":"Low effort MIMO eetector for frequency selective indoor channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10205230","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623853/","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low effort MIMO eetector for frequency selective indoor channels","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"A2-3_1569098423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084032S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE V erlag GmbH","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4623854,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Soon Kim","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Broadcasting Convergence Sector, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myung-Soon Kim","id":"37278676200"},{"name":"Jin-Up Kim","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Broadcasting Convergence Sector, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Up Kim","id":"37293482400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623854","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","MIMO","Strontium","Gain","Colored noise","Quantization","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","automatic gain control","MIMO communication","quantisation (signal)","signal detection","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO detection methods","multiple input multiple output detection methods","noise power","automatic gain control","analog to digital converters","quantization noise"]}],"abstract":"Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) detection methods are derived with an assumption that the noise power of all receiving paths are equal.

RAT are mainly characterized by the data rates they offer at a given distance of the access point (resp. base station). Dual-technology mobile stations (MS) are initiating downlink packet calls in the considered cell. A network controlled joint RRM algorithm is responsible to assign MS to a RAT, while taking into account the joint spatial distribution of already accepted MS, the current load of each RAT, the location of the newly accepted packet call and its influence on the global performance. Two classes of JRRM algorithms are considered. In a study based on the Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) theory, we show how to obtain optimal policies for each of these classes. Optimality is here defined through a utility function accounting for user satisfaction and blocking.","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623856","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623856.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SMDP approach for JRRM analysis in heterogeneous networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"SMDP approach for JRRM analysis in heterogeneous networks","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623856/","accessionNumber":"10205233","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623856/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMDP approach for JRRM analysis in heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"B2-2_1569098903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072834S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4623858,"authors":[{"name":"Abheek Saha","firstName":"Abheek","lastName":"Saha","id":"37703038600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623858","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Partitioning algorithms","Quality of service","Concurrent computing","WiMAX","Layout","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional frame composer","OFDMA WiMAX base-stations","floorplan slicing","two-dimensional allocation","quality of service"]}],"abstract":"The WiMAX OFDMA environment is unique in that it requires a two-dimensional allocation i.e. simultaneously in time and frequency on the downlink.

The computer simulations modeling IEEE 802.16 standard for broadband wireless access show, that the system performance is decreased less than 1dB compared to ML solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near Optimum Iterative Decoding of Block Codes in MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623864","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623864.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Near Optimum Iterative Decoding of Block Codes in MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623864/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10205241","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near Optimum Iterative Decoding of Block Codes in MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"A3-1_1569096883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061679S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE V erlag GmbHIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4623867,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Skoutas","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Systems Engineering, University of Aegean, Samos, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Skoutas","id":"37266563900"},{"name":"Dimitrios Komnakos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Komnakos","id":"37688478000"},{"name":"Demosthenes Vouyioukas","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Systems Engineering, University of Aegean, Samos, Greece"],"firstName":"Demosthenes","lastName":"Vouyioukas","id":"37332723600"},{"name":"Angelos Rouskas","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Systems Engineering, University of Aegean, Samos, Greece"],"firstName":"Angelos","lastName":"Rouskas","id":"37268508700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623867","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Scheduling","Silicon","Job shop scheduling","Multiaccess communication","Dynamic scheduling","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","dynamic scheduling","optimisation","radio links","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced dedicated channel scheduling optimization","enhanced uplink operation","WCDMA-UMTS system","transmission time interval","traffic flow","3GPP specification","dynamic priority scheduler decision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Enhanced Uplink","Packet Scheduling","QoS","WCDMA"]}],"abstract":"Enhanced Uplink operation of WCDMA-UMTS systems utilizes fast Node B scheduling and a short Transmission Time Interval (TTI) of 2ms. The scheduling decisions are based on scheduling information (SI) sent by each UE to the Node B. The main drawback of the current scheduling procedure is that the SI does not include any information regarding the delay sensitivity of each traffic flow, as well as the actual delay that the buffered data have experienced. In this paper, we propose the inclusion of such information in SI by introducing a modification of the respective 3GPP specifications. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic Priority Scheduler (DPS), which can utilize this new information. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by means of system level simulations.","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623867","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced dedicated channel scheduling optimization in WCDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced dedicated channel scheduling optimization in WCDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623867/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10205244","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623867/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced dedicated channel scheduling optimization in WCDMA","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"B3-1_1569099239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071917S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE V erlag GmbHIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4623873,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Nezampour","affiliation":["Iowa State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Nezampour","id":"37298780100"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"},{"name":"Yao Ma","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"lastName":"Yao Ma","id":"37087333621"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623873","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Artificial neural networks","AWGN","Neodymium","Covariance matrix","Signal to noise ratio","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","interference (signal)","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic analysis","space-time codes","Mahalonobis distance decoding","nonGaussian noise","interference","pairwise error probability","finite moments","Euclidean distance","noise decorrelating metric","coding gain","high signal-to-noise ratios","diversity gain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623873","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623873.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of space-time codes with Mahalonobis distance decoding in non-gaussian noise and interference","abstract":"In this paper, we derive simple and asymptotically tight expressions for the pairwise error probability (PEP) of coherent space-time codes (STCs) which are valid for any type of noise and interference with finite moments and detection with general Mahalonobis distance (MD) metrics including Euclidean distance (ED) and noise decorrelating (ND) metric.

Such CSI is usually reported from the receiver to the transmitter, causing a significant amount of feedback signaling burden. Recent work can noticeably reduce the feedback signaling burden by exploiting the channel correlation properties in the frequency domain, but it can be applied to the generation of a single beam [1]. In this paper, this idea is extended to the use of multiple beams for spatial multiplexing. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the performance using the same amount of feedback signaling burden or provide the same performance while noticeably reducing the amount of feedback signaling burden, compared to conventional schemes.","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623875","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623875.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit beamforming with reduced channel information in MIMO-OFDM wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623875/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming with reduced channel information in MIMO-OFDM wireless systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10205251","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623875/","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming with reduced channel information in MIMO-OFDM wireless systems","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"A4-2_1569098853.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11345S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4623886,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Philippe Javaudin","affiliation":["R&D Division, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Javaudin","id":"37293776600"},{"name":"Yiqi Jiang","affiliation":["Altran, Centre d'Affaires Alphasis, Saint Gregoire, France"],"lastName":"Yiqi Jiang","id":"37695290200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623886","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","MIMO","Interpolation","Interference","Time frequency analysis","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM-OQAM modulation scheme","iterative transceivers","conventional cyclic-prefix OFDM modulation","multiple-input multiple-output communication","radio channels","transmit antenna spatial data multiplexing scheme"]}],"abstract":"OFDM/OQAM modulation scheme is an alternative to the conventional cyclic-prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) modulation.

This paper presents a preliminary model with objective of providing tradeoff study of maximum tolerable cyclic delay value vs. performance impacts to the system.","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623890","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623890.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic delay diversity performance in OFDMA based system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623890/","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic delay diversity performance in OFDMA based system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10205265","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623890/","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic delay diversity performance in OFDMA based system","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"A5-5_1569097310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040904S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4623893,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Fan","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"lastName":"Zhong Fan","id":"37273608700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623893","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":354},"abstract":"60 GHz wireless networks have the potential to support high data rate applications, but have short range transmission limitations due to larger propagation losses and reduced diffraction around obstacles. On the other hand, directional antennas are easier to implement at millimeter wavelengths and can provide benefits such as spatial reuse and higher transmission range. This paper proposes a network architecture for 60 GHz wireless personal area networks (WPANs) using directional antennas. It describes protocols for neighbor discovery, medium access, and multi-hop route establishment that exploit directional antennas to improve network performance and maintain connectivity. As a result, the proposed method can be used as a practical, low-cost solution to overcome the difficulty of short range and large propagation loss in 60 GHz systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623893.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless networking with directional antennas for 60 GHz systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directive antennas","Media Access Protocol","Transmitting antennas","Antennas","Deafness","Protocols","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","millimetre wave antennas","personal area networks","protocols","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless networking","directional antennas","short range transmission limitations","propagation losses","millimeter wavelength antennas","wireless personal area networks","WPAN","protocols","multihop route","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60 GHz","directional antenna","MAC","multi-hop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Wireless networking with directional antennas for 60 GHz systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623893/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10187311","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless networking with directional antennas for 60 GHz systems","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"B5-3_1569097971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041363S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4623899,"authors":[{"name":"Maliatsos Konstantinos","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Maliatsos","lastName":"Konstantinos","id":"37550585500"},{"name":"Athanassios Adamis","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanassios","lastName":"Adamis","id":"37688500000"},{"name":"Philip Constantinou","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Constantinou","id":"37273139800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623899","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","OFDM","Manganese","Synchronization","Frequency synchronization","Receivers","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-to-nise ratio","SNR degradation","frequency synchronization errors","OFDMA systems","subband carrier allocation","phase noise","frequency dispersion","time shifts","mobile WiMax"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","time and frequency synchronization","SNR degradation","subband allocation"]}],"abstract":"Phase noise, frequency dispersion and time shifts are main challenges that concern OFDM systems. However, perfect synchronization between a transmitter and a receiver cannot be accomplished. These difficulties are dilated in an OFDMA system and consequently the performance degradation due to synchronization errors is increased. The receiver has the task to choose optimal sampling instants and to align the subcarrier frequencies of an OFDM symbol that contains signals from multiple users. In this study the effects of time and frequency synchronization errors are examined. The presented results refer to adjacent subcarrier permutation OFDMA systems where users are separated in bands of adjacent subcarriers. First an uplink OFDMA system model is presented and analytical relations explaining how synchronization errors cause both intercarrier and intersymbol interference are extracted. Then simulation results that quantify the SNR degradation due to synchronization errors are presented. The system used as a reference in this current study is the mobile WiMax with subband OFDMA allocation strategy and 1024 subcarriers.","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623899","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SNR degradation due to timing and frequency synchronization errors for OFDMA systems with subband carrier allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SNR degradation due to timing and frequency synchronization errors for OFDMA systems with subband carrier allocation","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623899/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10187312","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SNR degradation due to timing and frequency synchronization errors for OFDMA systems with subband carrier allocation","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"A6-2_1569099339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067081S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4623900,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungho Park","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University (ICU), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungho","lastName":"Park","id":"37697270700"},{"name":"Jongsub Chat","affiliation":["RFID/USN Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), 138 Gajeongno Yuseong-gu Daejeon 305-700, Korea"],"lastName":"Jongsub Chat","id":"37088035930"},{"name":"Joonhyuk Kang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University (ICU), Daejeon, Korea"],"lastName":"Joonhyuk Kang","id":"37087201665"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623900","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Encoding","MIMO","Lattices","Phase shift keying","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","iterative methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative precoding","multiuser broadcast channel","multiuser MIMO broadcast system","MIMO detection","depth first tree-search strategy","iterative QRD-M algorithm","computational complexity","sphere encoding","sequential algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623900","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623900.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QRD-M based iterative precoding for multi-user broadcast channel","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient precoding algorithm based on an iterative QRD-M for multiuser MIMO broadcast system. It has been shown that the iterative QRD-M algorithm can achieve near-ML performance with lower complexity at MIMO detection. Using depth first tree-search strategy, the first full expansion is tried by selecting the first level node with a minimum metric, constituting a reference metric. To find best sequence, it iteratively visits each node and terminates the expansion by comparing node metrics with the calculated reference metric. However, the iterative QRD-M algorithm applied in transmission side cannot significantly reduce the computational complexity, especially compared to sphere encoding. To further reduce the algorithm complexity, we introduce two additional techniques. One is to limit the search range according to the channel condition. In general, sequential algorithms show a variable amount of computation dependent on the channel condition. If the channel is ill-conditioned, we extend the search range. The other is to decide the reference metric that can be predetermined by the characteristic of VP and the first full expansion can also be pruned. By the pruning node during the first full expansion, the number of undesirable node visit can be further diminished. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the computational loads with a slight performance degradation, compared to that of the sphere encoding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623900/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10205273","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"QRD-M based iterative precoding for multi-user broadcast channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QRD-M based iterative precoding for multi-user broadcast channel","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"A6-3_1569098881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055116S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE V erlag GmbH","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4623901,"authors":[{"name":"Tamer A.

At the same time, measures are required which limit the interference on the frequency carriers. It is assumed that central entities performing the task of interference coordination with global knowledge should be avoided. Rather, distributed algorithms are sought for. To this end, we propose decentralized resource allocation algorithms that enable base stations to select a pool of favorable resources with low interference based on local knowledge only. The actual user-level resource allocation from that pool will then be performed by fast schedulers operating on the preselected resources within each cell. We analyze and evaluate the proposed resource selection algorithms by introducing a simplified wireless network model and applying methods from game theory. Proving the existence of Nash equilibria shows that stable resource allocations can be reached by selfish agents. In addition to that, we perform simulations to determine the speed of convergence and the resulting equilibrium interference levels. By comparing these to an optimal global solution, which is derived by solving an integer linear program, we are able to quantify the efficiency loss of the distributed game approach. It turns out that even though the distributed game results are sub-optimal, the low degree of system complexity and the inherent adaptability make the decentralized approach promising especially for dynamic scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623915.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623915","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Games","Nash equilibrium","Base stations","OFDM","Game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","distributed algorithms","game theory","integer programming","linear programming","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercell interference coordination","autonomous spectral reuse decisions","wireless packet switched cellular networks","dense frequency reuse","distributed algorithms","decentralized resource allocation algorithms","user-level resource allocation","Nash equilibria","integer linear program","distributed game approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decentralized inter-cell interference coordination by autonomous spectral reuse decisions","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10205286","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4623915/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623915/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized inter-cell interference coordination by autonomous spectral reuse decisions","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"B7-5_1569099286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05634S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE V erlag GmbH","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4623916,"authors":[{"name":"Maliatsos Konstantinos","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Maliatsos","lastName":"Konstantinos","id":"37550585500"},{"name":"Athanassios Adamis","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanassios","lastName":"Adamis","id":"37688500000"},{"name":"Philip Constantinou","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Constantinou","id":"37273139800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623916","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Filter bank","Finite impulse response filter","Band pass filters","Digital filters","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","channel bank filters","discrete Fourier transforms","frequency division multiple access","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver architectures","subband carrier allocation","phase noise","frequency dispersion","time synchronization","frequency synchronization","signal recovery","multiuser OFDM system","subcarrier frequency","filter banks","intercarrier interference","subcarrier permutation OFDMA systems","multirate signal processing","DFT","polyphase filters","computational workload"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","frequency offset","synchronization","polyphase filters","subband allocation","frequency correction"]}],"abstract":"OFDM systems are very sensitive in phase noise and frequency dispersion. Thus, time and frequency synchronization tasks are very crucial for the proper signal recovery in the receiver. The difficulties and challenges are multiplied if we consider a multiuser OFDM system (OFDMA) where the subcarriers are shared between different users. The receiver has the task to choose optimal sampling instants and to align the subcarrier frequencies of an OFDM symbol that contains signals from multiple users. In this study the use of filter banks is considered in order to reduce Intercarrier interference in such a system and simplify the synchronization procedures that must take place. The proposed schemes are applicable to adjacent subcarrier permutation OFDMA systems where users are separated in bands of adjacent subcarriers. In order to achieve low processing load, techniques of multirate signal processing are adopted. The DFT - polyphase filters are the basic elements of the processing chain. Moreover the filtering procedure is preferred to be divided in multiple stages. The computational workload for each structure is determined and some measures for the reduction of the computational burden are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver architectures for OFDMA systems with subband carrier allocation","publicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","doi":"10.1109/EW.2008.4623916","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610265/4623836/04623916.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EW.2008.4623916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4623916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4623916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Receiver architectures for OFDMA systems with subband carrier allocation","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4623916/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10205287","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver architectures for OFDMA systems with subband carrier allocation","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"C7-1_1569099277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056613S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610265","isNumber":"4623836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610265","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4623836","articleId":"4623916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE Verlag GmbH","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4623917,"authors":[{"name":"David Kuhling","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kuhling","id":"37304026200"},{"name":"Andreas Ibing","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ibing","id":"37304022700"},{"name":"Volker Jungnickel","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Jungnickel","id":"37280807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4623917","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","MIMO","Throughput","Interference","Interpolation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","equalisers","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","microprocessor chips","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM realtime implementation","3GPP LTE","MMSE equalizer matrix","CPU utilization","concurrent bidirectional processing","cell broadband engine processor"]}],"abstract":"We present a realtime implementation of the time-critical core functions for 12 times 12 MIMO-OFDM (12 data streams) with LTE parameters on a cell broadband engine processor.

This paper presents achievable average power efficiency for the OFDM signal when the Doherty and extended Doherty transmitters are employed. By modelling the envelope of OFDM signal as a Rayleigh-distributed signal, average power efficiency for the OFDM signal is calculated as a function of clipping probability. Numerical calculation results assuming an ideal class-B amplifier and predistortion linearizer show that average drain efficiency of the two amplifiers for a clipping probability of 0.1% are 50.5 and 55.6%, respectively.

Experimental results show that the proposed method can give better performance compared to the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier that is known as one of the best classifiers for decoding cognitive states.","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2008.76","startPage":"256","endPage":"260","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623957/4623958/04624014.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2008.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding Cognitive States from fMRI Data Using Single Hidden-Layer Feedforward Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Machine learning","Feedforward neural networks","Decoding","Humans","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","biomedical MRI","feedforward neural nets","Gaussian processes","image classification","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","cognitive states","fMRI data","hidden-layer feedforward neural networks","functional magnetic resonance imaging","human brain function","extreme learning machine","regularized least-squares ELM","Gaussian naive Bayes classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fMRI","Decoding cognitive states","Neural Network","SLFN","RLS-ELM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Decoding Cognitive States from fMRI Data Using Single Hidden-Layer Feedforward Neural Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4624014/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10187368","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding Cognitive States from fMRI Data Using Single Hidden-Layer Feedforward Neural Networks","confLoc":"Gyeongju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3322a256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080523S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4623957","isNumber":"4623958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4623957","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4623958","articleId":"4624014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4624038,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Hatami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Hatami","id":"37703340900"},{"name":"Saeed Seyedtabaii","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Seyedtabaii","id":"37546826400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3322-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4624038","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Gallium","Distance measurement","Decoding","Genetic algorithms","Training","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","genetic algorithms","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correcting output codes","genetic algorithm","classifier systems","dichotomies","Hamming decoding","margin decoding","evolutionary algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple classifier systems","Error correcting output codes","Genetic algorithm","Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)","Support Vector Machine (SVM)."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624038","abstract":"Error correcting output codes (ECOC) is one of the most valuable methods in building multiple classifier systems.

Mode choice is a pattern recognition problem, where different human behavior patterns determine the choices among alternative travel modes. Based on the functional similarity between artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision tree, the method of knowledge-based neural networks (KBNN) combines the rule induction of decision tree (DT) and the accurate approximation of ANN. One appeal of KBNN is the use of pattern association and error correction to represent a problem. This contrasts considerably with the random utility maximization framework in discrete choice modeling. So a network built by this method and a nested logit (NL) model are specified, estimated and comparatively evaluated. The prediction results show that KBNN model demonstrates the highest performance. The analysis of actual investigation data shows that the proposed KBNN model has fast convergence and high precision, which is of great importance for travel mode choice prediction.","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2008.54","startPage":"491","endPage":"496","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623957/4623958/04624057.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2008.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-Based Neural Networks and its Application in Discrete Choice Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Biological system modeling","Predictive models","Training","Transportation","Analytical models","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","knowledge based systems","neural nets","pattern recognition","travel industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge-based neural network","discrete choice analysis","travel mode choice forecast","travel behavior analysis","pattern recognition","functional similarity","decision tree","rule induction","pattern association","error correction","random utility maximization","nested logit model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["travel mode choice","ANN","DT","KBNN","NL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-Based Neural Networks and its Application in Discrete Choice Analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4624057/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10187388","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-Based Neural Networks and its Application in Discrete Choice Analysis","confLoc":"Gyeongju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3322a491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050823S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4623957","isNumber":"4623958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4623957","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4623958","articleId":"4624057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4624083,"authors":[{"name":"Khin Haymar Saw Hla","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Korea Aerospace University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Khin Haymar Saw","lastName":"Hla","id":"37294817300"},{"name":"YoungSik Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Korea Aerospace University, South Korea"],"firstName":"YoungSik","lastName":"Choi","id":"37066437400"},{"name":"Jong Sou Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Korea Aerospace University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Sou","lastName":"Park","id":"37293300800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3322-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4624083","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self Organized Mobility in Nanosensor Network Based on Particle Swarm Optimization and Coverage Criteria","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623957/4623958/04624083.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2008.207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623958","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2008.207","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Fluids","Chemicals","Monitoring","Particle swarm optimization","Temperature measurement","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensors","nanoelectronics","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self organized mobility","nanosensor network","particle swarm optimization","self organized control","nanosensor mobility","virtual search space","spatially distributed nanosensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","coverage","nanosensor network","nanorobots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624083","abstract":"This study presents a self organized control of nano sensor's mobility based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

In the proposed algorithm, one logistic chaotic system generates the random changing parameter to control the parameter of the other. The algorithm only disturbs the control parameter of the chaotic system, so the chaotic character of the system itself has not been destroyed. To implement the algorithm, its VLSI architecture with low hardware cost and fast speed is designed, and the FPGA realization is given.

In this paper features of hybridization in smart environment are described and usage of technology of hybrid expert systems based on shell ESWin is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2008.129","startPage":"488","endPage":"492","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623957/4624098/04624191.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2008.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Rule and Neural Network Based Framework for Ubiquitous Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Ferroelectric films","Nonvolatile memory","Artificial neural networks","Sensors","Artificial intelligence","Art"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge based systems","neural nets","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid rule","neural network","ubiquitous computing systems","knowledge representation","rule based technique","hybrid intelligent systems","smart environment","hybrid expert systems","ESWin"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid Intelligent Systems","Neural Networks","Rules","Knowledge based Systems","Ubiquitous Computing","Smart Environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Rule and Neural Network Based Framework for Ubiquitous Computing","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4624191/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10205475","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Rule and Neural Network Based Framework for Ubiquitous Computing","confLoc":"Gyeongju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3322b488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075911S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4623957","isNumber":"4624098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4623957","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4624098","articleId":"4624191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4624246,"authors":[{"name":"David Baneres","affiliation":["Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4796181/4624246/4624246-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Baneres received the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.

The similar temporal association patterns can reveal interesting relationships of data items which co-occur with a particular event over time. Most works in temporal association mining have focused on capturing special temporal regulation patterns such as cyclic patterns and calendar scheme-based patterns. However, our model is flexible in representing interesting temporal patterns using a user-defined reference sequence. The dissimilarity degree of the sequence of support values of an item set to the reference sequence is used to capture how well its temporal prevalence variation matches the reference pattern. By exploiting interesting properties such as an envelope of support time sequence and a lower bounding distance for early pruning candidate item sets, we develop an algorithm for effectively mining similarity-profiled temporal association patterns. We prove the algorithm is correct and complete in the mining results and provide the computational analysis. Experimental results on real data as well as synthetic data show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than a sequential method using a traditional support-pruning scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4624259/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10731667","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Similarity-Profiled Temporal Association Mining","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Similarity-Profiled Temporal Association Mining","sourcePdf":"ttk2009081147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110575S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5109889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5109889","articleId":"4624259","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4624272,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5256019/4624272/4624272-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaogang Wang received the BS degree in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2001, the MS degree in information engineering from Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2003, and the PhD degree from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009.

Our system has three components: 1) given a face photo, synthesizing a sketch drawing; 2) given a face sketch drawing, synthesizing a photo; and 3) searching for face photos in the database based on a query sketch drawn by an artist. It has useful applications for both digital entertainment and law enforcement. We assume that faces to be studied are in a frontal pose, with normal lighting and neutral expression, and have no occlusions. To synthesize sketch/photo images, the face region is divided into overlapping patches for learning. The size of the patches decides the scale of local face structures to be learned. From a training set which contains photo-sketch pairs, the joint photo-sketch model is learned at multiple scales using a multiscale MRF model. By transforming a face photo to a sketch (or transforming a sketch to a photo), the difference between photos and sketches is significantly reduced, thus allowing effective matching between the two in face sketch recognition. After the photo-sketch transformation, in principle, most of the proposed face photo recognition approaches can be applied to face sketch recognition in a straightforward way. Extensive experiments are conducted on a face sketch database including 606 faces, which can be downloaded from our Web site (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/facesketch.html).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5256019/04624272.pdf","startPage":"1955","endPage":"1967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Photo-Sketch Synthesis and Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Humans","Image databases","Psychology","Shape","Markov random fields","Nose","Law enforcement","Information retrieval","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image processing","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","photo-sketch synthesis","multiscale Markov random fields model","query sketch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","face sketch synthesis","face sketch recognition","multiscale Markov random field."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Face","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Paintings","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Photography","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique","User-Computer Interface"]},{"kwd":["Face and gesture recognition","Image-based rendering","Applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Face Photo-Sketch Synthesis and Recognition","volume":"31","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4624272/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880601","pubMedId":"19762924","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Photo-Sketch Synthesis and Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2009111955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068487S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5256019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"463","xplore-issue":"5256019","articleId":"4624272","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4624294,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Stauffer","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Stauffer","id":"37301861000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-1900-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4624294","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Cameras","Computational modeling","Conferences","Computer vision","Pattern recognition","Maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating Tracking Sources and Sinks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624294","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10036","startPage":"35","endPage":"35","publicationTitle":"2003 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624277/4624292/04624294.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624292","abstract":"When tracking in a particular environment, objects tend to appear and disappear at certain locations.

Further, knowledge of these locations is useful for activity-level descriptions of tracking sequences and for understanding relationships between non-overlapping camera views. This paper introduces a method for simultaneously solving these coupled problems: inferring the parameters of a source and sink model for a scene; and fixing broken tracking sequences and other tracking failures.

Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a a time scale in the order of 40 milliseconds. The level of uncertainty at this time scale is considerable, making it necessary for humans and machines to rely on sensory rich perceptual primitives rather than slow symbolic inference processes. In this paper we present progress on one such perceptual primitive. The system automatically detects frontal faces in the video stream and codes them with respect to 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The face finder employs a cascade of feature detectors trained with boosting techniques [15, 2]. The expression recognizer receives image patches located by the face detector. A Gabor representation of the patch is formed and then processed by a bank of SVM classifiers. A novel combination of Adaboost and SVM's enhances performance. The system was tested on the Cohn-Kanade dataset of posed facial expressions [6]. The generalization performance to new subjects for a 7- way forced choice correct. Most interestingly the outputs of the classifier change smoothly as a function of time, providing a potentially valuable representation to code facial expression dynamics in a fully automatic and unobtrusive manner. The system has been deployed on a wide variety of platforms including Sony's Aibo pet robot, ATR's RoboVie, and CU animator, and is currently being evaluated for applications including automatic reading tutors, assessment of human-robot interaction.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10057","publicationTitle":"2003 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624277/4624302/04624313.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real Time Face Detection and Facial Expression Recognition: Development and Applications to Human Computer Interaction.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-22 June 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624313/","displayDocTitle":"Real Time Face Detection and Facial Expression Recognition: Development and Applications to Human Computer Interaction.","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2003","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4624313/","conferenceDate":"16-22 June 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real Time Face Detection and Facial Expression Recognition: Development and Applications to Human Computer Interaction.","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"210550053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059442S","chronDate":"16-22 June 2003","xplore-pub-id":"4624277","isNumber":"4624302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624277","citationCount":"268","xplore-issue":"4624302","articleId":"4624313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4624348,"authors":[{"name":"Hajime Nagahara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hajime","lastName":"Nagahara","id":"37272327500"},{"name":"Yasushi Yagi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Yagi","id":"37275158100"},{"name":"Masahiko Yachida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Yachida","id":"37275163300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-1900-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4624348","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mirrors","Image resolution","Head","Optics","Image sensors","Optical distortion","Pixel"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the omnidirectional image sensors have been applied to tele-presence systems, because the sensor can capture images with large field of views at video rate. On the other hand, head mount display (HMD) has been generally used as a personal display for virtual reality applications such as a tele-presence. However, almost all HMDs have a problem that the field of view (FOV), about 60 degree horizontally, of its presented image was terribly narrower than that of human. The problem makes reality and immersion lower in these applications. In this paper, we propose high-immersive visualization system that can display 180 degrees horizontal view by using a new catadioptrical HMD and an omnidirectional image sensor. The HMD consists of ellipsoidal and hyperboloidal curved mirrors, and can display 180 degrees horizontal view.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10070","publicationTitle":"2003 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624277/4624330/04624348.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide Field of View Head Mounted Display for Tele-presence with An Omnidirectional Image Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-22 June 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624348/","displayDocTitle":"Wide Field of View Head Mounted Display for Tele-presence with An Omnidirectional Image Sensor","volume":"7","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2003","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4624348/","conferenceDate":"16-22 June 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide Field of View Head Mounted Display for Tele-presence with An Omnidirectional Image Sensor","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"210570086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077825S","chronDate":"16-22 June 2003","xplore-pub-id":"4624277","isNumber":"4624330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624277","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4624330","articleId":"4624348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4624349,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuele Menegatti","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Menegatti","id":"37317887300"},{"name":"Alberto Scarpa","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Scarpa","id":"37687846600"},{"name":"Dario Massarin","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Italy"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Massarin","id":"37689615400"},{"name":"Enrico Ros","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Ros","id":"37703169900"},{"name":"Enrico Pagello","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Pagello","id":"37317887500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-1900-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4624349","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Robot sensing systems","Time measurement","Sensors","Machine vision","Tracking","Position measurement"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a system designed to cooperatively track and share the information about moving objects using a multi-robot team.

The cooperation of the vision sensors enhances the capabilities of the single vision sensor. This work was implemented in the RoboCup domain, using our team of heterogeneous robot, but the approach is very general and can be used in any application where a team of robot has to track multiple objects.

The main idea behind the method is to translate the task of calculating the LDA classification rule into the problem of determining the coefficients of an augmented generative model (PCA). Specifically, we construct an augmented PCA basis which, on the one hand, contains information necessary for the classification (in the LDA sense), and, on the other hand, enables us to calculate the necessary coefficients by means of a subsampling approach resulting in a high breakdown point classification. The theoretical results are evaluated on the ORL face database showing that the proposed method significantly outperforms the standard LDA.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10089","startPage":"97","endPage":"97","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624277/4624351/04624360.pdf","publicationTitle":"2003 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust LDA Classification by Subsampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-22 June 2003","displayDocTitle":"Robust LDA Classification by Subsampling","conferenceDate":"16-22 June 2003","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4624360/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624360/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust LDA Classification by Subsampling","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"210580097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060379S","chronDate":"16-22 June 2003","xplore-pub-id":"4624277","isNumber":"4624351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624277","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4624351","articleId":"4624360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4624362,"authors":[{"name":"Hedvig Sidenbladh","affiliation":["Department Autonomous Systems, Division Systems Technology, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hedvig","lastName":"Sidenbladh","id":"37271015400"},{"name":"Sven-Lennart Wirkander","affiliation":["Department Data and Information Fusion, Division Command and Control Systems, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sven-Lennart","lastName":"Wirkander","id":"37372826100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-1900-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4624362","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tracking","Hidden Markov models","Vehicles","Filtering","Target tracking","Particle filters","Bayesian methods"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a particle filtering formulation for tracking an unknown and varying number of vehicles in terrain.

In this paper we define context-aware computing, and describe four catagories of context-aware applications: proximate selection, automatic contextual reconfiguration, contextual information and commands, and contex-triggered actions. Instances of these application types have been prototyped on the PARCTAB, a wireless, palm-sized computer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Aware Computing Applications","publicationTitle":"1994 First Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications","doi":"10.1109/WMCSA.1994.16","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 First Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624408/4624409/04624429.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMCSA.1994.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624409","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Context-Aware Computing Applications","conferenceDate":"8-9 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Aware Computing Applications","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"34510085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066004S","chronDate":"8-9 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"4624409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624408","citationCount":"1332","articleId":"4624429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4624441,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

Due to the prohibitively long simulation time when running the full dynamic instruction streams of benchmarks on simulators in detailed simulation mode, many use sampling simulation to accelerate the simulation speed without sacrificing the accuracy greatly. However, the simulation speed of most existing simulators still can not satisfy the computer architects.\u00a0\u00a0This paper presents the Two-Stage Systematic Sampling (TSSS) approach to accelerate the micro-architecture simulation. As other simulation sampling methods, only a subset of benchmark instructions are simulated and measured in detail. But selecting the instructions through two-stage systematic sampling approach has advantages in theory and practice. Tests of 7 benchmarks from SPEC CPU2000 show that this approach can achieve only 0.06% IPC error while the simulation time is only 1/23 of the time needed by sim-outorder. In the same condition, the IPC error of SMARTS which is the best existing simulator is 1.14% and the simulation time of SMARTS is 1/21 of the time needed by sim-outorder.

The main advantages of the new indicators are the following: (1) accentuate insensitivity to disturbs such as load torque, drive inertia, and frequency variations; (2) low dependence with respect to machine parameters (except the pole number); and (3) linear dependence on fault gravity. They can be directly applied on motors fed by open-loop low-switching frequency gate turn-off/thyristor converters. Railway traction drives are possible targets. Application to mains-fed motors can be tried too, if suitable harmonics are present in the plant supply. A detailed analytical formulation for fault indicators is furnished, based on the multiphase symmetrical component theory; theoretical results have been supported by experimental work, performed by using a motor with an appositely prepared cage, and successively, method validation was achieved on three other industrial motors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2004669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681672","startPage":"4137","endPage":"4155","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4681672/04624536.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Application of Particular Current Signatures (Symptoms) for Cage Monitoring in Nonsinusoidally Fed Motors With High Rejection to Drive Load, Inertia, and Frequency Variations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4624536/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Application of Particular Current Signatures (Symptoms) for Cage Monitoring in Nonsinusoidally Fed Motors With High Rejection to Drive Load, Inertia, and Frequency Variations","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348767","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Application of Particular Current Signatures (Symptoms) for Cage Monitoring in Nonsinusoidally Fed Motors With High Rejection to Drive Load, Inertia, and Frequency Variations","sourcePdf":"tie-bruzzese-2004669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126072S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4624536","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4624538,"authors":[{"name":"Kah-Wee Ang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kah-Wee","lastName":"Ang","id":"37285848700"},{"name":"Ming-Bin Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ming-Bin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275738400"},{"name":"Guo-Qiang Lo","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guo-Qiang","lastName":"Lo","id":"37283457400"},{"name":"Dim-Lee Kwong","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dim-Lee","lastName":"Kwong","id":"37275443200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4624538","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":873},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Germanium","Phototransistors","Optical detectors","Epitaxial growth","Optical sensors","Photodetectors","Optical receivers","PIN photodiodes","Optical buffering","Photoconductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar transistors","germanium","photoconductivity","phototransistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-responsivity germanium bipolar phototransistor","optical detections","near-infrared regime","epitaxy process","photodetectors","photoresponse","near-infrared wavelength regime","voltage 1 V","Ge"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Germanium (Ge)","near-infrared","phototransistor"]},{"kwd":["Germanium (Ge)","near-infrared","phototransistor"]}],"abstract":"Germanium (Ge) bipolar phototransistors with high-responsivity performance are demonstrated using a low-temperature selective Ge epitaxy process.

The control objective is to regulate both actuated and unactuated joints to desired positions. The proposed synthesis combines second-order sliding-mode (SOSM) control methods and a pure technical solution of imposing a relatively stronger dry friction on the unactuated joint as compared to that of the actuated joint. This design feature allows us to decouple the hybrid synthesis procedure into two steps. At the first step, a SOSM control algorithm is utilized to drive the unactuated link to the desired position in finite time. Once this task is achieved, the control input is switched to another SOSM algorithm which drives the actuated link to its desired position. As the amplitude of the controller used at the second step is smaller than the Coulomb friction level in the unactuated link, but it is greater than that in the actuated link, the unactuated link remains at rest, whereas the actuated link is regulated to the endpoint of interest. Performance issues of the developed synthesis, including robustness features of the closed-loop system, are illustrated in an experimental study made for a laboratory horizontal 2-DOF pendulum. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2004660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4663160/04624543.pdf","startPage":"3998","endPage":"4003","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2004660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Sliding-Mode-Based Control of Underactuated Systems With Dry Friction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Sliding-Mode-Based Control of Underactuated Systems With Dry Friction","volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4624543/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10291064","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Sliding-Mode-Based Control of Underactuated Systems With Dry Friction","sourcePdf":"tie-martinez-2004660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064914S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4663160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4663160","articleId":"4624543","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4624545,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Wu","affiliation":["Signal Processing Systems Group, PT 3.27, Department of Electrical Engineering, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281223600"},{"name":"Samir Attallah","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, SIM University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Attallah","id":"37279227900"},{"name":"J.

The optimal subcarrier placement that minimizes the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the CFO estimation was reported by Ghogho. In this paper, we study the optimality of the null subcarrier placement from another perspective. We first show that the SNR of the CFO estimation using null subcarriers is a function of the null subcarrier placement. We then formulate the CFO-SNR optimization for the null subcarrier placement as a convex optimization problem for small CFO values and derive the optimal placement when the number of subcarriers is a multiple of the number of null subcarriers. In addition, we show that the SNR-optimal null subcarrier placement also minimizes the theoretical mean square error in the high SNR region. When the number of subcarriers is not a multiple of the number of null subcarriers, we propose a heuristic method for the null subcarrier placement that still achieves good performance in the CFO estimation. We also discuss the optimality of the null subcarrier placement in practical OFDM systems, where guard bands are required at both ends of the spectrum.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Optimality of the Null Subcarrier Placement for Blind Carrier Offset Estimation in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2005574","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4897220/04624545.pdf","startPage":"2109","endPage":"2115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2005574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897220","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Optimality of the Null Subcarrier Placement for Blind Carrier Offset Estimation in OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4624545/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601653","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Optimality of the Null Subcarrier Placement for Blind Carrier Offset Estimation in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-wu-2005574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086121S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4897220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4897220","articleId":"4624545","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4624546,"authors":[{"name":"Mylene Pischella","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, France Telecom, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4897220/4624546/4624546-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mylene Pischella received the engineer diploma in telecommunications in 2002 from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Paris, France, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Since 2002, she has been a Research Engineer with France Telecom, Research and Development Division, Issy Moulineaux cedex 9, France, and has been involved in several European IST projects.

To determine the conditions of the stator insulation system of motor drive systems, various testing and monitoring methods have been developed. This paper presents an in-depth literature review of testing and monitoring methods, categorizing them into online and offline methods, each of which is further grouped into specific areas according to their physical nature. The main focus of this paper is on testing and monitoring techniques that diagnose the condition of the turn-to-turn insulation of low-voltage machines, which is a rapidly expanding area for both research and product development efforts. In order to give a compact overview, the results are summarized in two tables. In addition to monitoring methods on turn-to-turn insulation, some of the most common methods to assess the stator's phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase insulation conditions are included in the tables as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4681672/04624549.pdf","startPage":"4127","endPage":"4136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2004665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2004665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Testing and Monitoring Methods for Stator Insulation Systems of Low-Voltage Induction Machines Focusing on Turn Insulation Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulation testing","System testing","Condition monitoring","Induction machines","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Costs","Electric breakdown","Stator windings","Power generation economics","Energy loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","electric breakdown","induction motor drives","machine insulation","machine testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monitoring method","stator insulation system","low-voltage induction machine","machine testing","electrical insulation system","catastrophic failure","motor drive system","stator phase-to-ground insulation","phase-to-phase insulation condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Induction motors","interturn shorts","motor diagnostics","stator faults","winding insulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Testing and Monitoring Methods for Stator Insulation Systems of Low-Voltage Induction Machines Focusing on Turn Insulation Problems","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4624549/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348768","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Testing and Monitoring Methods for Stator Insulation Systems of Low-Voltage Induction Machines Focusing on Turn Insulation Problems","sourcePdf":"tie-grubic-2004665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163573S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"292","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4624549","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4624550,"authors":[{"name":"Jari Ylioinas","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4897220/4624550/4624550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jari Ylioinas (S'05) received the M.Sc.

This method is based on a representation space, a selection criterion, and a decision criterion. In order to define the representation space, an optimized time-frequency representation (TFR) is designed from the time-frequency ambiguity plane. The selection criterion is based on Fisher's discriminant ratio, which allows one to maximize the separability between classes representing different faults. A distinct TFR is designed for each class. The following two classifiers were used for decision criteria: the Mahalanobis distance and the hidden Markov model. The flexibility of this method allows an accurate classification independent from the level of load. This method is validated on a 5.5-kW induction motor test bench.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4681672/04624556.pdf","startPage":"4290","endPage":"4298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2004666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2004666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Induction Machine Faults by Optimal Time\u2013Frequency Representations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction machines","Hidden Markov models","Stator windings","Fault diagnosis","Induction motors","Rotors","Thermal stresses","Stator cores","Machine windings","Machinery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","hidden Markov models","induction motors","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction machine faults","optimal time-frequency representations","current waveforms","representation space","selection criterion","decision criterion","time-frequency ambiguity plane","Fisher discriminant ratio","Mahalanobis distance","hidden Markov model","induction motor test bench","power 5.5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diagnosis","hidden Markov model (HMM)","induction motor","time\u2013frequency classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Induction Machine Faults by Optimal Time\u2013Frequency Representations","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4624556/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348769","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Induction Machine Faults by Optimal Time\u2013Frequency Representations","sourcePdf":"tie-lebaroud-2004666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057484S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4624556","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4624557,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Uk Cho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4796879/4624557/4624557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jung Uk Cho received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, in 2001, 2003, and 2006, respectively.","From 2006 to 2007, he was a Research Instructor with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University.

The quasi-Yagi antenna is used not only as the radiating element, but also as the output power combiner and the resonating load of the differential VCO without any matching circuits or transition between them. The two sub-oscillators of the VCO on the opposite sides of the substrate share a common quarter-wavelength DSPSL resonator and a common inserted ground plane, which also works as the reflecting element for the quasi-Yagi antenna. The common DSPSL resonator terminated by a series varactor can not only help to synchronize the two sub-oscillators, but also realize tunable oscillating frequency. Due to the differential output of the proposed VCO, the cross polarization of the proposed VCIAO is suppressed to a great extent in the entire tunable frequency range.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2003138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4639613","startPage":"2207","endPage":"2212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4639613/04624564.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Differential Voltage-Controlled Integrated Antenna Oscillator Based on Double-Sided Parallel-Strip Line","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4624564/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Differential Voltage-Controlled Integrated Antenna Oscillator Based on Double-Sided Parallel-Strip Line","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10236533","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Differential Voltage-Controlled Integrated Antenna Oscillator Based on Double-Sided Parallel-Strip Line","sourcePdf":"56tmtt10-jshi-2003138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059121S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4639613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4639613","articleId":"4624564","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4624566,"authors":[{"name":"Kashif Saeed","affiliation":["Institute of Microwaves and Photonics, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4639613/4624566/4624566-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kashif Saeed (S'07) received the B.Eng.

After illustrating the bandwidth limitations, a new result has been derived: if stability in terms of passivity of the haptic device is desired, the renderable stiffness is bounded by the stiffness of the SEA's elastic component. In practical experiments with the VMC, the aforementioned limitations affected the control performance. Desired gait modifications were not tracked exactly, because the subjects were able to deviate from the prescribed pattern even in the stiffest possible configuration. Despite the limitations, the practical experiments also demonstrated the general effectiveness of the realization. Manipulation of selected gait parameters is possible, whereby other parameters are left unaffected. This high selectivity is made possible by the low level of undesired interaction torques, which is achieved by elastic decoupling of motor mass and a lightweight exoskeleton. The discrepancy between theoretical bounds and rendered stiffness indicated that healthy subjects might represent a stabilizing component of the coupled system, which could be different for patients. In light of the theoretical stability analysis and with the focus on patients, the LOPES actuation was slightly modified. The robot was equipped with stiffer springs to obtain sufficient stiffness and to ensure stability without relying on stabilizing effects of the human. For this application, the disadvantages of compliant actuation can thus be tolerated or dealt with, and they are small compared with the advantages. Given that a rehabilitation robot, in the first place, is supposed to imitate therapist action, the limitations of bandwidth and stiffness do not pose severe problems. In contrast, safety and backdrivability are highly relevant, and they can be ensured easier with a compliant actuator. Therefore, we conclude that compliant actuation and a lightweight exoskeleton provide effective means to accomplish the desired AAN behavior of a rehabilitation robot. The next step is to evaluate the robot behavior, control performance, and therapeutic effectiveness in patient studies.","doi":"10.1109/MRA.2008.927689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/100/4624568/04624584.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2008.927689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compliant actuation of rehabilitation robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","displayDocTitle":"Compliant actuation of rehabilitation robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624584/","publicationDate":"September 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10208041","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4624584/","volume":"15","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compliant actuation of rehabilitation robots","sourcePdf":"15mra03-vallery.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100243S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"100","isNumber":"4624568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"100","citationCount":"313","xplore-issue":"4624568","articleId":"4624584","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4624600,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.

The probe's optical spectrum changes with the accumulated CD on the input signal, indicating that the optical power variations can be measured for monitoring. The experimental results show that this technique can monitor up to 120 ps/nm of CD for a 40-Gb/s return-to-zero differential phase-shift keying (RZ-DPSK) transmission system, with the maximum measured optical power increment of 16.5 dB. The applicability of this monitoring technique to higher bit-rate phase-modulated signals, such as 80-Gb/s RZ differential quadrature phase-shift keying and 80-Gb/s polarization-multiplexed RZ-DPSK, is also investigated via simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4624643/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2008","accessionNumber":"10208016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"19","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Chromatic Dispersion Monitoring for Phase-Modulated Signals Utilizing Cross-Phase Modulation in a Highly Nonlinear Fiber","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Chromatic Dispersion Monitoring for Phase-Modulated Signals Utilizing Cross-Phase Modulation in a Highly Nonlinear Fiber","sourcePdf":"lpt-yang-2002740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053305S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4618640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4618640","articleId":"4624643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4624769,"authors":[{"name":"Millie Pant","affiliation":["Department. of Paper Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Millie","lastName":"Pant","id":"37603464400"},{"name":"Radha Thangaraj","affiliation":["Center of Excellence Quantifiable Quality of Service, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Radha","lastName":"Thangaraj","id":"37602969200"},{"name":"Ajith Abraham","affiliation":["Department. of Paper Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Ajith","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37297713700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3299-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-4188"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-3915"}],"articleNumber":"4624769","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624769","abstract":"Two new variants of particle swarm optimization (PSO) called AMPSO1 and AMPSO2 are proposed for global optimization problems.

The WiMAX networks support high speed transmission. But some hardware design, such as the IQ (inphase quadrature) imbalance due to direct conversion in RF front-end, limits their throughput. This problem is especially serious in high-order modulation. Most current papers of this field focus on OFDM based systems, such as wireless local area networks (WLAN). Little attention has been paid to OFDMA based WiMAX systems. So we propose some time-domain compensation strategies to work on this problem according to the preamble symbol. In order to test the performance of compensation, we carry out simulation experiments in AWGN and multi-path fading conditions respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed strategies offer good effect.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IQ Imbalance Compensation in OFDMA based WiMAX Digital Receivers","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.82","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624812/4624813/04624896.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"IQ Imbalance Compensation in OFDMA based WiMAX Digital Receivers","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4624896/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10205673","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IQ Imbalance Compensation in OFDMA based WiMAX Digital Receivers","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3308a388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035835S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4624812","isNumber":"4624813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624812","xplore-issue":"4624813","articleId":"4624896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4624905,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Jingmei","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Jingmei","id":"37266407800"},{"name":"Zhai Yongzhi","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhai","lastName":"Yongzhi","id":"37398098600"},{"name":"Gao Shesheng","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Shesheng","id":"37680292200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3308-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4624905","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624905","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Signal processing","Acoustics","Estimation","AWGN","Wireless sensor networks","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","sampling methods","statistical distributions","target tracking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target location","self-organized sensor networks","perfect sampling","concentric circle model","ad-hoc networks","stochastic distribution","maximum posterior likelihood function","posterior distribution","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Target location","Self-organized sensor networks","Perfect sampling","Posterior distribution"]}],"abstract":"An equivalent center of concentric circle model in target location based on self-organized sensor networks (ad-hoc) is derived.

In this paper we propose a modified simulated annealing algorithm for scheduling independent tasks in Grid environment. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm improves the performance of static instances compared to the results of other algorithms reported in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.163","startPage":"623","endPage":"627","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624812/4624813/04624942.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Static Task Scheduling in Grid Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Scheduling","Mathematical model","Gallium","Computational modeling","Schedules","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","grid computing","optimisation","scheduling","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing algorithm","static task scheduling","grid computing","NP-complete","heterogeneous computing suite"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Static Task Scheduling in Grid Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4624942/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10205705","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Static Task Scheduling in Grid Computing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3308a623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046172S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4624812","isNumber":"4624813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624812","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4624813","articleId":"4624942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4624944,"authors":[{"name":"Ge Dongyuan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical & Auto Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Dongyuan","id":"37658551800"},{"name":"Yao Xifan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical & Auto Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Xifan","id":"37689498800"},{"name":"Zhang Qing","affiliation":["School of Mechanical & Auto Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Qing","id":"37685699500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3308-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4624944","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Machine vision","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Performance analysis","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","computer vision","gradient methods","matrix algebra","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine vision","backpropagation neural network self-learning","gradient descend method","projection matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Back propagation Neural Network","Binocular Vision System","Performance Index","Lyapunov Function","Convergence"]}],"abstract":"The precision of machine vision calibration is affected by those factors such as the loss of depth information, distortion of camera lens, and errors caused by image processing. In this paper machine vision system is developed by means of BP neural network with self- learning. There are 4 inputs, which are the image coordinates of a match point in left and right camera, and 3 outputs in the network. The sum square of errors between the outputs of the network and actual coordinates in world system is taken as performance index. The network weights are tuned in the light of gradient descend method and can be achieved stable value while the given sum square of errors is reached. Thus each projection matrix of two cameras of machine vision system can be replaced by the weights and the activation function of the neural network, and calibration of system is finished. Finally, the precision analysis is carried out for the system.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.190","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624812/4624813/04624944.pdf","startPage":"632","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Machine Vision System Based on BP Neural Network Self-learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4624944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624944/","displayDocTitle":"Development of Machine Vision System Based on BP Neural Network Self-learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10205707","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4624944/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Machine Vision System Based on BP Neural Network Self-learning","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3308a632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068289S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4624812","isNumber":"4624813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624812","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4624813","articleId":"4624944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4624951,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Talha Ahmed","affiliation":["NUST School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Talha","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38184452600"},{"name":"Junaid Khalid","affiliation":["NUST School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Junaid","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37689470400"},{"name":"Khalida Noori","affiliation":["NUST School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Khalida","lastName":"Noori","id":"37300804800"},{"name":"Sami Ahmed Haider","affiliation":["NUST-Military College of Signals"],"firstName":"Sami Ahmed","lastName":"Haider","id":"37300804400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3308-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4624951","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"abstract":"In this paper we use multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) with recursive least square (RLS) equalizer used for channel estimation and equalization then compare it with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).

Obtaining such sequences is a combinational problem. If the auto correlation and cross correlation are taken in the aperiodic sense then there are hardly any theoretical aids available. The main criterion for good pulse compression sequence is the Merit factor and discrimination. Thus the problem of signal design referred to above are challenging problem for which many global optimization algorithms like genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, tunneling algorithm were reported in the literature. All these optimization algorithms have serious drawbacks of non guaranteed convergence, slow convergence rate and require large number of evaluations of the objective function. To overcome these drawbacks, recently we proposed an efficient VLSI architecture for identification of the six-phase pulse compression sequences. Integrating this architecture with the currently proposing architecture provides an efficient real time hardware solution for identification and generation of the Six phase pulse compression sequences. This paper describes the generation of the Sixphase Pulse compression sequences using field programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed VLSI architecture is implemented on the FPGA as it provides the flexibility of reconfigurability and reprogrammability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4624983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10205730","htmlLink":"/document/4624983/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Generation of Six Phase Pulse Compression Sequences using FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of Six Phase Pulse Compression Sequences using FPGA","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3308a829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059693S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4624812","isNumber":"4624813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624812","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4624813","articleId":"4624983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4624993,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Liye","affiliation":["School of instrument science and engineering, South-East University, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Liye","id":"37689532300"},{"name":"Li Hongsheng","affiliation":["School of instrument science and engineering, South-East University, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Hongsheng","id":"38241844400"},{"name":"Zhou Bailing","affiliation":["School of instrument science and engineering, South-East University, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Bailing","id":"37689539200"},{"name":"Li Kunyu","affiliation":["School of instrument science and engineering, South-East University, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Kunyu","id":"37689533300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3308-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4624993","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"abstract":"Based on the strong robust performance of filter for the uncertainty of the system model and noises, a new method based on filter and Kalman inverse filter for gravity anomaly distortion correction is proposed to ameliorate the performance of single inverse Kalman filter.

The procedure has three main tasks: estimation of channel model parameters (CMPs), channel equalization, and decoding. These tasks are performed cyclicly until the algorithm converges. Information bits are convolutionally encoded, punctured and permuted, mapped into quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) symbols, linearly modulated, and transmitted through a downward-refracting ocean waveguide. Training symbols are prepended to the transmitted sequence for initial estimation of CMPs. Our algorithm processes data from a single receive sensor. Data are received on a vertical array and the performance of the algorithm for each sensor in the array is examined. There is negligible Doppler spread in the received data. However, difference between transmitter and receiver clocks as well as slight motion of the receive array produce a nonnegligible compression of the received signals. Consequently, there is observable Doppler ldquoshift.rdquo Nonuniform resampling of the data produces time series we model as the output of a linear time-invariant system. Resampling and CMP estimation are done iteratively, in conjunction with equalization and decoding. The algorithm successfully processes the data to yield few or no information bit errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Equalization and Decoding Approach for Underwater Acoustic Communication","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2008.923552","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4663184/04625214.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2008.923552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Equalization and Decoding Approach for Underwater Acoustic Communication","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10301416","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Equalization and Decoding Approach for Underwater Acoustic Communication","sourcePdf":"33joe02-sifferlen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070981S","chronDate":"April  2008","isNumber":"4663184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4625214","onlineDate":"12 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4625217,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew R.

The effectiveness of the work lies in considering the dynamic behavior of the local and the global best particle positions, which usually are treated as constant in the existing analysis. The behavior of an individual particle here is modeled as a closed loop control system, represented by a signal flow graph. The stability analysis of the closed loop system is undertaken using Jury's test and root locus technique of classical control theory, and the result obtained from the analysis offers a more stringent condition on parameter selection in comparison to the existing results on stability analysis.

A comparison of such methods is performed, by illustrating and discussing numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/EMS.2008.56","startPage":"34","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"2008 Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2008.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625228","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625227/4625228/04625243.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Parameters Optimisation for an Industrial Application: A Comparison between Traditional Approaches and Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625243/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Model Parameters Optimisation for an Industrial Application: A Comparison between Traditional Approaches and Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625243/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10207575","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Parameters Optimisation for an Industrial Application: A Comparison between Traditional Approaches and Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"3325a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044358S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625227","isNumber":"4625228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625227","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4625228","articleId":"4625243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4625248,"authors":[{"name":"Sanchita Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of ETCE, Jadavpur University, India"],"firstName":"Sanchita","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37690394400"},{"name":"Amit Konar","affiliation":["Liverpool Hope University, UK"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Konar","id":"37299656200"},{"name":"Atulya Nagar","affiliation":["Birla Institute of Technology, India"],"firstName":"Atulya","lastName":"Nagar","id":"37297391500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3325-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4625248","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625248","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Particle swarm optimization","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Mobile communication","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","genetic algorithms","mobile communication","particle swarm optimisation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel assignment","mobile networks","particle swarm optimization","frequency spectrum","cellular communication services","NP complete optimization problem","neural network","simulated annealing","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile cellular network","Channel assignment problem","Hard and soft constraints","Allocation matrix","Fitness function","Particle swarm optimization","Call rejection probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMS.2008.63","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625227/4625228/04625248.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2008.63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Channel Assignment Problem in Mobile Networks Using Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"The problem of optimal channel assignment has become increasingly important because of available frequency spectrum and increasing demand for cellular communication services.

Proper use of a counter-based scheme can reduce the number of rebroadcasts and hence reduce the chance of contention and collision among neighbouring nodes. While most previous studies have used a fixed counter-based threshold value irrespective of node/network status, this research argues that one-hop neighbourhood information could be used to dynamically estimate more suitable threshold values of the traditional counter based at a given node. This is done based on locally available information and without requiring any assistance of distance measurements or exact location determination devices. Our simulation results show that the new dynamic scheme provides good performance levels compared to the existing solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold Analysis of Adjusted Counter-Based Broadcast in MANETs","publicationTitle":"2008 Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation","doi":"10.1109/EMS.2008.35","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625227/4625228/04625324.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2008.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Threshold Analysis of Adjusted Counter-Based Broadcast in MANETs","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625324/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10207606","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold Analysis of Adjusted Counter-Based Broadcast in MANETs","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"3325a500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078135S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625227","isNumber":"4625228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625227","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4625228","articleId":"4625324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625398,"authors":[{"name":"Carmen C.Y.

In this article, we review BCI systems based on visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Although the performance of this type of BCI has already been evaluated by many research groups through a variety of laboratory demonstrations, researchers are still facing many difficulties in changing the demonstrations to practically applicable systems. On the basis of the literature, we describe the challenges in developing practical BCI systems. Also, our recent work in the designs and implementations of the BCI systems based on steady-state VEPs (SSVEPs) is described in detail. The results show that by adequately considering the problems encountered in system design, signal processing, and parameter optimization, SSVEPs can provide the most useful information about brain activities using the least number of electrodes. At the same time, system cost could be greatly decreased and usability could be readily improved, thus benefiting the implementation of a practical BCI.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain-Computer Interfaces Based on Visual Evoked Potentials","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MEMB.2008.923958","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/51/4625383/04625401.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMB.2008.923958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625401/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September-October  2008","displayDocTitle":"Brain-Computer Interfaces Based on Visual Evoked Potentials","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4625401/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"September-October 2008","accessionNumber":"10208436","pubMedId":"18799392","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain-Computer Interfaces Based on Visual Evoked Potentials","sourcePdf":"18_27memb05-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087062S","chronDate":"September-October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"51","isNumber":"4625383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"231","xplore-issue":"4625383","articleId":"4625401","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4625437,"authors":[{"name":"Yi He","affiliation":["Computer School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Yi He","id":"37398854100"},{"name":"Ju Ren","affiliation":["Computer School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Ju Ren","id":"37288702000"},{"name":"Qianming Yang","affiliation":["Computer School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Qianming Yang","id":"37690924900"},{"name":"Mei Wen","affiliation":["Computer School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Mei Wen","id":"37409755400"},{"name":"Nan Wu","affiliation":["Computer School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Nan Wu","id":"37394845700"},{"name":"Chunyuan Zhang","affiliation":["Computer School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Chunyuan Zhang","id":"37288985700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2682-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2683-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4625437","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"abstract":"Stream architecture research is often hindered by slow software simulations.

This paper proposed FPGA-based equivalent simulation technology (FEST) and constructs an Equivalent model called FEST model based on it. FEST can support cluster-scalable simulation for clustered stream architecture well by replace some components by a simpler structure with equivalent function. The simulator based on FEST model (1) needs fewer FPGA resource than the original system but has little influence on simulation speed, (2) is accurate to cycle level resolution, (3) can run unmodified applications, (4) can reappear simulation results including resource consuming and timing analysis of original system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610266/4625425/04625437.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","doi":"10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based Equivalent Simulation Technology (FEST) for clustered stream architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Timing","Program processors","Bandwidth","Analytical models","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based equivalent simulation technology","clustered stream architecture","software simulations","cluster-scalable simulation","timing analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based Equivalent Simulation Technology (FEST) for clustered stream architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625437/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220658","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based Equivalent Simulation Technology (FEST) for clustered stream architecture","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"40_paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064412S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610266","isNumber":"4625425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610266","xplore-issue":"4625425","articleId":"4625437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625444,"authors":[{"name":"Anderson Kuei-An Ku","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Anderson Kuei-An","lastName":"Ku","id":"37660529600"},{"name":"Jenny Yi-Chun Kuo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jenny Yi-Chun","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37652970800"},{"name":"Jingling Xue","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Jingling Xue","id":"37402346100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2682-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2683-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4625444","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"The increase of operating frequency of microprocessors has begun to meet more obstacles. Performance of single-thread applications no longer benefits from running under a faster processor. As a result, the performance increase has to come from additional hardware support which makes use of the large number of transistors available. This paper presents a novel hardware support called distTree to speed up processor performance. The distTree hardware automates gather and scatter operations for applications with complex but predictable memory access patterns like the fast Fourier transform (FFT). With this hardware support integrated with a modern microprocessor like Alpha, the FFT performance can reap an increase of over 100% when compared against the FFTW library, a state-of-the-art implementation. The distTree hardware support enables the processor to spend the majority of processor cycles on executing the computation operations of an algorithm by reducing both the arithmetic and address computation overhead. Therefore, the performance of many single-thread applications can be significantly increased.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610266/4625425/04625444.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","doi":"10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A gather/scatter hardware support for efficient Fast Fourier Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation detectors","Pediatrics","Hardware","Computer architecture","Fast Fourier transforms","Registers","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gather hardware support","scatter hardware support","fast Fourier transform","operating frequency","microprocessors","single-thread applications","distTree hardware","memory access patterns","Alpha"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A gather/scatter hardware support for efficient Fast Fourier Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625444/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10207501","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A gather/scatter hardware support for efficient Fast Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"61_paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060711S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610266","isNumber":"4625425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610266","xplore-issue":"4625425","articleId":"4625444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625448,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Yi","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kang Yi","id":"37437831200"},{"name":"Shih-Yang Cheng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Handong Global University, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Shih-Yang Cheng","id":"37692873300"},{"name":"Fadi Kurdahi","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fadi","lastName":"Kurdahi","id":"37267909800"},{"name":"Ahmed Eltawil","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Eltawil","id":"37266114500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2682-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2683-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4625448","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Memory management","Bit error rate","PSNR","Decoding","Pixel","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated memory circuits","multimedia computing","system-on-chip","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial memory protection scheme","SoC","on-chip embedded memory","silicon real estate","very deep submicron","video data memory system architecture design","multimedia data","H.264"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625448","abstract":"With the emerging SoC era the on-chip embedded memory will occupy most of the silicon real estate. As the technology proceeds into very deep submicron, the yield of SoCs will drop sharply mainly because of the on-chip memory failure. Therefore, the embedded memory is becoming the crucial part for achieving higher chip yield. In this paper, we propose an error-resilient video data memory system architecture design. The proposed scheme employs partial memory protection scheme rather than traditional whole memory protection. Our approach is based on the fact that video data memory need not to be error-free because multimedia data has built-in redundancies by their own nature and allows partial data loss without serious quality degradation. With our approach we can achieve 100% data memory yield while incurring a small power overhead. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach with H.264 application up to 2.0% memory bit error.","doi":"10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625448","publicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610266/4625425/04625448.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A partial memory protection scheme for higher effective yield of embedded memory for video data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A partial memory protection scheme for higher effective yield of embedded memory for video data","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625448/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10207502","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A partial memory protection scheme for higher effective yield of embedded memory for video data","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"69_paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071555S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610266","isNumber":"4625425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610266","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4625425","articleId":"4625448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625475,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Microprocessor and SoC Tech.

But current regular expression matching algorithms or architecture cannot provide a perfect solution for whole matching problem. In some real network security applications, exact strings are the biggest part of rule set, and the second part is simple regular expressions (dot-star and AND-logic), and the other complex regular expressions only occupy a very small part. So, we propose a new hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture, called MSRM, for Dot-Star and AND-logic regular expressions. Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly. Experiments with random test data and ClamAV rule set show that MSRM can achieve a high throughput of 2.1 and 2.8 Gbps using Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively which is much higher than software algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610266/4625425/04625475.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","doi":"10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiple simple regular expression matching architecture and coprocessor for deep packet inspection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern matching","Random access memory","Computer architecture","Doped fiber amplifiers","Hardware","Security","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","coprocessors","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet inspection coprocessor","pattern matching","content inspection","AND-logic","hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture","RAM data","dot-star","AND-logic regular expressions","Virtex2 devices","Virtex4 devices","software algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A multiple simple regular expression matching architecture and coprocessor for deep packet inspection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625475/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220685","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiple simple regular expression matching architecture and coprocessor for deep packet inspection","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"71_paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072243S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610266","isNumber":"4625425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610266","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4625425","articleId":"4625475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625477,"authors":[{"name":"San-Chih Lin","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"San-Chih Lin","id":"37087656612"},{"name":"Chi-Kuang Chang","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Kuang Chang","id":"37087657904"},{"name":"Nai-Wei Lin","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Nai-Wei Lin","id":"37087658638"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2682-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2683-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4625477","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625477","abstract":"Compilers usually provide a large number of optimization options for users to fine tune the performance of their programs. However, most users don\u2019t have the capability to select suitable optimization options. Compilers hence usually provide a number of optimization levels. Each optimization level is a pre-selected group of optimization options and produces good efficiency for most programs. However, they exploit only a portion of the available optimization options. There is still a large potential that an even better efficiency can be gained for each specific source code by exploiting the rest of the available optimization options. We propose a gene weighted genetic algorithm to search for optimization options better than optimization levels for each specific source code. We also show that this new genetic algorithm is more effective than the basic genetic algorithm for a set of benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625477","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4610266/4625425/04625477.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic selection of GCC optimization options using a gene weighted genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Evolution (biology)","Organisms","Benchmark testing","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic selection","GCC optimization","gene weighted genetic algorithm","program compilers","optimization options","optimization level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic selection of GCC optimization options using a gene weighted genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625477/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220687","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic selection of GCC optimization options using a gene weighted genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"83_paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040783S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4610266","isNumber":"4625425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4610266","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4625425","articleId":"4625477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4625496,"authors":[{"name":"Verena Tunnicliffe","affiliation":["VENUS Project, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Verena","lastName":"Tunnicliffe","id":"37697670200"},{"name":"Chris R.

It is a cooperative scheme which allows nearby sectors of two adjacent cells to dynamically change their coverage to meet the optimal transmission rates allocation for their mobile users.

In this paper, we are interested in analyzing sharing between three classes of services: real-time (RT), non-real-time (NRT) and best-effort (BE). A classical approach which is widely used in wireless networks is based on adaptively deciding how many channels to allocate to calls of a given class. The rational behind our idea is that the NRT class (e.g. FTP) requires a minimum transmission rate. The capacity allocated to NRT traffic includes a fixed portion of bandwidth as well as a dynamic part which is shared with RT service. In contrast, BE applications can adapt their transmission rate to the networkpsilas available resources. Hence, the best-effort applications can use only the unused resources of the NRT band. Using a spectral analysis approach, we compute the steady-state distribution of the calls number for those different classes which allows us to provide explicitly the performance measure. The QoS parameters of interest are primarily the blocking probability for both RT calls and NRT calls, and expected sojourn times for both NRT calls and BE calls. We finally provide numerical study to show the benefit of our capacity allocation method by providing a desired quality level of service for NRT services, and we propose some CAC policies for NRT and BE services.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625630","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607772/4625572/04625630.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink call admission control in multi-services W-CDMA network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625630/","displayDocTitle":"Uplink call admission control in multi-services W-CDMA network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10220525","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625630/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink call admission control in multi-services W-CDMA network","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1569095577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079729S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607772","isNumber":"4625572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607772","xplore-issue":"4625572","articleId":"4625630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625651,"authors":[{"name":"Samira Mabtoul","affiliation":["LRIT-GSCM, University Mohamed V Rabat, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Samira","lastName":"Mabtoul","id":"37696181400"},{"name":"El Hassan Ibn Elhaj","affiliation":["LRIT-GSCM, University Mohamed V, Rabat, Morocco","Institut National des Postes et Telecommunications (INPT), Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"El Hassan","lastName":"Ibn Elhaj","id":"37586007600"},{"name":"Driss Aboutajdine","affiliation":["LRIT-GSCM, University Mohamed V, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Driss","lastName":"Aboutajdine","id":"37085489167"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2702-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2703-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"4625651","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Wavelet transforms","Transforms","Robustness","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image reconstruction","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trees (mathematics)","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust digital image watermarking method","dual tree complex wavelet transform","location matrix"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a robust watermarking scheme based on Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) is proposed.

Similar to generic wireless sensor networks that collect information from surrounding physical environments as scalar variables, wireless image sensor networks can collect data to generate descriptions of interested targets as images or video streams that, in turn, enhance the userpsilas understanding. However, relaying images over wireless image sensor networks with certain QoS requirements is a challenging task due to the characteristics of wireless channels. In this paper, a novel transport protocol for wireless image sensor networks is presented. This protocol aims at the reliable and synchronous transmission of images from multiple sensor nodes to a sync point. The semantics of JPEG stream are exploited in order to improve the performance of the proposed protocol. We have conducted a series of simulation experiments and reported on their results. Our simulation results show that the proposed protocol performs well in error-prone wireless channels even under high packet loss rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607772/4625572/04625679.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1089","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reliable synchronous transport protocol for wireless image sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Synchronization","Transform coding","Image coding","Receivers","Wireless communication","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","quality of service","synchronisation","telecommunication network reliability","transport protocols","video streaming","visual communication","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous transport protocol reliability","wireless image sensor networks","image sensing hardware","video streams","images streams","QoS requirements","synchronous transmission","JPEG stream","error-prone wireless channels","high packet loss rates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synchronization","Image transmission","Wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A reliable synchronous transport protocol for wireless image sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625679/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10220568","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reliable synchronous transport protocol for wireless image sensor networks","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1569095999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070628S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607772","isNumber":"4625572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607772","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4625572","articleId":"4625679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625690,"authors":[{"name":"Samad S.

We consider the MIMO extraction based on the maximization of a contrast function. A new self-styled referenced contrast (RC) function is proposed, which is based on cross-trispectra between the estimated output and a reference signal. Using Parsevals formula, the former criterion yields a new class of time-domain contrast. It presents two main advantages over other more traditional contrasts. Firstly, it concerns the computational cost, and secondly the extension takes into consideration the extraction of the independent sources in the presence of Gaussian sources by making some constraints on the reference signals. There is no comparison with other methods because this is the first technique that deals with this kind of signals in the convolutif mixtures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind MIMO deconvolution of any source distributions via high-order spectra","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625691","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607772/4625572/04625691.pdf","startPage":"818","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind MIMO deconvolution of any source distributions via high-order spectra","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625691/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10220579","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind MIMO deconvolution of any source distributions via high-order spectra","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1569097379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050567S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607772","isNumber":"4625572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607772","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4625572","articleId":"4625691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4625692,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The main novelty of the approach is the judicious combination of two methods so as to reduce the bandwidth overhead and computational complexity without compromising the estimation range. The cyclic prefix (CP) associated with the OFDM symbols are used for the fractional frequency offset estimation. The integer frequency offset is estimated by means of a cost function minimization employing a few null subcarriers, which are allocated using a modified Fibonacci series. Performance of the frequency offset estimator is mathematically analyzed by deriving the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and is compared with the mean square error performance of the estimator. For moderate SNRs, our algorithm is shown to outperform some existing methods in terms of MSE (and thereby BER) performance, training overhead and receiver complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient maximum likelihood carrier frequency offset estimation technique for OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625692","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607772/4625572/04625692.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An efficient maximum likelihood carrier frequency offset estimation technique for OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625692/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10207485","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient maximum likelihood carrier frequency offset estimation technique for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1569097533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057847S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607772","isNumber":"4625572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607772","xplore-issue":"4625572","articleId":"4625692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4625699,"authors":[{"name":"Binbin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, BeiJing Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Binbin Xu","id":"37673480000"},{"name":"Jianping An","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, BeiJing Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Jianping An","id":"37286060500"},{"name":"Zhongxia He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, BeiJing Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Zhongxia He","id":"37694278900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2702-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2703-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"4625699","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Complexity theory","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Detectors","Artificial neural networks","Convergence","Immune system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels","Hopfield neural nets","multiuser detection","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MC-CDMA multiuser detection","hybrid immune clonal selection algorithm","hopfield neural network","fading channels","multicarrier code division multiple access communications systems","bit error rate performance","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present multiuser detection (MUD) technique based on a hybrid immune clonal selection algorithm (ICSA) with Hopfield neural network (HNN), for multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) communications systems.

The performances of the ICSA with different parameters are studied, and the effect of parameter changing is analyzed, however adjusting these parameters cannot significantly accelerate the convergence. Then, Hopfield Neural Networks are embedded into the ICSA to improve further the affinity of the antibodies at each generation.

The results showed that co-channel femto cells offer considerable gains from both user and network perspective with all receivers even if the femto cell users are not concentrated near the femto base stations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607772/4625572/04625701.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"843","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity improvement by employing femto cells in a macro cell HSDPA network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Load modeling","Buildings","Throughput","Bit rate","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity improvement","femto cells","macro cell HSDPA network","very low transmission power base stations","close proximity","dynamic system level simulations","linear minimum mean squared error equalizer receivers","mobile terminals","co-channel femto cells"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity improvement by employing femto cells in a macro cell HSDPA network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625701/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10220586","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity improvement by employing femto cells in a macro cell HSDPA network","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1569098502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06955S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607772","isNumber":"4625572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607772","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4625572","articleId":"4625701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4625716,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Yun Hsieh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hung-Yun Hsieh","id":"37087146696"},{"name":"Hsiao-Pu Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsiao-Pu Lin","id":"37087290723"},{"name":"You-En Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"You-En Lin","id":"37087290991"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2702-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2703-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"4625716","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":136},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a university campus that has an established infrastructure for supporting SIP-based VoIP service through the campus wireless data network. The campus WLAN, however, does not have 100% full coverage, and hence users cannot make untethered VoIP calls anywhere on campus. The goal of this paper is to overcome the limitations of such WLAN dead spots and improve user experience when making VoIP calls. Different from related work that relies on peer-to-peer communication for multi-hop relay, we propose an approach called ldquodual-mode communicationrdquo to leverage the availability of dual-mode handsets for ubiquitous communication on campus. We implement the proposed approach and evaluate its performance in the campus testbed environment. We find that an opportunistic usage of dual communication modes on mobile handsets does allow ubiquitous voice communication in WLAN dead spots. However, it has one problem as the potential lack of voice call continuity during hand-off between the two modes that can cause degradation of the speech quality. We adopt a cross-layer solution based on signal processing algorithms to address the problem, thus achieving seamless voice call continuity while enabling ubiquitous voice communication on campus. Testbed evaluations show promising results for future research along the proposed direction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","GSM","Telephone sets","Telephony","Mobile communication","Delay","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet telephony","mobile handsets","ubiquitous computing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["campus VoIP service","ubiquitous communication","dual-mode mobile handsets","campus wireless data network","campus WLAN","opportunistic dual communication","cross-layer solution","signal processing algorithms","seamless voice call continuity","ubiquitous voice communication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625716","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607772/4625572/04625716.pdf","startPage":"1159","endPage":"1165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing campus VoIP service for ubiquitous communication on dual-mode mobile handsets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing campus VoIP service for ubiquitous communication on dual-mode mobile handsets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625716/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625716/","accessionNumber":"10220598","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing campus VoIP service for ubiquitous communication on dual-mode mobile handsets","confLoc":"Marrakech","sourcePdf":"1569099089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04531S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607772","isNumber":"4625572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607772","xplore-issue":"4625572","articleId":"4625716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4625717,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Yasami","affiliation":["Young Researcher Club, Arak Azad University, Arak, Markazi, Iran"],"lastName":"Yasser Yasami","id":"37696883200"},{"name":"Siavash Khorsandi","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Siavash","lastName":"Khorsandi","id":"37270213700"},{"name":"Saadat Pour Mozaffari","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saadat Pour","lastName":"Mozaffari","id":"37530788600"},{"name":"Arash Jalalian","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Jalalian","id":"37702277400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2702-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2703-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"4625717","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel method to combine k-means clustering and ID3 decision trees learning algorithms for unsupervised classification of anomalous and normal activities in computer network ARP traffic. The k-means clustering method is first applied to the normal training instances to partition it into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. Some anomaly criteria has been defined and applied to the captured ARP traffic to generate normal training instances. An ID3 decision tree is constructed on each cluster. Anomaly scores from the k-means clustering algorithm and decisions of the ID3 decision trees are extracted. A special algorithm is used to combine results of the two algorithms and obtain final anomaly score values. The threshold rule is applied for making decision on the test instance normality or abnormality. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has a high precision, sensitivity and performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4607772/4625572/04625717.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"403","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unsupervised network anomaly detection approach by k-Means clustering & ID3 algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Decision trees","Training","Classification algorithms","Distance measurement","Partitioning algorithms","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","decision making","decision trees","pattern classification","pattern clustering","protocols","security of data","telecommunication traffic","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised network anomaly detection approach","k-means clustering","ID3 decision trees learning algorithms","unsupervised classification","anomalous activities","normal activities","computer network","Euclidean distance similarity","decision making","address resolution protocol traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection System (ADS)","Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)","Unsupervised Classification","K-Means Clustering","ID3 Decision Trees"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An unsupervised network anomaly detection approach by k-Means clustering & ID3 algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625717/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10220599","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unsupervised network anomaly detection approach by k-Means clustering & ID3 algorithms","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1569099095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050724S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4607772","isNumber":"4625572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4607772","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4625572","articleId":"4625717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4625802,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yun Zhou [S] (yzufl@ufl.edu) received a B.E. degree in electronic information engineering (2000) and an M.E. degree in communication and information systems (2003) from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science at the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.

Finally, we conclude with suggestions for a general architecture that can form the basis for a practical VANET.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625806/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2008","publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625806/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235323","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Ad Hoc networks: applications and related technical issues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Ad Hoc networks: applications and related technical issues","sourcePdf":"7MUHLETHALER.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107072S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"4625798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"421","xplore-issue":"4625798","articleId":"4625806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4625829,"authors":[{"name":"Kyriakos Stavrou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Kyriakos","lastName":"Stavrou","id":"37299138300"},{"name":"Marios Nikolaides","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Nikolaides","id":"37701628300"},{"name":"Demos Pavlou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Demos","lastName":"Pavlou","id":"37696869100"},{"name":"Samer Arandi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Samer","lastName":"Arandi","id":"37596026100"},{"name":"Paraskevas Evripidou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Paraskevas","lastName":"Evripidou","id":"37267723000"},{"name":"Pedro Trancoso","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Trancoso","id":"37267116100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3374-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"4625829","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625829","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Runtime","Hardware","Software","Multithreading","Program processors","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","multi-threading","operating systems (computers)","parallel processing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portable platform","data-driven multithreading","commodity multicore systems","thread flux","operating system","thread scheduling","thread synchronization unit","Simics-based multicore system","TSU hardware module","TFluxHard","TFluxSoft","TFluxCell"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TFlux","Multicores","Virtualization","Programmability","Parallel Execution Models"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present thread flux (TFlux), a complete system that supports the data-driven multithreading (DDM) model of execution. TFlux virtualizes any details of the underlying system therefore offering the same programming model independently of the architecture. To achieve this goal, TFlux has a runtime support that is built on top of a commodity operating system. Scheduling of threads is performed by the thread synchronization unit (TSU), which can be implemented either as a hardware or a software module. In addition, TFlux includes a preprocessor that, along with a set of simple compiler directives, allows the user to easily develop DDM programs. The preprocessor then automatically produces the TFlux code, which can be compiled using any commodity C compiler, therefore automatically producing code to any ISA. TFlux has been validated on three platforms. A Simics-based multicore system with a TSU hardware module (TFluxHard), a commodity 8-core Intel Core2 QuadCore-based system with a software TSU module (TFluxSoft), and a Cell/BE system with a software TSU module (TFluxCell). The experimental results show that the performance achieved is close to linear speedup, on average 21x for the 27 nodes TFluxHard, and 4.4x on a 6 nodes TFluxSoft and TFluxCell. Most importantly, the observed speedup is stable across the different platforms thus allowing the benefits of DDM to be exploited on different commodity systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2008.74","publicationTitle":"2008 37th International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 37th International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625814/4625815/04625829.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2008.74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TFlux: A Portable Platform for Data-Driven Multithreading on Commodity Multicore Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"TFlux: A Portable Platform for Data-Driven Multithreading on Commodity Multicore Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4625829/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220776","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625829/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TFlux: A Portable Platform for Data-Driven Multithreading on Commodity Multicore Systems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"3374a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078786S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625814","isNumber":"4625815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625814","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4625815","articleId":"4625829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625843,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00f6rg D\u00fcmmler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"D\u00fcmmler","id":"37697688600"},{"name":"Thomas Rauber","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany","Angewandte Informatik II, Bayreuth University"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Rauber","id":"37281781200"},{"name":"Gudula R\u00fcnger","affiliation":["Angewandte Informatik II, Bayreuth University, Germany","Department of Computer Science, Chemnitz University of Technology"],"firstName":"Gudula","lastName":"R\u00fcnger","id":"37281780700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3374-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"4625843","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic cores","Program processors","Benchmark testing","Parallel processing","Programming","Mathematical model","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mapping algorithm","multiprocessor task","multicore cluster system","interconnection network","M-task program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scalability","Multi-core systems","mixed task and data parallelism"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we explore the use of hierarchically structured multiprocessor tasks (M-tasks) for programming multi-core cluster systems.These systems often have hierarchically structured interconnection networks combining different computing resources, starting with the interconnect within multi-core processors up to the interconnection network combining nodes of the cluster or supercomputer.

We have shown how we can use the notion of subgraph isomorphism and developed an effective resource allocation algorithm. The main observations from the experiments we conducted to evaluate our algorithms were as follows: the overhead caused by our algorithm is comparable to an existing algorithm, Streamline, which is based onheuristics. At the same time, the application performance was improved by 30% on average. When compared to the allocation performed by the optimal algorithm, which enumerates all mappings, the application performance with our algorithm was within 4%. At the same time, unlike the optimal algorithm, our algorithm scaled well to large graphs.","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2008.49","publicationTitle":"2008 37th International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 37th International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625814/4625815/04625876.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2008.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Distributed Streaming Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Distributed Streaming Applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10220809","htmlLink":"/document/4625876/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Distributed Streaming Applications","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"3374a414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103107S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625814","isNumber":"4625815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625814","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4625815","articleId":"4625876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4625887,"authors":[{"name":"Aydin Buluc","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Aydin","lastName":"Buluc","id":"37064569200"},{"name":"John R.

States of a cell change due to mutual interactions of either electrostatic or magnetic fields. Due to their small sizes, power is an important design parameter. In this paper, we derive an upper bound for power loss that will occur with input change, even with the circuit staying at respective ground states before and after the change. This bound is computationally efficient to compute for large QCA circuits since it just requires the knowledge of the before and after ground states due to input change. We categorize power loss in clocked QCA circuits into two types that are commonly used in circuit theory: switching power and leakage power. Leakage power loss is independent of input states and occurs when the clock energy is raised or lowered to depolarize or polarize a cell. Switching power is dependent on input combinations and occurs at the instant when the cell actually changes state. Total power loss is controlled by changing the rate of change of transitions in the clocking function. Our model provides an estimate of power loss in a QCA circuit for clocks with sharp transitions, which result in nonadiabatic operations and gives us the upper bound of power expended. We derive expressions for upper bounds of switching and leakage power that are easy to compute. Upper bounds obviously are pessimistic estimates, but are necessary to design robust circuits, leaving room for operational manufacturing variability. Given that thermal issues are critical to QCA designs, we show how our model can be valuable for QCA design automation in multiple ways. It can be used to quickly locate potential thermal hot spots in a QCA circuit. The model can also be used to correlate power loss with different input vector switching; power loss is dependent on the input vector. We can study the tradeoff between switching and leakage power in QCA circuits. And, we can use the model to vet different designs of the same logic, which we demonstrate for the full adder.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Upper Bound of Power Dissipation in QCA Circuits","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2008.2005408","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/4757441/04625949.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2008.2005408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625949/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Upper Bound of Power Dissipation in QCA Circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4625949/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10401541","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Upper Bound of Power Dissipation in QCA Circuits","sourcePdf":"tnano-bhanja-2005408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07516S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"4757441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4757441","articleId":"4625949","onlineDate":"16 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4625963,"authors":[{"name":"Adiwinata Gani","affiliation":["Bioinformatics Cell, Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4808337/4625963/4625963-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adiwinata Gani received the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2002, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Bioinformatics Cell, Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, Fort Detrick, MD.

However, from a modeling perspective, before the benefits of such a strategy can be attained, we must first be able to quantitatively characterize the behavior of the model coefficients as well as the model predictions as a function of prediction horizon. We need to determine if the model coefficients reflect viable physiologic dependencies of the individual glycemic measurements and whether the model is stable with respect to small changes in noise levels, leading to accurate near-future predictions with negligible time lag. We assessed the behavior of linear autoregressive data-driven models developed under three possible modeling scenarios, using continuous glucose measurements of nine subjects collected on a minute-by-minute basis for approximately 5 days. Simulation results indicated that stable and accurate models for near-future glycemic predictions (<60 min) with clinically acceptable time lags are attained only when the raw glucose measurements are smoothed and the model coefficients are regularized. This study provides a starting point for further needed investigations before real-time deployment can be considered.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration in Humans: Data-Driven Glucose Modeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.2005937","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4808337/04625963.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.2005937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625963/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration in Humans: Data-Driven Glucose Modeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4625963/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10547471","pubMedId":"19272928","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration in Humans: Data-Driven Glucose Modeling","sourcePdf":"tbme-gribok-2005937.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060236S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4808337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4808337","articleId":"4625963","onlineDate":"16 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4625979,"authors":[{"name":"Yanwei Pang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Systems, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yanwei","lastName":"Pang","id":"37416619900"},{"name":"Yuan Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37401230700"},{"name":"Xuelong Li","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Xuelong","lastName":"Li","id":"37293192200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4625979","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> This correspondence first kernalizes the region covariance matrix and formalizes the similarity metric using four block matrices.

To this end, the head pose observations are modeled using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) or a hidden Markov model (HMM) whose hidden states correspond to the VFOA. The novelties of this paper are threefold. First, contrary to previous studies on the topic, in our setup, the potential VFOA of a person is not restricted to other participants only. It includes environmental targets as well (a table and a projection screen), which increases the complexity of the task, with more VFOA targets spread in the pan as well as tilt gaze space. Second, we propose a geometric model to set the GMM or HMM parameters by exploiting results from cognitive science on saccadic eye motion, which allows the prediction of the head pose given a gaze target. Third, an unsupervised parameter adaptation step not using any labeled data is proposed, which accounts for the specific gazing behavior of each participant. Using a publicly available corpus of eight meetings featuring four persons, we analyze the above methods by evaluating, through objective performance measures, the recognition of the VFOA from head pose information obtained either using a magnetic sensor device or a vision-based tracking system. The results clearly show that in such complex but realistic situations, the VFOA recognition performance is highly dependent on how well the visual targets are separated for a given meeting participant. In addition, the results show that the use of a geometric model with unsupervised adaptation achieves better results than the use of training data to set the HMM parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.927274","startPage":"16","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.927274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749414","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4749414/04625982.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognizing Visual Focus of Attention From Head Pose in Natural Meetings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625982/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recognizing Visual Focus of Attention From Head Pose in Natural Meetings","volume":"39","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4625982/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10391595","pubMedId":"19068430","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing Visual Focus of Attention From Head Pose in Natural Meetings","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-ba-927274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162899S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4749414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"4749414","articleId":"4625982","onlineDate":"16 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4625983,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Brdiczka","affiliation":["Palo Alto Research Center, Inc.orporated, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4749414/4625983/4625983-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oliver Brdiczka received the diploma degree in computer science from the University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, the engineer's degree from the Ecole National Sup\u00e9rieure d'Informatique et de Math\u00e9matiques Appliqu\u00e9s, Grenoble, France, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG).

The optimal transconductance and gain of the pre-amplifiers, which minimizes the power-area product of the amplifier, are mathematically derived.

A tradeoff between the power consumption of the system and the chip area in terms of the multiplexing ratio is investigated and the optimal number of channels per ADC is selected to achieve the minimum power-area product for the entire system.

Excessive bit-line leakage current results in slower read operations or even functional failure. In this paper, we present a new technique, called X-calibration, to combat this phenomenon. Unlike the previous method that attempts to compensate the leakage current directly, this scheme first transforms the bit-line leakage current into an equilibrium offset voltage across the bit-line pair, and then simple circuitry is utilized to cancel this offset accurately at the input of the sense amplifier so that the sensing is not affected by the bit-line leakage. SPICE simulation of a 1 Kbit SRAM macro shows that this X-calibration scheme can handle 83% higher bit-line leakage current than the previous bit-line leakage compensation scheme. Measurement results of the test chip show that the SRAM macro adopting X-calibration scheme can cope with up to 320 muA bit-line leakage current.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","volume":"43","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10222337","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4625995/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"X-Calibration: A Technique for Combating Excessive Bitline Leakage Current in Nanometer SRAM Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X-Calibration: A Technique for Combating Excessive Bitline Leakage Current in Nanometer SRAM Designs","sourcePdf":"jssc-lai-2001937.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073992S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4625985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4625985","articleId":"4625995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4625996,"authors":[{"name":"Oleksiy Tyshchenko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4625985/4625996/4625996-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oleksiy Tyshchenko received the B.A.Sc. degree (with honors) in electrical engineering from the Division of Engineering Science in 2004 and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering in 2006, both from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

However, in such a system, the power signal interferes with the data transmission due to the multiple magnetic couplings paths within the inductive coils. Since the power level of the transmitted power signal is significantly larger than that of the data signal, it usually requires a high-order filter to suppress the interference. This paper presents a non-coherent DPSK receiver without a high-order filter that is robust to the interference caused by the power carrier signal. The proposed scheme uses differential demodulation in the analog domain to cancel the interference signal for a dual-band configuration. The data demodulation also uses subsampling to avoid carrier synchronization circuits such as PLLs. The experimental results show that the demodulator can recover 1 and 2 Mb/s data rates at a 20 MHz carrier frequency, and it is able to cancel an interference signal that is 12 dB larger than the data signal without using complex filters. The demodulator is fabricated in a 0.35 mum CMOS process, with a power consumption of 6.2 mW and an active die area of 2.6times1.7mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2001881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4625985/04625999.pdf","startPage":"2003","endPage":"2012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2001881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Non-Coherent DPSK Data Receiver With Interference Cancellation for Dual-Band Transcutaneous Telemetries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4625999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4625999/","displayDocTitle":"A Non-Coherent DPSK Data Receiver With Interference Cancellation for Dual-Band Transcutaneous Telemetries","volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222341","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4625999/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Non-Coherent DPSK Data Receiver With Interference Cancellation for Dual-Band Transcutaneous Telemetries","sourcePdf":"jssc-zhou-2001881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053479S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4625985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4625985","articleId":"4625999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626000,"authors":[{"name":"Supisa Lerstaveesin","affiliation":["Axiom Micro Devices, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA","Chrontel, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4625985/4626000/4626000-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Supisa Lerstaveesin (S'03) received the B.Eng. degree from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, in 2000, the M.S. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at San Diego in 2007.","She was a test engineer with Philips Semiconductor, Thailand, and was with Chrontel, San Diego, CA, as an analog design engineer. in 2007, she joined Qualcomm R&D Center, San Diego."]},"firstName":"Supisa","lastName":"Lerstaveesin","id":"37696767500"},{"name":"Manoj Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4625985/4626000/4626000-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Manoj Gupta received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, in 1998, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2000.","From 2000 to 2001, he was a software engineer at Siliconwave, San Diego, CA, and in 2001, he joined Wireless Interface Technology (later merged with Chrontel), San Diego, as a design engineer."]},"firstName":"Manoj","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37553273300"},{"name":"David Kang","affiliation":["Chrontel, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4625985/4626000/4626000-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["David Kang (M'91) received the B.S.E.E. degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1989 and the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1990.","From 1991 to 2000, he was with Motorola, Schaumburg, IL, where he designed CMOS integrated circuits for automotive applications. in 2000, he co-founded Wireless Interface Technologies (WIT), developing CMOS RF transceivers for Bluetooth and WLAN applications.

A novel low-voltage pulse-width modulator is proposed. The modulator can be directly powered from the 0.9-V input instead of using the 2.5-V output as in general modulator designs. Sophisticated low-voltage analog blocks, which normally consume a large amount of power and chip area, are not required in the modulator. The impact of output-voltage ripple and transient-induced output-voltage perturbation on the operation of analog blocks inside the modulator is eliminated. Boost converter start-up sequence is also greatly simplified. A CMOS-control rectifier (CCR) is also proposed to improve converter power efficiency. The CCR is used to replace the conventional rectifying switch to provide adaptive dead-time, which helps to minimize charge-sharing loss and body-diode conduction loss. Corresponding thermal stress on the rectifying switch is hence minimized. The CCR also enables the use of small off-chip inductor and capacitor at sub-MHz switching frequency to improve light-load efficiency. This converter has been implemented in a 0.35- mum CMOS process. It is designed to operate at ~ 667 kHz with a 1 mu H inductor and 4.7 mu F output capacitor to reduce both switching loss and form factor. Experimental results prove that the converter can be directly powered from 0.9-V input with ~ 85% efficiency at 100-mA output.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"2036","endPage":"2046","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2001933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2001933","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4625985/04626003.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.9-V Input Discontinuous-Conduction-Mode Boost Converter With CMOS-Control Rectifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626003/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 0.9-V Input Discontinuous-Conduction-Mode Boost Converter With CMOS-Control Rectifier","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222344","volume":"43","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4626003/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.9-V Input Discontinuous-Conduction-Mode Boost Converter With CMOS-Control Rectifier","sourcePdf":"43jssc09-pmok-2001933.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090289S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4625985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4625985","articleId":"4626003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4626005,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Carrara","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics s.r.l., Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4625985/4626005/4626005-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Carrara (S'01\u2013M'03) received the Laurea degree in electrical engineering (cum laude) and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and automation engineering from the University of Catania, Catania, Italy, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.","Since 1999, he has been with the Radio Frequency Advanced Design Center (RF-ADC), a joint research center supported by the University of Catania and STMicroelectronics, where he is now an Assistant Professor.

To this purpose, a closed-loop protection circuit is proposed, which is based on a novel current-mode detection and comparison technique. The circuit allows a faster protection lock-in, by enabling peak detection and loop frequency compensation to be performed at the same circuit node, thus reducing the number of low-frequency poles and improving loop bandwidth. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through the implementation of a monolithic 0.25-mum 2-V CMOS power amplifier for GSM applications, which can deliver a 3-W output power with 55% overall PAE. The amplifier is able to sustain a 20:1 load VSWR at full power. Excellent RF performance and VSWR ruggedness are hence attained simultaneously, despite a simple common-emitter power stage is used. An experimental reliability assessment allowed the cognizant choice of the maximum drain-gate stress that could be tolerated. Device degradation was characterized by operating a power gain cell at RF, under real-world load and power conditions. Analysis of the degradation data enabled the design of an efficient, yet provably reliable, power amplifier.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2001894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2001894","startPage":"2057","endPage":"2066","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4625985/04626005.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology for Fast VSWR Protection Implemented in a Monolithic 3-W 55% PAE RF CMOS Power Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology for Fast VSWR Protection Implemented in a Monolithic 3-W 55% PAE RF CMOS Power Amplifier","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626005/","accessionNumber":"10222346","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626005/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology for Fast VSWR Protection Implemented in a Monolithic 3-W 55% PAE RF CMOS Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"jssc-presti-2001894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070405S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4625985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4625985","articleId":"4626005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4626006,"authors":[{"name":"Kok Lim Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4625985/4626006/4626006-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kok Lim Chan received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Nayang Technological University, Singapore, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of California at San Diego in 2008.","Currently, he is a Senior Research Engineer at the Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore.

We verified that it was difficult to provide the stability without any decrease in Icell and any increase in the cell-area penalty only by using the previously proposed techniques for a 1-port cell, and have proposed a new cell biasing technique that controlled the level of the cell VSS (VSSM) with a dual-Vdd and a reduced write-bit-line (WBL) precharge scheme for an 8-transistor (8T) 2-port cell to address the above issue. In this paper, a further consideration was newly demonstrated about the stability for a 2-port SRAM under the random fluctuation of the threshold-voltage (Vth) in 65-nm CMOS technology. The stability with the proposed biasing was compared with that of the conventional cell-Vdd (VDDM) control for write assist. The results under 4-sigma random-Vth fluctuation verified that the minimum Icell at a simultaneously R/W-disturbed cell increased by 2.4 times at Vdd=0.9 V while improving the write margin (WRTM). The cell size based on the same Icell was reduced by 20%. The minimum static noise margin (SNM) was also improved by 44%. Each stability also had the tolerance against 6-sigma random-Vth fluctuation. Furthermore, we have challenged to apply the proposed cell biasing to a 7-transistor (7T) 2-port cell design for area saving with a unique write-assist scheme. The cell size was reduced by 26% with the 7T cell compared with that of the conventional 8T cell. This proposed cell biasing satisfied all the requirements of 2-port SRAM operation while improving stability and saving cell size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","volume":"43","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10222351","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626010/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Stable 2-Port SRAM Cell Design Against Simultaneously Read/Write-Disturbed Accesses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stable 2-Port SRAM Cell Design Against Simultaneously Read/Write-Disturbed Accesses","sourcePdf":"jssc-suzuki-2001872.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066637S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4625985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4625985","articleId":"4626010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4626011,"authors":[{"name":"Jri Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4625985/4626011/4626011-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jri Lee (S'03-M'04) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), both in 2003.","After two years of military service (1995\u20131997), he was with Academia Sinica, Taipei, from 1997 to 1998, and subsequently Intel Corporation from 2000 to 2002.

The adaptation strategy is verified in a 90-nm test chip on both the transmitter finite-impulse response filter (Tx-FIR) and the receiver decision-feedback equalizer (Rx-DFE). The performance is compared with the commonly used sign-sign least mean square (SS-LMS) adaptation and demonstrates significant improvements especially in the case of the Tx-FIR. This paper also demonstrates that in a highly attenuating system that contains both a Tx-FIR and Rx-DFE, using a Tx-FIR subject to peak output power constraint to compensate pre-cursor ISI is worse than solely using an Rx-DFE. The adaptation strategy is further applied to adapt the sampling phase of the clock-and-data recovery loop (CDR). The technique enables near-optimal BER performance by substantially reducing the pre-cursor ISI and requires almost no additional hardware compared to SS-LMS adaptation.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2001871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4625985/04626013.pdf","startPage":"2144","endPage":"2156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2001871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4625985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Optimal Equalizer and Timing Adaptation for I/O Links Using a BER-Based Metric","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626013/","displayDocTitle":"Near-Optimal Equalizer and Timing Adaptation for I/O Links Using a BER-Based Metric","volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222354","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626013/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Optimal Equalizer and Timing Adaptation for I/O Links Using a BER-Based Metric","sourcePdf":"jssc-chen-2001871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092839S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4625985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4625985","articleId":"4626013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626015,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Lu","affiliation":["ASIC and System State Key Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37696210100"},{"name":"Zhangwen Tang","affiliation":["ASIC and System State Key Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhangwen","lastName":"Tang","id":"37289978500"},{"name":"Pietro Andreani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Andreani","id":"37273038700"},{"name":"Andrea Mazzanti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Mazzanti","id":"37281781500"},{"name":"Ali Hajimiri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Hajimiri","id":"37275631100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"4626015","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2317},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626015","abstract":"A recently published correction to the expression of phase noise in general electrical oscillators, derived through a frequency-domain analysis, is incorrect.

These duality results provide an alternative proof of the insufficiency of linear (and abelian) network codes, and demonstrate the utility of non-Shannon inequalities to tighten outer bounds on network coding capacity regions.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","startPage":"4470","endPage":"4487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dualities Between Entropy Functions and Network Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dualities Between Entropy Functions and Network Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626049/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222366","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626049/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dualities Between Entropy Functions and Network Codes","sourcePdf":"54tit10-chan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121906S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4626047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4626047","articleId":"4626049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4626055,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Devetak","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Department of Mathematics, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Devetak","id":"37275108000"},{"name":"Aram W.

Our eavesdropper can be viewed as the wireless counterpart of Wyner's wiretapper. The secrecy capacity of such a system is characterized under the assumption of asymptotically long coherence intervals. We first consider the full channel state information (CSI) case, where the transmitter has access to the channel gains of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. The secrecy capacity under this full CSI assumption serves as an upper bound for the secrecy capacity when only the CSI of the legitimate receiver is known at the transmitter, which is characterized next. In each scenario, the perfect secrecy capacity is obtained along with the optimal power and rate allocation strategies. We then propose a low-complexity on/off power allocation strategy that achieves near-optimal performance with only the main channel CSI. More specifically, this scheme is shown to be asymptotically optimal as the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity, and interestingly, is shown to attain the secrecy capacity under the full CSI assumption. Overall, channel fading has a positive impact on the secrecy capacity and rate adaptation, based on the main channel CSI, is critical in facilitating secure communications over slow fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","volume":"54","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"10222371","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Secrecy Capacity of Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Secrecy Capacity of Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"54tit10-gopala-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049212S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","isNumber":"4626047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"852","articleId":"4626059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4626060,"authors":[{"name":"Masahito Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan","Quantum Computation and Information Project,ERATO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahito","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37533252800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4626060","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":123,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":542},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Quantum computing","Random variables","Entropy","Educational technology","Error probability","Data mining","Data compression","Quantum mechanics","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order asymptotics","fixed-length source coding","intrinsic randomness","independent random variables","identically distributed random variables","Markovian variables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fixed-length source coding","information spectrum","intrinsic randomness","second-order asymptotics","source coding folklore"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second-Order Asymptotics in Fixed-Length Source Coding and Intrinsic Randomness","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","endPage":"4637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626060.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928985","startPage":"4619","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626060","abstract":"There is a difference between the optimal rates of fixed-length source coding and intrinsic randomness when we care about the second-order asymptotics.

The constructions are based on the theory of rings of algebraic integers and related subrings of the Hamiltonian quaternions and can be extended to a larger number of Tx antennas. The usage of ideals guarantees an NVD larger than one and an easy way to present the exact proofs for the minimum determinants. The idea of finding denser sublattices within a given division algebra is then generalized to a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) case with an arbitrary number of Tx antennas by using the theory of cyclic division algebras (CDAs) and maximal orders. It is also shown that the explicit constructions in this paper all have a simple decoding method based on sphere decoding. Related to the decoding complexity, the notion of sensitivity is introduced, and experimental evidence indicating a connection between sensitivity, decoding complexity, and performance is provided. Simulations in a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel show that our dense quaternionic constructions outperform both the earlier rectangular lattices and the rotated quasi-orthogonal ABBA lattice as well as the diagonal algebraic space-time (DAST) lattice. We also show that our quaternionic lattice is better than the DAST lattice in terms of the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT).","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928998","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626061.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"4493","endPage":"4510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximal Orders in the Design of Dense Space-Time Lattice Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Maximal Orders in the Design of Dense Space-Time Lattice Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626061/","volume":"54","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4626061/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10208414","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximal Orders in the Design of Dense Space-Time Lattice Codes","sourcePdf":"54tit10-hollanti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13885S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4626047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4626047","articleId":"4626061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626063,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhua Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jinhua","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37291790800"},{"name":"Yan Xin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xin","id":"37293344500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4626063","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626063","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Degradation","Wireless sensor networks","Decoding","Collaboration","Receivers","Cognitive radio","Time sharing computer systems","Region 1","Scholarships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","interference (signal)","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate region","interference channels","degraded message sets","communication model","a priori knowledge","coding scheme","cooperative coding","collaborative coding","dirty paper coding","discrete memoryless case","Gaussian case","high-interference-gain regime"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","dirty paper coding","Gel'fand\u2013Pinsker coding","interference channel","superposition coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.929026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626063.pdf","startPage":"4707","endPage":"4712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.929026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Achievable Rate Regions for Interference Channels With Degraded Message Sets","abstract":"The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a communication model, in which two senders attempt to communicate with their respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one sender has complete and a priori (noncausal) knowledge about the message being transmitted by the other.

Three different scenarios are considered: relay-to-source, destination-to-relay, and destination-to-source-and-relay CSF. In the relay-to-source CSF scenario, it is found that using merely one bit of CSF to control the source transmit power is sufficient to achieve the multiantenna upper bound in a range of multiplexing gains. In the destination-to-relay CSF scenario, the systems slightly outperform dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF) at high multiplexing gains, even with only one bit of feedback. Finally, in the destination-to-source-and-relay CSF scenario, if the source-relay channel gain is unknown to the feedback quantizer at the destination, the diversity gain only grows linearly in the number of feedback levels, in sharp contrast to an exponential growth for multiantenna channels. In this last scenario, a simple scheme is shown to perform close to the corresponding upper bound.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Relays","State feedback","Fading","Power system relaying","Resource management","Protocols","Upper bound","Power control","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","fading channels","multiplexing","resource allocation","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode-and-forward relaying","quantized channel state feedback","outage exponent analysis","resource allocation","fading relay channel","decode-and-forward protocol","relay-to-source","destination-to-relay","destination-to-source-and-relay CSF","multiantenna upper bound","multiplexing gains","source-relay channel gain","feedback quantizer","diversity gain","multiantenna channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communications","diversity methods","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","fading channels","large-deviation analysis","power control","relay channels"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626064.pdf","startPage":"4548","endPage":"4564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decode-and-Forward Relaying With Quantized Channel State Feedback: An Outage Exponent Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decode-and-Forward Relaying With Quantized Channel State Feedback: An Outage Exponent Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626064/","volume":"54","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626064/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10222374","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decode-and-Forward Relaying With Quantized Channel State Feedback: An Outage Exponent Analysis","sourcePdf":"54tit10-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110062S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4626047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4626047","articleId":"4626064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4626065,"authors":[{"name":"Il Han Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Il Han","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239246100"},{"name":"David J.

This capacity gain can often be leveraged by utilizing channel state information at the transmitter and the receiver. Users make use of this channel state information for transmit signal adaptation. In this correspondence, we derive the capacity region for the MIMO multiple access channel (MIMO MAC) when partial channel state information is available at the transmitters, where we assume a synchronous MIMO multiuser uplink. The partial channel state information feedback has a cardinality constraint and is fed back from the basestation to the users using a limited rate feedback channel. Using this feedback information, we propose a finite codebook design method to maximize the sum rate. In this correspondence, the codebook is a set of transmit signal covariance matrices. We also derive the capacity region and codebook design methods in the case that the covariance matrix is rank one (i.e., beam- forming). This is motivated by the fact that beamforming is optimal in certain conditions. The simulation results show that when the number of feedback bits increases, the capacity also increases. Even with a small number of feedback bits, the performance of the proposed system is close to an optimal solution with the full feedback.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626065.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","startPage":"4712","endPage":"4724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Capacity and Design of Limited Feedback Multiuser MIMO Uplinks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity and Design of Limited Feedback Multiuser MIMO Uplinks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222375","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626065/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity and Design of Limited Feedback Multiuser MIMO Uplinks","sourcePdf":"54tit10-kim-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085271S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4626047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4626047","articleId":"4626065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4626068,"authors":[{"name":"Darryl Dexu Lin","affiliation":["Qualcomm Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Darryl Dexu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37287663500"},{"name":"Teng Joon Lim","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Teng Joon","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280114800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4626068","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Multiuser detection","Equalizers","Multiple access interference","Binary phase shift keying","Iterative decoding","MIMO","Information theory","Amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","Gray codes","intersymbol interference","iterative decoding","message passing","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-level equalization","soft detection","Gray-coded multilevel modulation","iterative soft-in-soft-out detection","coded multiple access channels","Gray-coded M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","channel symbols","generic iterative detection scheme","unified variational inference framework","binary soft-in-soft-out detection","data symbols","bits estimation","posterior probabilities","message-passing","joint detection","decoding","turbo multiuser detection","multiple-access interference channels","turbo equalization","inter-symbol interference channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free energy","Gray encoding","$M$-ary modulation","soft-in\u2013soft-out (SISO) detection","turbo equalization","turbo multiuser detection","variational inference"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Level Equalization and Soft Detection for Gray-Coded Multilevel Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626068","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928972","startPage":"4731","endPage":"4742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626068.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","abstract":"This correspondence investigates iterative soft-in-soft-out (SISO) detection in coded multiple access channels, with Gray-coded \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for the channel symbols. The proposed solution may be summarized as a generic iterative detection scheme called bit-level equalization and soft detection (BLESD), which is an extension of a unified variational inference framework for binary SISO detection proposed in our prior work. This new strategy fundamentally differs from the conventional symbol detector, in that data symbols are transparent to the new detector. Rather, soft estimates of the bits that make up the symbols are directly and naturally obtained by the detector in terms of posterior probabilities given the channel observation, facilitating efficient message-passing in joint detection and decoding. Case studies that illustrate the applications of the proposed scheme are presented for turbo multiuser detection (MUD) for multiple-access interference (MAI) channels and turbo equalization for inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626068/","volume":"54","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4626068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222378","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Level Equalization and Soft Detection for Gray-Coded Multilevel Modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Level Equalization and Soft Detection for Gray-Coded Multilevel Modulation","sourcePdf":"54tit10-lin-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072237S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4626047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4626047","articleId":"4626068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4626069,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279478200"},{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian-Kang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281463700"},{"name":"Kon Max Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Kon Max","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4626069","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Block codes","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Constellation diagram","Modulation coding","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Maximum likelihood detection","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","maximum likelihood detection","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-diversity codes","MISO systems","linear detectors","space-time block codes","wireless communication system","multiple-input-single-output system","Toeplitz code","quadratic-amplitude modulation","flat-fading channels","zero-forcing receiver","maximum-likelihood detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full diversity","linear receiver","maximum-likelihood (ML) detection","multiple-input\u2013single-output (MISO)","nonvanishing determinant","optimal diversity-versus-multiplexing tradeoff","space-time block codes (STBC)","Toeplitz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a general criterion for space-time block codes (STBC) to achieve full diversity with a linear receiver is proposed for a wireless communication system having multiple transmitter and single receiver antennas [multiple-input-single-output (MISO)]. Particularly, the STBC with Toeplitz structure satisfies this criterion, and therefore, enables full diversity. Further examination of this Toeplitz STBC reveals the following important properties: (1) the symbol transmission rate can be made to approach unity; (2) applying the Toeplitz code to any signalling scheme having nonzero distance between the nearest constellation points results in a nonvanishing determinant. In addition, if quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM) is used as the signalling scheme, then for independent MISO flat-fading channels, the Toeplitz codes is proved to approach the optimal diversity-versus-multiplexing tradeoff with a zero-forcing (ZF) receiver when the number of channel uses is large. This is, so far, the first nonorthogonal STBC shown to achieve the optimal tradeoff for such a receiver. On the other hand, when maximum-likelihood (ML) detection is employed in a MISO system, the Toeplitz STBC achieves the maximum coding gain for independent channels. When the channel fading coefficients are correlated, the inherent transmission matrix in the Toeplitz STBC can be designed to minimize the average worst case pairwise error probability.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626069.pdf","startPage":"4511","endPage":"4527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Diversity Codes for MISO Systems Equipped With Linear or ML Detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626069/","displayDocTitle":"Full-Diversity Codes for MISO Systems Equipped With Linear or ML Detectors","volume":"54","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222379","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626069/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Diversity Codes for MISO Systems Equipped With Linear or ML Detectors","sourcePdf":"54tit10-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127785S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4626047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4626047","articleId":"4626069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626071,"authors":[{"name":"Emin Martinian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Emin","lastName":"Martinian","id":"37284179100"},{"name":"Gregory W.

Recently, Zhang-Liu-Wong introduced Toeplitz codes and showed that Toeplitz codes achieve full diversity when a linear receiver, zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver, is used. Motivated from Zhang-Liu-Wong's results on Toeplitz codes, in this paper, we propose a design criterion for space-time block codes (STBC), in which information symbols and their complex conjugates are linearly embedded, to achieve full diversity when ZF or MMSE receiver is used. The (complex) orthogonal STBC (OSTBC) satisfy the criterion as one may expect. We also show that the symbol rates of STBC under this criterion are upper bounded by 1. Subsequently, we propose a novel family of STBC that satisfy the criterion and thus achieve full diversity with ZF or MMSE receiver. Our newly proposed STBC are constructed by overlapping the 2times2 Alamouti code and hence named overlapped Alamouti codes in this paper. The new codes are close to orthogonal and their symbol rates can approach 1 for any number of transmit antennas. Simulation results show that overlapped Alamouti codes significantly outperform Toeplitz codes for all numbers of transmit antennas and also outperform OSTBC when the number of transmit antennas is above 4.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space\u2013Time Block Codes Achieving Full Diversity With Linear Receivers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928986","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4626047/04626075.pdf","startPage":"4528","endPage":"4547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Space\u2013Time Block Codes Achieving Full Diversity With Linear Receivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4626075/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222384","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space\u2013Time Block Codes Achieving Full Diversity With Linear Receivers","sourcePdf":"54tit10-shang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14476S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4626047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4626047","articleId":"4626075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4626076,"authors":[{"name":"Songsri Sirianunpiboon","affiliation":["Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Edinburgh, Australia"],"firstName":"Songsri","lastName":"Sirianunpiboon","id":"37355570300"},{"name":"A.

Two independent messages are transmitted: a common message and a message transmitted by the informed encoder. We find explicit characterizations of the capacity region with both noncausal and causal state information. Further, we study the noise-free binary case, and we also apply the general formula to the Gaussian case with noncausal channel state information, under an individual power constraint as well as a sum power constraint.

On the other hand, the block-iterative generalized decision-feedback equalizer (BI-GDFE) attains close to the performance of the MMSE-SIC receivers with further reduced complexity. The BI-GDFE, however, requires an accurate estimate of the input-decision correlation (IDC), which is a statistical reliability metric of earlier-made decisions. To date, the BI-GDFE receiver is applicable only to phase-shift-keying (PSK) modulations due to the absence of a method to estimate the IDC for higher order quadrature amplitude modulations (QAMs). In this paper, we establish the relationship between the MMSE-SIC and BI-GDFE receivers and propose an algorithm to determine the IDC for BI-GDFE from the unconditional MMSE-SIC (U-MMSE-SIC). We further analyze and compare the asymptotic performances of the two receivers for large random MIMO channels and prove that for the limiting case, the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at each iteration for both receivers converge in probability to their respective deterministic limits. Our simulation results have shown that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the BI-GDFE receiver with the proposed IDC selection method achieves close to that of the U-MMSE-SIC receiver with similar convergence behavior and reaches the single-user matched filter bound (MFB) with several iterations for high enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626083","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Interference cancellation","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Decision feedback equalizers","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","error statistics","estimation theory","interference suppression","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","matched filters","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large multiple-input multiple-output channels","minimum mean-square error","iterative soft interference cancellation receiver","MIMO channels","maximum-likelihood detection","block-iterative generalized decision-feedback equalizer","input-decision correlation","statistical reliability metric","phase-shift-keying modulations","PSK modulations","estimation method","higher order quadrature amplitude modulations","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios","bit error rate","BER performance","single-user matched filter bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic performance","iterative receivers","large systems","low complexity","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","random matrix theory"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567633/04626083.pdf","startPage":"3627","endPage":"3637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.921723","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.921723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Relationship Between MMSE-SIC and BI-GDFE Receivers for Large Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626083/","displayDocTitle":"On the Relationship Between MMSE-SIC and BI-GDFE Receivers for Large Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Channels","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115142","htmlLink":"/document/4626083/","volume":"56","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Relationship Between MMSE-SIC and BI-GDFE Receivers for Large Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-liang-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087982S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4626083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4626085,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed M.

The result is a more cautious filter, which can be interpreted as an implicit and automatic way to increase the state noise covariance. On the other hand, the process of jittering, or roughening, is well known in particle filters to mitigate sample impoverishment. The purpose of this contribution is to introduce risk-sensitive particle filters (RSPF) as an alternative approach to mitigate sample impoverishment based on constructing explicit risk functions from a general class of factorizable functions. It is first shown that RSF can be done in nonlinear systems using a recursion of an infinite dimensional information state which involves general risk functions. Then, this information state calculation is carried out using particle approximations. Some alternative approaches, generalizations, specific cases, comparison to existing methods of sample impoverishment mitigation and issues related to the selection of risk functions and parameters are examined. Performance of the resulting filter using various risk functions is illustrated on a simulated scenario and compared with the roughening method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626104/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235311","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Risk-Sensitive Particle Filters for Mitigating Sample Impoverishment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk-Sensitive Particle Filters for Mitigating Sample Impoverishment","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-orguner-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07574S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4626104","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626106,"authors":[{"name":"Byonghyo Shim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4626084/4626106/4626106-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byonghyo Shim (M'97) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control and instrumentation engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1995 and 1997, respectively.

For the convenience of residual generator design, influence caused by network-induced delay is first transformed into time-varying polytopic uncertainty, which greatly facilitates further manipulation. Then design of the optimal residual generator is formulated as a model matching problem, i.e., to design a residual generator best matching the optimal residual generator of NCS in the delay free case. This procedure is assisted by parameter-dependent Lyapunov function matrix based bounded real lemma, which has been proved to be much better than single constant Lyapunov function matrix based results. This approach not only can be used in conditions that the variation part of the delay is less than one sampling period, but also can be applied to scenarios where the variation part of the delay is larger than one sampling period. Simulation results are also given to illustrate effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2008","volume":"56","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"10208458","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626109/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A New Fault Detection Scheme for Networked Control Systems Subject to Uncertain Time-Varying Delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Fault Detection Scheme for Networked Control Systems Subject to Uncertain Time-Varying Delay","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-ywang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09459S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4626109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":4626154,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hao Hsu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Hao","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37276771500"},{"name":"Achilleas Anastasopoulos","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Achilleas","lastName":"Anastasopoulos","id":"37278634900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4626154","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":738},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626154","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","AWGN","Graph theory","Performance analysis","H infinity control","Concatenated codes","Wireless networks","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel capacity","channel coding","maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity achieving LDPC codes","low-definition parity-check codes","ML decoding","maximum-likelihood decoding","AWD","average weight distributions","puncturing","memoryless binary-input output-symmetric channel","MBIOS","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic growth rate","average weight distribution","capacity-achieving codes","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding","punctured codes","rate-adaptable codes"]}],"abstract":"The performance of punctured low-definition parity-check (LDPC) codes under maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding is studied in this correspondence via deriving and analyzing their average weight distributions (AWDs) and the corresponding asymptotic growth rate of the AWDs. In particular, it is proved that capacity-achieving codes of any rate and for any memoryless binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS) channel under ML decoding can be constructed by puncturing some original LDPC code with small enough rate. Moreover, it is shown that the gap to capacity of all the punctured codes can be the same as the original code with a small enough rate. Conditions under which puncturing results in no rate loss with asymptotically high probability are also given in the process.

It was tackled in the past by mainly focusing on cases with either mean or covariance feedback alone. The difficulty with generic MISO optimization arises from the fact that the treatment of optimal beam directions and power allocation are no longer separable, thereby making the problem nearly impossible to be tackled on the basis of its current formulation. We therefore take a different philosophy by representing the derivative of the ergodic capacity as a single integral and linking it to the channel characteristic function. This new formulation allows us to obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions, simply in the form of two vector equations which can be efficiently solved by a Newton-Raphson type algorithm developed in this paper.

Subcarriers Allocation Scheme for Cognitive Radio Systems Based on Multi-Carrier Modulation","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is a dynamic spectrum access technology as a solution to spectrum under-utilization problem in some licensed bands. Operating over an exceedingly wide spectrum, CR systems usually adopt multi-carrier modulation (MCM) to implement flexible channelization. Consequently, efficient channel allocation scheme becomes extremely important to an MCM based CR (MCM-CR) system. In this paper, a maximum likelihood detection model is developed to detect the presence and locations of licensed users (LUs) signals in the frequency domain. Performance of the detection model, including the optimal detection region, detection probability and false alarm probability, is analyzed. A one-order two-state Markovian chain model is proposed to predict channel status information. In particular, a novel subcarrier allocation scheme for MCM-CR systems is proposed, taking into account the confidence of channel estimation, quality of services (QoS) of rental users (RUs) and throughput. To validate the analytical results, simulations have been conducted to show effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","volume":"7","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10208495","publicationDate":"September 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626307/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Subcarriers Allocation Scheme for Cognitive Radio Systems Based on Multi-Carrier Modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Subcarriers Allocation Scheme for Cognitive Radio Systems Based on Multi-Carrier Modulation","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061487S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626311,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lan Huang","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Beijing, China","Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626311/4626311-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Lan Huang (S'04-M'07) was born in Hunan, China, in August 1982.

In contrast to conventional systems where the medium access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers are separately optimized, our proposed methodology jointly designs a multi-packet reception (MPR) based protocol with adaptive resource allocation. Specifically, a realistic collision model is employed by taking into consideration the PHY layer parameters such as channel information, space-time coded beamforming and multiuser detection, as well as sub-carrier, bit, and power allocation. The allocation problem is formulated, so as to maximize the system throughput, subject to the constraints from both the MAC and PHY layers. These constraints depend on the results of access contention, data packetsiquest length, usersiquest spatial correlation and the quality of channel feedback information. An iterative algorithm is then provided to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results will show that our proposed approach achieves significant improvement in system performance such as average throughput and packet delay, compared with conventional schemes where cross-layer design and optimization is not used.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","startPage":"3372","endPage":"3384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Multi-Packet Reception Based Medium Access Control and Resource Allocation for Space-Time Coded MIMO/OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Multi-Packet Reception Based Medium Access Control and Resource Allocation for Space-Time Coded MIMO/OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235374","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626311/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Multi-Packet Reception Based Medium Access Control and Resource Allocation for Space-Time Coded MIMO/OFDM","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107189S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626312,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Lopez Vicario","affiliation":["Universitat Authn\u00f2ma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626312/4626312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jose Lopez Vicario (S'04-M'08) was born in Blanes, Spain, in 1979.

To do so, as many random beamformers as transmit antennas (M) are generated and on each beam the user experiencing the most favorable channel conditions is scheduled. Whereas for a large number of users the sum-rate of ORB exhibits an identical growth rate as that of dirty paper coding, performance in sparse networks (or in networks with an uneven spatial distribution of users) is known to be severely impaired. To circumvent that, in this paper we modify the scheduling process in ORB in order to select a subset out of the M available beams. We propose several beam selection algorithms and assess their performance in terms of sum-rate and aggregated throughput (i.e., rate achieved with practical modulation and coding schemes), along with an analysis of their computational complexity. Since ORB schemes require partial channel state information (CSI) to be fed back to the transmitter, we finally investigate the impact of CSI quantization on system performance. More specifically, we prove that most of the MUD can be still exploited with very few quantization bits and we derive a beam selection approach trading-off system performance vs. feedback channel requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626312.pdf","startPage":"3385","endPage":"3396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Selection Strategies for Orthogonal Random Beamforming in Sparse Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Multiuser detection","Quantization","System performance","OFDM","Broadcasting","Transmitting antennas","Processor scheduling","Throughput","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","diversity reception","multiuser channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam selection","orthogonal random beamforming","sparse networks","spatial multiplexing","multi-user diversity","multi-antenna broadcast channels","computational complexity","channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal Random Beamforming (ORB)","beam selection","sparse networks","opportunistic scheduling","Multi-user Diversity (MUD)","broadcast channel","feedback quantization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Beam Selection Strategies for Orthogonal Random Beamforming in Sparse Networks","volume":"7","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4626312/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235375","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Selection Strategies for Orthogonal Random Beamforming in Sparse Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074983S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4626313,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias J.

In the multiple access phase nodes 1 and 2 transmit their message to the relay node, which decodes the messages and forwards them in the succeeding broadcast phase. Therefore, the relay node encodes the multicast and bidirectional messages using the superposition encoding strategy. We do not allow cooperation between the encoders of nodes 1 and 2, but since both nodes know a priori its own bidirectional message, both nodes can cancel the interference caused by their own message before decoding the unknown messages. It shows that for both nodes it is always optimal to decode the relay message first. Furthermore, the total sum-rate maximum is determined by the sum-rate optimum of the bidirectional broadcast phase. From the closed form solutions of the combinatorial problems we can characterize the bidirectional rate pairs where the total sum-rate remains constant. In the end the obtained results are discussed and illustrated by means of some working examples. The joint resource allocation improves the overall spectral efficiency and enables new trade-offs between the routing tasks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Decoding","Resource management","Broadcasting","Convergence","Wireless sensor networks","Transceivers","Receivers","Multicast protocols","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","multi-access systems","multicast communication","radiocommunication","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common message piggybacking","half-duplex bidirectional relaying","joint resource allocation","three-node network","half-duplex relay node","multicast message","multiple access communication","superposition encoding strategy","sum-rate maximum","routing tasks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bidirectional communication","decode-and-forward","half-duplex relay","achievable rate region","multicast"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060841","startPage":"3397","endPage":"3406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626313.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piggyback a Common Message on Half-Duplex Bidirectional Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Piggyback a Common Message on Half-Duplex Bidirectional Relaying","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10235376","publicationDate":"September 2008","volume":"7","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626313/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piggyback a Common Message on Half-Duplex Bidirectional Relaying","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061678S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626314,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) Company Limited, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626314/4626314-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Li received the B.S. degree in electronics and information science from Beijing University, Beijing, China, in 1998, with a minor in Economics.

The decoding of IN-corrupted signals is complicated by the fact that accurate IN statistics are typically unavailable at the receiver. Without exploiting the IN statistics, the conventional method is to try to mark the IN-corrupted symbols as erasures preceding a Euclidean metric based decoder. In this work, a novel joint erasure marking and Viterbi algorithm (JEVA) is proposed to decode the convolutionally coded data transmitted over an unknown impulsive noise channel. Based on the Bernoulli-Gaussian IN model, it is empirically demonstrated that JEVA not only can offer significant performance improvement over the conventional separate erasure marking and Viterbi decoding method, but also can almost achieve the optimal performance of the maximum likelihood decoder that fully exploits the perfect knowledge of the IN probability density function. Various implementations of JEVA are proposed to provide different performance-complexity trade-offs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10208496","htmlLink":"/document/4626314/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Erasure Marking and Viterbi Decoding Algorithm for Unknown Impulsive Noise Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Erasure Marking and Viterbi Decoding Algorithm for Unknown Impulsive Noise Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070744S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626314","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626315,"authors":[{"name":"Ozgur Ozdemir","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX","Fatih University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626315/4626315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Murat Torlak received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 1995 and 1999, respectively.

For instance, the channel fluctuations of the users in a network are exploited as multiuser diversity by scheduling the user with the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). When fading is slow, beamforming at a multiple antenna transmitter is used to induce artificial channel fluctuations to ensure multiuser diversity in the network. Such a beamforming scheme is called opportunistic beamforming since the transmitter uses random beamforming to artificially induce opportunism in the network [1]. Opportunism requires a large number of users in the system in order to reach the performance of the true beamforming that uses perfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper we investigate the benefit of having partial CSI at an opportunistic transmitter. In the investigation, we focus on the maximum normalized SNR scheduling where user's feedback consists of SNR relative to its channel gain. We show that opportunism can be beneficially used to increase the average throughput of the system. Simulations support the analytical average throughput results obtained as the amount of CSI and the number of users vary.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","volume":"7","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10235377","publicationDate":"September 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626315/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Beamforming over Rayleigh Channels with Partial Side Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Beamforming over Rayleigh Channels with Partial Side Information","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3417.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102077S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626318,"authors":[{"name":"Soung Chang Liew","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626318/4626318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soung Chang Liew (S'87-VM'88-VSM'92) re- ceived his S.B., S.M., E.E., and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The contributions of Part I are threefold. (i) We present the fundamental properties and physical/economic interpretation of PF optimality. We show that PF leads to equal airtime allocation to users for the singlechannel case; and equal equivalent airtime allocation to users for the multi-channel case. In addition, we also establish the Pareto efficiency of joint-channel PF optimal solution (the formulation of interest to us in this paper), and its superiority over the individual-channel PF optimal solution in that the individual user throughputs of the former are all equal to or greater than the corresponding user throughputs of the latter. (ii) Second, we derive characteristics of joint-channel PF optimal solutions useful for the construction of PF-optimization algorithms. In particular, we show that a PF solution typically consists of many zero airtime assignments when the difference between the number of users U and the number of channels S, |U - S|, is large. We present several PF-optimization algorithms, including a fast algorithm that is amenable to parallel implementation. (iii) Third, we study the use of PF utility for resource allocation in large-scale WiFi networks consisting of many adjacent wireless LANs. We find that the PF solution simultaneously achieves higher system throughput, better fairness, and lower outage probability with respect to the default solution given by today's 802.11 commercial products. Part II of this paper series extends our investigation to the time-varying-channel case in which the data rates enjoyed by users over the channels vary dynamically over time.","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626318.pdf","startPage":"3446","endPage":"3456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070256","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070256","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626318","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Wireless LAN","Resource management","Throughput","Wireless networks","Bandwidth","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimisation","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication standards","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proportional fairness","multichannel multirate wireless network","deterministic channel","AP association problem","large-scale WLAN","resource allocation","scheduling","airtime allocation","Pareto efficiency","PF-optimization","large-scale WiFi network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Proportional fairness","scheduling","resource allocation","AP association","WLAN, 802.11","WiFi, wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Proportional Fairness in Multi-Channel Multi-Rate Wireless Networks-Part I: The Case of Deterministic Channels with Application to AP Association Problem in Large-Scale WLAN","accessionNumber":"10235379","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626318/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proportional Fairness in Multi-Channel Multi-Rate Wireless Networks-Part I: The Case of Deterministic Channels with Application to AP Association Problem in Large-Scale WLAN","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3446.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105297S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4626319,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626319/4626319-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soung Chang Liew (S'87-VM'88-VSM'92) re- ceived his S.B., S.M., E.E., and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The design procedure presented at the end of the paper will allow researchers to probe the new radioscapes that result as wireless systems are pushed to higher carrier frequencies, wider bandwidths, multiple antennas, and ubiquitous operation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Sliding Correlator Channel Sounder Design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070278","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626322.pdf","startPage":"3488","endPage":"3497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Sliding Correlator Channel Sounder Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4626322/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235383","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Sliding Correlator Channel Sounder Design","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3488.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058231S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4626326,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Choqueuse","affiliation":["Laboratory E3I2, EA 3876, ENSIETA-Ecole Nationale Superieure des Ingenieurs des Etudes et Techniques d''Armement, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Choqueuse","id":"37563968900"},{"name":"Koffi Yao","affiliation":["Laboratory Lab-STICC, FRECNRS 3167, Universite de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Koffi","lastName":"Yao","id":"37595073200"},{"name":"Ludovic Collin","affiliation":["Laboratory Lab-STICC, FRECNRS 3167, Universite de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Ludovic","lastName":"Collin","id":"37294003000"},{"name":"Gilles Burel","affiliation":["Laboratory Lab-STICC, FRECNRS 3167, Universite de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Burel","id":"37268166900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4626326","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":424},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Transmitters","Timing","MIMO","Space time codes","Military communication","Wireless communication","Electronic warfare","Signal detection","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","correlation methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","radiocommunication","space-time codes","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical space-time block code recognition","correlation matrices","blind recognition","communication parameters","commercial communication systems","military communication systems","symbol timing estimation","modulation recognition","transmitters identification","multiple transmitter communications","wireless communication","timing synchronization","Frobenius norms","spatial multiplexing","Alamouti Coding","orthogonal codes","low signal-to-noise ratios","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","space-time coding","electronic warfare"]}],"abstract":"The blind recognition of communication parameters is a key research issue for commercial and military communication systems. The results of numerous investigations about symbol timing estimation, modulation recognition as well as identification of the number of transmitters have been reported in the literature. But, to our knowledge, none of them have dealt with the recognition of the Space-Time Block Codes (STBC) used in multiple transmitter communications. In order to blindly recognize the STBC of a wireless communication, this paper proposes a method based on the space-time correlations of the received signals. Under perfect timing synchronization and under ideal conditions (full rank channel and a number of receivers greater or equal to the number of transmitters), it shows that the Frobenius norms of these statistics present non-null values whose positions only depend on the STBC at the transmitter side. A classifier for the space-time code recognition of 5 linear STBC (Spatial Multiplexing, Alamouti Coding, and 3 Orthogonal STBC using 3 antennas) is presented. Simulations show that the proposed method performs well even at low signal-to-noise ratios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Space-Time Block Code Recognition Using Correlation Matrices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070364","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626326.pdf","startPage":"3526","endPage":"3534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Space-Time Block Code Recognition Using Correlation Matrices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4626326/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235386","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Space-Time Block Code Recognition Using Correlation Matrices","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3526.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079762S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626328,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Shen","affiliation":["Lectrical Engineering Department, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626328/4626328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cong Shen (S'01) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in 2002 and 2004, respectively, from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

We derive the optimal resource allocation policies by directly maximizing at the application layer the weighted sum of video qualities of all users, subject to information-theoretic multiaccess capacity region constraints in the MAC-PHY layers. We solve this problem for three multiaccess capacity regions: (1) non-fading channel, (2) fading channel with a given power control policy, and (3) fading channel with dynamic power control policies. The optimal resource allocation policy is referred as largest quality improvement highest possible rate (LQIHPR). We propose simple greedy algorithms to implement this policy. Since the capacity region is the fundamental characterization of achievable rates, the solutions developed in this paper provide the operational upper bound of achievable video quality in a multiaccess fading channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626328.pdf","startPage":"3546","endPage":"3557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Multimedia Applications over Multiaccess Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Fading","Physical layer","Throughput","Upper bound","Power control","Wireless networks","Wireless communication","Greedy algorithms","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","greedy algorithms","information theory","multi-access systems","multimedia systems","multiuser channels","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal resource allocation","multimedia application","multiaccess fading channel","multiuser multiaccess wireless video communication","information theory","video quality","multiaccess capacity region constraint","MAC-PHY layers","nonfading channel","dynamic power control policy","largest quality improvement highest possible rate","greedy algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer design and optimization","resource management","multimedia communication","multiuser channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Multimedia Applications over Multiaccess Fading Channels","volume":"7","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4626328/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235388","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Multimedia Applications over Multiaccess Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110982S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626330,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Peng","affiliation":["LitePoint Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Peng","id":"37278945300"},{"name":"William E.

The essential challenge in localization is the severe fluctuation of receive signal strength (RSS) for the mobile client even at a fixed location. This work explores the major noisy source resulted from the multipath in an indoor wireless environment and presents an advanced positioning architecture to reduce the disturbance. Our contribution is to propose a novel approach to extract the robust signal feature from measured RSS which is provided by IEEE 802.11 MAC software so that the multipath effect can be mitigated efficiently. The dynamic multipath behavior, which can be modeled by a convolution operation in the time domain, can be transformed into an additive random variable in the logarithmic spectrum domain. That is, the convolution process becomes a linear and separable operation in the logarithmic spectrum domain and then can be effectively removed. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to enhance the robustness to a multipath fading condition, which is common in the environments of an indoor wireless LAN (WLAN) location fingerprinting system. Our approach is conceptually simple and easy to be implemented for practical applications. Neither a new hardware nor an extra sensor network installation is required. Both analytical simulation and experiments in a real WLAN environment demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to significant performance improvements. The numerical results show that the mean and the standard deviation of estimated error are reduced by 42% and 29%, respectively, as compared to the traditional maximum likelihood based approach. Moreover, the experimental results also show that fewer training samples are required to build the positioning models. This result can be attributed to that the location related information is effectively extracted by our algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626331.pdf","startPage":"3579","endPage":"3588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Algorithm for Multipath Fingerprinting in Indoor WLAN Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Wireless LAN","Robustness","Convolution","Fluctuations","Noise reduction","Working environment noise","Computer architecture","Software measurement","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","indoor radio","maximum likelihood estimation","mobility management (mobile radio)","multipath channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath fingerprinting","indoor WLAN environments","indoor wireless environments","receive signal strength","mobile client","advanced positioning architecture","IEEE 802.11 MAC software","additive random variable","logarithmic spectrum domain","multipath fading condition","indoor wireless LAN location fingerprinting system","maximum likelihood based approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Location fingerprinting","IEEE 802.11","Multipath ","WLAN","location estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Algorithm for Multipath Fingerprinting in Indoor WLAN Environments","volume":"7","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4626331/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10208499","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Algorithm for Multipath Fingerprinting in Indoor WLAN Environments","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089909S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626334,"authors":[{"name":"Thakshila Wimalajeewa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626334/4626334-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thakshila Wimalajeewa (S'07) received the B.

We assume amplify-and-forward local processing at each node. The wireless link between sensors and the fusion center is assumed to undergo fading and coefficients are assumed to be available at the transmitting sensors. The objective is to minimize the total network power to achieve a desired fusion error probability at the fusion center. For i.i.d. observations, the optimal power allocation is derived analytically in closed form. When observations are correlated, first, an easy to optimize upper bound is derived for sufficiently small correlations and the power allocation scheme is derived accordingly. Next, an evolutionary computation technique based on particle swarm optimization is developed to find the optimal power allocation for arbitrary correlations. The optimal power scheduling scheme suggests that the sensors with poor observation quality and bad channels should be inactive to save the total power expenditure of the system. It is shown that the probability of fusion error performance based on the optimal power allocation scheme outperforms the uniform power allocation scheme especially when either the number of sensors is large or the local observation quality is good.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626334.pdf","startPage":"3608","endPage":"3618","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Scheduling for Correlated Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks via Constrained PSO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Scheduling for Correlated Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks via Constrained PSO","volume":"7","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4626334/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235391","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Scheduling for Correlated Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks via Constrained PSO","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079632S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4626337,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626337/4626337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), China, in 2004, and the M.Phil. degree in Information Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, in 2006.

Distributed antennas have been recently shown to provide considerable gains in coverage and capacity, at much lower cost than decreasing cell size. Previous studies have neglected the key sources of randomness in such systems, notably (i) random channel effects (fading and shadowing) and (ii) the random quantity and locations of both the mobile users and the AEs. Typically, path loss has been the focus, and the AEs are assumed to be regularly spaced, both of which are significant idealizations. First, we develop an analytical framework that allows random channels to be accommodated. We use this approach to show that selection transmission (using a single AE) is preferable to maximum ratio transmission (which uses all the AEs) in a multicell environment. Interestingly, the opposite is true in an isolated cell. Second, since AEs are placed opportunistically (on tall structures with backhaul access) rather than regularly, we develop a stochastic geometry-inspired approach to determine the outage probability as a function of the number of randomly placed AEs, which we model as a point process. With selection transmission, the outage probability is shown to decrease exponentially with the number of AEs and users. In the most general setup - with multiple distributed antennas and users, and both AE selection and user selection - we show that randomly deployed AEs provide nearly the same performance as regularly spaced AEs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4626294/04626337.pdf","startPage":"3636","endPage":"3646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Antenna Systems with Randomness","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626337/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Antenna Systems with Randomness","volume":"7","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235394","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626337/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Antenna Systems with Randomness","sourcePdf":"tw_0809_3636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058865S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4626294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"4626294","articleId":"4626337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4626338,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4626294/4626338/4626338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao Li was born in Anhui, China, in 1982.

In this paper, a new perspective for the IEEE standard 1459-2000 definitions is introduced using the stationary wavelet transform (SWT). As a time-frequency transform, the SWT can provide variable frequency resolution while preserving time information without spectral leakage as the FFT. Moreover, unlike other time-frequency transforms, such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), SWT possesses the time-invariance property that keeps the time and frequency characteristics throughout all of the decomposition levels. Results of different case studies including stationary, nonstationary of synthetic, and real PQ disturbances proves the effectiveness of applying the SWT over FFT or DWT.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2002660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4626339/04626358.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2002660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626339","startPage":"2356","endPage":"2365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Perspective for the IEEE Standard 1459-2000 Via Stationary Wavelet Transform in the Presence of Nonstationary Power Quality Disturbance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Perspective for the IEEE Standard 1459-2000 Via Stationary Wavelet Transform in the Presence of Nonstationary Power Quality Disturbance","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626358/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235593","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626358/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Perspective for the IEEE Standard 1459-2000 Via Stationary Wavelet Transform in the Presence of Nonstationary Power Quality Disturbance","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd04-melhawary.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110487S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4626339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4626339","articleId":"4626358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626361,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Landry","affiliation":["Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's Research Institute, Varennes, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/4626339/4626361/4626361-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michel Landry (S'75\u2013M'77\u2013SM'90) was born in St.-Albert.

Compared with the SCR-based bridge type FCL, the new one is smaller in size, better in dynamic performance, and simpler in control method and control circuitry. The novel FCL is composed of a rectifier bridge-a dc-limiting reactor and one/three bypass reactor/reactors-for a single-phase/three-phase structure. The increasing speed of the fault current just after the occurrence of a fault is limited by a dc-limiting reactor, whose inductance is designed according to the response speed of the control circuit. The bypass reactors are designed in terms of the requirements of the coordination of protective relays. The source currents during limiting events are sinusoidal and do not have any harmful effects on the overall protection schemes, impedance relays, and conventional current and voltage transformers. The topologies of the proposed FCL for three-phase four-wire and three-phase three-wire power systems are investigated, respectively, in detail. Parameter design and optimization are presented. The fault and fault-mode judgment method is described briefly.

We focus on the class of linearly coded pulse trains and determine the optimum radar code according to the following criterion: maximization of the detection performance under a control on the region of achievable Doppler estimation accuracies, and imposing a similarity constraint with a prefixed radar code. This last constraint is tantamount to requiring a similarity between the ambiguity functions of the devised waveform and of the pulse train encoded with the prefixed sequence. The resulting optimization problem is nonconvex and quadratic. In order to solve it, we propose a technique (with polynomial computational complexity) based on the relaxation of the original problem into a semidefinite program. Thus, the best code is determined through a rank-one decomposition of an optimal solution of the relaxed problem. At the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the new encoding technique in terms of detection performance, region of achievable Doppler estimation accuracies, and ambiguity function.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code Design to Optimize Radar Detection Performance Under Accuracy and Similarity Constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.929657","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4652320/04626391.pdf","startPage":"5618","endPage":"5629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.929657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4652320","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Code Design to Optimize Radar Detection Performance Under Accuracy and Similarity Constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4626391/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10265482","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code Design to Optimize Radar Detection Performance Under Accuracy and Similarity Constraints","sourcePdf":"56tsp11-demaio.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084428S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4652320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4652320","articleId":"4626391","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4626422,"authors":[{"name":"Randy C.

Eigendecomposition represents one computationally efficient method for dealing with this class of problems. One major drawback of using the eigendecomposition technique is the expensive off-line computation required to calculate the optimal subspace. This off-line computational expense may preclude the use of eigendecomposition for industrial applications where time is of the essence. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a computationally efficient algorithm for estimating the eigendecomposition to a user specified accuracy. In particular, we sample the rotation group SO(3) in a manner that allows us to take advantage of the correlation in SO(3) and transform the data from the spatial domain to the spectral domain. We then present an algorithm to estimate the eigendecomposition in this domain, thus relieving the computational burden. Experimental results are presented to compare the proposed algorithm to the true eigendecomposition, as well as assess the computational savings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bridges","USA Councils","Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete transforms","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","group theory","image sampling","matrix algebra","object detection","pose estimation","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D object pose detection","image sample","discrete spherical harmonic transform","Wigner-D matrix","industrial automation application","eigendecomposition estimation","rotation group","spatial domain","spectral domain"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COASE.2008.4626422","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622934/4626395/04626422.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2008.4626422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pose detection of 3-D objects using images sampled on SO(3), spherical harmonics, and wigner-D matrices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pose detection of 3-D objects using images sampled on SO(3), spherical harmonics, and wigner-D matrices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626422/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626422/","accessionNumber":"10221127","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pose detection of 3-D objects using images sampled on SO(3), spherical harmonics, and wigner-D matrices","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"0040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071102S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622934","isNumber":"4626395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622934","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4626395","articleId":"4626422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626425,"authors":[{"name":"Gustaw Mazurek","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland"],"firstName":"Gustaw","lastName":"Mazurek","id":"37699037100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2022-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2023-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"}],"articleNumber":"4626425","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bridges","USA Councils","Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","radiofrequency identification","radiofrequency interference","signal detection","software radio","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RFID system","DS-CDMA transmission","software defined radio","signal detection","successive interference cancellation","coherent detector","environmental condition monitoring","surveillance","noncoherent detector"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we describe an experimental RFID system composed of transmitter-only active tags and a flexible reader based on the software defined radio.

As an example it can serve monitoring of environmental conditions or surveillance of valuable assets.","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2008.4626425","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622934/4626395/04626425.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2008.4626425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of RFID system with DS-CDMA transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626425/","displayDocTitle":"Design of RFID system with DS-CDMA transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10221130","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626425/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of RFID system with DS-CDMA transmission","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"0044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054653S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622934","isNumber":"4626395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622934","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4626395","articleId":"4626425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4626427,"authors":[{"name":"Azzam-ul-Asar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Pakistan","Dept of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, University of Engineering & Technology Peshawar"],"lastName":"Azzam-ul-Asar","id":"38270716600"},{"name":"M.

Instead of storing timing plans for different traffic scenarios, which requires clustering and threshold calculations, the proposed approach uses an ANN model that produces optimal plans based on optimized weights obtained through its learning phase. Clustering in closed loop system is root of the problems and has been eliminated in the proposed approach. The particle swarm optimization technique has been used both in the learning rule of ANN as well as generating training cases for ANN in terms of optimized timing plans based on highway capacity manual delay for all traffic demands found in historical data. The ANN generates optimal plans online for the real time traffic demands and is more responsive to varying traffic conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626427/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10221132","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626427/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Traffic responsive signal timing plan generation based on neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic responsive signal timing plan generation based on neural network","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"0046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075923S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4622934","isNumber":"4626395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622934","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4626395","articleId":"4626427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626486,"authors":[{"name":"Jijie Xu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Operation Research, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"lastName":"Jijie Xu","id":"38184064200"},{"name":"Vincent Duindam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Duindam","id":"37283241100"},{"name":"Ron Alterovitz","affiliation":["Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco","Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Alterovitz","id":"37320259800"},{"name":"Ken Goldberg","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Operation Research and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Goldberg","id":"37273026700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2022-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2023-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"}],"articleNumber":"4626486","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":670},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bridges","USA Councils","Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical robotics","mobile robots","needles","path planning","random processes","sampling methods","tree searching","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling-based motion planning algorithm","steerable bevel-tip needle","3D environment","rapidly-exploring random tree","backchaining","minimally invasive medical procedure","configuration space search"]}],"abstract":"Steerable needles composed of a highly flexible material and with a bevel tip offer greater mobility compared to rigid needles for minimally invasive medical procedures. In this paper, we apply sampling-based motion planning technique to explore motion planning for the steerable bevel-tip needle in 3D environments with obstacles. Based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) method, we develop a motion planner to quickly build a tree to search the configuration space using a new exploring strategy, which generates new states using randomly sampled control space instead of the deterministically sampled one used in classic RRTs. Notice the fact that feasible paths might not be found for any given entry point and target configuration, we also address the feasible entry point planning problem to find feasible entry points in a specified entry zone for any given target configuration. To solve this problem, we developed a motion planning algorithm based on RRTs with backchaining, which grow backward from the target to explore the configuration space. Finally, simulation results with a approximated realistic prostate needle insertion environment demonstrate the performance of the proposed motion planner.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion planning for steerable needles in 3D environments with obstacles using rapidly-exploring Random Trees and backchaining","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2008.4626486","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4622934/4626395/04626486.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2008.4626486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Motion planning for steerable needles in 3D environments with obstacles using rapidly-exploring Random Trees and backchaining","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626486/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10221191","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion planning for steerable needles in 3D environments with obstacles using rapidly-exploring Random Trees and backchaining","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"0148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066316S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2008","isNumber":"4626395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4622934","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4626486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626494,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Azarnasab","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Azarnasab","id":"37295592400"},{"name":"Xiaolin Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaolin Hu","id":"37087075247"},{"name":"Peiman Amini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Peiman","lastName":"Amini","id":"37394041800"},{"name":"Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Behrouz","lastName":"Farhang-Boroujeny","id":"38265010700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2022-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2023-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"}],"articleNumber":"4626494","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bridges","USA Councils","Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","digital simulation","software radio","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["progressive simulation-based design","software defined radio","engineering systems","real system realization","cognitive radio network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626494","abstract":"The increasing complexity of engineering systems and automation applications asks for systematic design processes and methodologies.

In this paper, we propose a PSO topology based on multiples rings. In this approach, the acceleration coefficients and the communication inside each ring are adjusted based on a grade, which is calculated by evaluating a fitness comparison. The diversity of the system is provided by the ring rotations. The neighborhood of each particle is defined according its grade as defined in the dispersed PSO. A comparison with star, ring and simple multi-ring topologies was performed. Our simulation results showed that the proposed topology always achieve good results when compared to other approaches.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2008.138","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626579/4626580/04626600.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2008.138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Ring Dispersed Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Equations","Indexes","Particle swarm optimization","Mathematical model","Convergence","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiring dispersed particle swarm optimization","unconstrained optimization problems","hyper dimensional spaces","velocity update equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Swarm intelligence","communication topologies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Ring Dispersed Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626600/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10234530","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Ring Dispersed Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3326a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089987S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626579","isNumber":"4626580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626579","xplore-issue":"4626580","articleId":"4626600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4626606,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

The core technology implemented behind this type of recommenders includes content analysis, collaborative filtering and some hybrid variants. Since they all have certain strengths and limitations, combining them may be a promising solution provided there is a way of overcoming a large amount of input variables especially from combining different techniques. Genetic algorithm (GA) is an ideal optimization search function, for finding a best recommendation out of a large population of variables. In this paper we presented a GA-based approach for supporting combined modes of collaborative filtering.

Preliminary tests on synthetic and real images are very promising.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2008.140","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626579/4626580/04626655.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"361","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2008.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network-Based Approach to Motion Estimation with Discontinuities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network-Based Approach to Motion Estimation with Discontinuities","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10234580","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626655/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network-Based Approach to Motion Estimation with Discontinuities","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3326a356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053735S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626579","isNumber":"4626580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626579","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4626580","articleId":"4626655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626659,"authors":[{"name":"Kuncup Iswandy","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated Sensor Systems, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Kuncup","lastName":"Iswandy","id":"37426989000"},{"name":"Andreas Koenig","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated Sensor Systems, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Koenig","id":"37275595200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3326-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4626659","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Hardware","Computational modeling","Accuracy","Training","Optimization","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","fault tolerance","intelligent sensors","particle swarm optimisation","signal classification","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant nearest neighbor classification","intelligent sensor systems","wireless sensor networks","data acquisition","mixed-signal realization","redundancy","particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable hardware","nearest neighbor classifier","particle swarm optimization","intelligent sensor system"]}],"abstract":"Low-power integrated intelligent sensor systems are of increasing interest for the efficient realization of mobile and distributed realizations. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are one possible example, where long term sensor vigilance and data acquisition and rather sporadic, brief communication phases occur. Mixed-signal realization, in particular exploiting sub-threshold implementation are interesting, but suffer from susceptibility to environmental and process parameter deviations. Redundancy and reconfiguration based on evolutionary approaches can overcome these problems and raise the yield. This is demonstrated for a behavioral model of a previously implemented one-nearest neighbor (1-NN) reconfigurable mixed-signal classifier. An eye-tracking example will be employed for the case study. Initial classifier prototypes were chosen by an iterative algorithm and the effect of increasing circuit perturbations on performance was systematically investigated. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was applied to readjust or reconfigure the prototypes to restore performance. The experiments show that the adjusting prototypes by PSO can be significantly recovered by the mean of 67% for high perturbation. The yield could be increased considerably, so that PSO and instance based reconfiguration gives broader applicability to low-power mixed-signal circuits.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2008.135","publicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626579/4626580/04626659.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2008.135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626580","startPage":"380","endPage":"385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSO for Fault-Tolerant Nearest Neighbor Classification Employing Reconfigurable, Analog Hardware Implementation in Low Power Intelligent Sensor Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PSO for Fault-Tolerant Nearest Neighbor Classification Employing Reconfigurable, Analog Hardware Implementation in Low Power Intelligent Sensor Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626659/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10234583","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSO for Fault-Tolerant Nearest Neighbor Classification Employing Reconfigurable, Analog Hardware Implementation in Low Power Intelligent Sensor Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3326a380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072048S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626579","isNumber":"4626580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626579","xplore-issue":"4626580","articleId":"4626659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4626668,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9 L.D.

Our model for short-term wind speed forecast integrates two different meteorological prediction global models, observations at surface level and in different heights using atmospheric soundings. Also, it includes a mesoscale prediction model and a neural network to obtain the wind speed forecast in an specific point of the wind park. In the experiments carried out, we present some results of wind speed forecast in two aero-generators in a wind park at the south east of Spain.

We present an algorithm which uses both techniques in a two-step procedure. The first step employs support vector machines within a one-vs-all reduction from multiclass to binary approach to obtain the distances between each observation and the support vectors representing the classes. The second step uses these distances as inputs for a neural network, built with an entropy cost function and softmax transfer function for the output layer where class membership is used for training. Consequently, this network estimates probabilities of class membership for new observations. A benchmark using different databases demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive with the most recent techniques for multiclass probability estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626704/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10234622","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626704/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid System for Probability Estimation in Multiclass Problems Combining SVMs and Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid System for Probability Estimation in Multiclass Problems Combining SVMs and Neural Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3326a649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072804S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626579","isNumber":"4626580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626579","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4626580","articleId":"4626704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626706,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Everardo B.

The resulting SOFM is expected to produce simultaneously a topologically correct mapping between input and output spaces and a low quantization error. The proposed approach adopts a cost (fitness) function which is a weighted combination of indices that measure these two aspects of the map quality, specifically, the quantization error and the Pearson correlation coefficient between the corresponding distances in input and output spaces. The resulting maps are compared with those generated by the Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm in terms of the quantization error (QE), the weighted topological error (WTE) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) indices. The experiments show the proposed approach produces better values of the quality indices as well as is more robust to outliers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626706/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626706/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10234624","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"On Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) Formation by Direct Optimization Through a Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) Formation by Direct Optimization Through a Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3326a661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066833S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626579","isNumber":"4626580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626579","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4626580","articleId":"4626706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626707,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The neural model MREM is used to solve this problem. This model has been successfully applied to other optimization problems. In this case, a slightly different version is used, in which the neuron state is represented by a two dimensional discrete vector, representing the nodes assigned to a given position in each of the parallel lines. Some experimental simulations have been carried out in order to compare the efficiency of the neural network with a heuristic approach designed to solve the problem at hand.

Determining the structure of a neural network is a very complex task and there is no defined approach to determine the structure, especially the number of hidden nodes. Traditionally the number of hidden nodes is determined by carrying out a trial and error approach and by choosing the model which gives the best results. This approach takes a significant time and effort to determine the structure of a neural network. In this paper we propose a method to determine the number of hidden nodes using the cluster validity mechanism and to determine the parameters such as center and width of a Radial Basis Neural Network (RBNN) using the fuzzy clustering algorithm. Results shows that the proposed approach gives better classification rates comparedto the traditional approach for the data sets we used. Also it gives similar classification rates when compared with the best results reported in the literature. Therefore, the proposed mechanism provides an alternative to determine the number of hidden layers and other learning parameters during the training process.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2008.150","publicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","startPage":"787","endPage":"792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2008.150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626580","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626579/4626580/04626727.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Distance measurement","Clustering algorithms","Classification algorithms","Indexes","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","pattern clustering","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter determining mechanism","radial basis neural networks","artificial intelligence","human biological neural system","hidden nodes determination","cluster validity mechanism","fuzzy clustering algorithm","classification rates","training process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy clustering","Xie-Beni's separation index"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A New Parameter Determining Mechanism for Radial Basis Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626727/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626727/","accessionNumber":"10234641","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Parameter Determining Mechanism for Radial Basis Neural Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3326a787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043558S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626579","isNumber":"4626580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626579","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4626580","articleId":"4626727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4626728,"authors":[{"name":"X.Z.

Early results show that similar foreground and background features can be discriminated using this approach.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2008.54","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626579/4626580/04626745.pdf","startPage":"899","endPage":"902","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2008.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Spatial Grammars for Drawn Documents Using Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Learning Spatial Grammars for Drawn Documents Using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10234652","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626745/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Spatial Grammars for Drawn Documents Using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3326a899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0611S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626579","isNumber":"4626580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626579","xplore-issue":"4626580","articleId":"4626745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4626746,"authors":[{"name":"Marina G.

Many algorithms have been developed since, however most static algorithms are designed in the problem domain of scheduling single workflow applications, thus not applicable to a common cluster environment where multiple workflow applications and other independent jobs compete for resources. Dynamic scheduling approaches can handle the mixed workload practically by nature but their performance has yet to optimize as they do not have a global view of workflow applications. Recent research efforts suggest merging multiple workflows into one workflow before execution, but fail to address an important issue that multiple workflow applications may be submitted at different times by different users. In this paper, we propose a planner-guided dynamic scheduling strategy for multiple workflow applications, leveraging job dependence information and execution time estimation.Our approach schedules individual jobs dynamically without requiring merging the workflow applications a priori. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms two other algorithms by 43.6% and 36.7% with respect to workflow makespan and turnaround time respectively, and it performs even better when the number of concurrent workflow applications increases and the resources are scarce.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Planner-Guided Scheduling Strategy for Multiple Workflow Applications","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Parallel Processing - Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICPP-W.2008.10","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Parallel Processing - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626764/4626765/04626773.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP-W.2008.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Planner-Guided Scheduling Strategy for Multiple Workflow Applications","conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626773/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10234666","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Planner-Guided Scheduling Strategy for Multiple Workflow Applications","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"3375a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067921S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626764","isNumber":"4626765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626764","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4626765","articleId":"4626773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4626775,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Teller","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Teller","id":"37572347200"},{"name":"F\u00fcsun \u00d6zg\u00fcner","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"F\u00fcsun","lastName":"\u00d6zg\u00fcner","id":"37296297800"},{"name":"Robert Ewing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Ewing","id":"37275598700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3375-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"4626775","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626775","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Schedules","Runtime","Field programmable gate arrays","Optimal scheduling","Computational modeling","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backtracking","directed graphs","microprocessor chips","scheduling","task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling task graphs","heterogeneous multiprocessors","reconfigurable hardware","directed acyclic task graphs","reconfigurable processing cores","mutually exclusive processor groups reconfiguration model","heterogeneous earliest finish time","back-tracking algorithm","higher quality schedules","hardware-software co-scheduler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable Computing","Heterogeneous Multiprocessor","scheduling"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of scheduling applications represented as directed acyclic task graphs (DAGs) onto architectures with reconfigurable processing cores.

Nevertheless, the high-order reconstruction filter used in each channel of SDBF makes the beamformer highly complex. The beamformer can be simplified by reconstructing the signal after the delay-andsum process with only one filter. However, this post-delay reconstruction-based design degrades image quality when dynamic focusing is performed. This paper shows that employing a simple pre-delay filter is sufficient to achieve similar performance as conventional pre-delay reconstruction SDBF, as long as the pre-delay filter provides the required pre-delay signalto- quantization noise ratio (SQNR). Based on this finding, we proposed a cascaded reconstruction beamformer that uses a boxcar filter as the pre-delay filter in each channel. Simulations using real phantom data demonstrate that the proposed beamforming method can achieve a contrast resolution comparable to that of the pre-delay reconstruction beamforming method. In addition, the hardware can be greatly simplified compared with the pre-delay reconstruction beamformers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","volume":"55","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10208533","pubMedId":"18986890","publicationDate":"September 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626922/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sigma-delta receive beamformer based on cascaded reconstruction for ultrasound imaging application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sigma-delta receive beamformer based on cascaded reconstruction for ultrasound imaging application","sourcePdf":"t0891935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081573S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4626908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4626908","articleId":"4626922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626923,"authors":[{"name":"Anup Agarwal","affiliation":["Image Computing Systems Laboratory Departments of Electrical Engineering and Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4626908/4626923/4626923-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anup Agarwal received the B.Tech.

However, it is computationally very demanding due to its requirement for multiple lowpass filters (e.g., a complex filter for each receive channel in quadrature demodulation-based phase rotation beamform- ers (QD-PRBF)). We recently developed a novel phase rotation beamformer with reduced complexity, which can lower: 1) the number of lowpass filters using 2-stage demodulation (TSD) and 2) the number of beamforming points using adap tive field-of-view (AFOV) imaging. In TSD, dynamic focusing is performed on the mixed signals, while sampling frequency of the beamformed signal (i.e., beamforming frequency) is adjusted based on the displayed field-of-view (FOV) size in AFOV imaging. In this paper, the image quality of the developed beamformer (i.e., TSD-AFOV-PRBF) has been quantitatively evaluated using phantom and in vivo data. From the phantom study, it was found that TSD-AFOV-PRBF with only 1024 beamforming points provides comparable image quality to QD-PRBF. We obtained a median contrast resolution (CR) degradation of 7.6% for the FOV size of 160 mm. Image quality steadily improves with FOV size reduction (e.g., 2.3% CR degradation at 85 mm). Similar results were also obtained from an in vivo study. Thus, TSD-AFOV-PRBF could provide comparable image quality to conventional beamformers at considerably reduced computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.886","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4626908/04626923.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"1947","endPage":"1955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image quality evaluation with a new phase rotation beamformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Image quality evaluation with a new phase rotation beamformer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626923/","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4626923/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10208534","pubMedId":"18986891","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image quality evaluation with a new phase rotation beamformer","sourcePdf":"t0891947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141891S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4626908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4626908","articleId":"4626923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4626937,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Viola","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Viola","id":"37286001100"},{"name":"William F.

We present the results of computer simulations and ultrasound experiments which indicate that the bias and the standard deviation of the proposed algorithms are comparable to those of the original method, and thus superior to other published algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626937/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10208548","pubMedId":"18986905","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient spline- based time delay estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient spline- based time delay estimation","sourcePdf":"t0892084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08935S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4626908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4626908","articleId":"4626937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4626939,"authors":[{"name":"Herv\u00e9 Liebgott","affiliation":["INSA de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5220, INSERM, CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Herv\u00e9","lastName":"Liebgott","id":"37298011200"},{"name":"Adrian Basarab","affiliation":["INSA de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5220, INSERM, CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Basarab","id":"37298011900"},{"name":"Pierre Gueth","affiliation":["INSA de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5220, INSERM, CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Gueth","id":"37704755900"},{"name":"Christian Cachard","affiliation":["INSA de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5220, INSERM, CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Cachard","id":"37298009500"},{"name":"Philippe Delachartre","affiliation":["INSA de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5220, INSERM, CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Delachartre","id":"37297990700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-3010"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1525-8955"}],"articleNumber":"4626939","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":231},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/index2.asp"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626939","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Image generation","Focusing","Array signal processing","Probes","Apertures","Fourier transforms","Transducers","Delay effects","Acoustic propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","demodulation","heterodyne detection","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lateral radiofrequency image synthesis","synthetic aperture imaging technique","synthetic transmit aperture","transmit mode","receive mode","heterodyning demodulation method","lateral radiofrequency signals","point spread function","motion estimation","ultrasound images"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Feasibility Studies","Image Enhancement","Image Enhancement","Phantoms, Imaging","Radio Waves","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Transducers","Ultrasonography","Ultrasonography"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4626908/04626939.pdf","startPage":"2097","endPage":"2103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lateral RF image synthesis using a synthetic aperture imaging technique","abstract":"The oscillating profile naturally present in ultrasound images has been shown to be extremely valuable in different applications, particularly in motion estimation. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to produce images with transverse oscillations (TOs) based on a specific type of beamforming. However, there is still a great difference between the nature of the lateral oscillations produced with current methods and the axial profile of ultrasound images. In this study, we propose to combine synthetic aperture imaging (synthetic transmit aperture, STA) using a specific beamformer in both transmit mode and receive mode combined with a heterodyning demodulation method to produce lateral radiofrequency signals (LRFs). The aim was to produce lateral signals as close as possible to conventional axial signals, which would make it possible to estimate lateral displacements with the same accuracy as in the axial direction. The feasibility of this approach was validated in simulation and experimentally on an ultrasound research platform, the Ultrasonix RP system. We show that the combination of STA and the heterodyning demodulation can divide the wavelength of the LRF signals by 4 and divide the width of the lateral envelope of the point spread function (PSF) by 2 compared with the previous approaches using beamforming in receive mode only. Finally, we also illustrate the potential of our beamforming for motion estimation compared with previous TO methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","volume":"55","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10222525","pubMedId":"18986907","publicationDate":"September 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4626939/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lateral RF image synthesis using a synthetic aperture imaging technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lateral RF image synthesis using a synthetic aperture imaging technique","sourcePdf":"t0892097.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064952S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4626908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4626908","articleId":"4626939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626941,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-hong Hu","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department and the NIH Transducer Resource Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chang-hong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37292942000"},{"name":"Qifa Zhou","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department and the NIH Transducer Resource Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qifa","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37289256500"},{"name":"K.

By and large, primary-backup approach is a common methodology used for fault tolerance wherein each task has a primary copy and a backup copy on two different processors. In this paper, we identify two cases that may happen when scheduling dependent tasks with primary-backup approach. We derive two important constraints that must be satisfied. Further, we show that these two constraints play a crucial role in limiting the schedulability and overloading efficiency of backups of dependent tasks. We then propose two strategies to improve schedulability and overloading efficiency, respectively. We propose two algorithms (MRC-ECT and MCT-LRC), to schedule backups of independent jobs and dependent jobs, respectively. MRC-ECT is shown to guarantee an optimal backup schedule in terms of replication cost for an independent task, while MCT-LRC can schedule a backup of a dependent task with minimum completion time and less replication cost. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to quantify the performance of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4766371/04626949.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766371","startPage":"380","endPage":"393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design of Fault-Tolerant Scheduling Strategies Using Primary-Backup Approach for Computational Grids with Low Replication Costs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Fault-Tolerant Scheduling Strategies Using Primary-Backup Approach for Computational Grids with Low Replication Costs","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626949/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10417120","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4626949/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Fault-Tolerant Scheduling Strategies Using Primary-Backup Approach for Computational Grids with Low Replication Costs","sourcePdf":"ttc2009030380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075474S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4766371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4766371","articleId":"4626949","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626951,"authors":[{"name":"Soontae Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4766371/4626951/4626951-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soontae Kim received the BE and ME degrees in computer science and engineering from Chung-Ang University, Korea, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer science and engineering from Pennsylvania State University in 2003.

Especially, protecting caches in current processors incurs as much as 12.5 percent area overhead due to error-correcting codes (ECCs). Considering large L2/L3 caches employed in current high-performance processors, the area overhead is very high, consuming a large number of on-chip transistors. As an attempt to reduce that overhead, this paper proposes an area-efficient error protection architecture for large L2/L3 caches. First, it selectively applies ECC to only dirty cache lines, and other clean cache lines are protected by using simple parity check codes. Second, the dirty cache lines are periodically cleaned by exploiting the generational behavior of cache lines in order not to increase traffic to the off-chip main memory. Experimental results show that the cleaning technique effectively reduces the average number of dirty cache lines per cycle. The ECCs of the reduced dirty cache lines can be confined in a small ECC array or ECC cache. Our proposed error protection architecture has been shown to reduce the area overhead of a 1-Mbyte L2 cache for error protection by 59 percent with less than 1 percent performance degradation, on the average, using SPEC2000 benchmarks running on a typical four-issue superscalar processor. A dirty cache line cleaning scheme is also beneficial for reducing the vulnerability of tag arrays to soft errors.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4766371/04626951.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766371","startPage":"300","endPage":"310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Area Overhead for Error-Protecting Large L2/L3 Caches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Area Overhead for Error-Protecting Large L2/L3 Caches","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10417117","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4626951/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Area Overhead for Error-Protecting Large L2/L3 Caches","sourcePdf":"ttc2009030300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090941S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4766371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4766371","articleId":"4626951","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626953,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4766371/4626953/4626953-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Yuan received the BS and MS degrees in computer science from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1989 and 1992, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Pittsburgh in 1998.

FRR offers better short-term fairness than stratified round robin and other existing round robin schedulers.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.176","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4766371/04626953.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766371","startPage":"365","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair Round-Robin: A Low Complexity Packet Schduler with Proportional and Worst-Case Fairness","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fair Round-Robin: A Low Complexity Packet Schduler with Proportional and Worst-Case Fairness","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10417119","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4626953/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Round-Robin: A Low Complexity Packet Schduler with Proportional and Worst-Case Fairness","sourcePdf":"ttc2009030365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10321S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4766371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4766371","articleId":"4626953","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626955,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled M.

To address the problem of modularity, flexibility and scalability, we propose a Hierarchically-distributed Peer-to-Peer (HP2PC) architecture and clustering algorithm. The architecture is based on a multi-layer overlay network of peer neighborhoods. Supernodes, which act as representatives of neighborhoods, are recursively grouped to form higher level neighborhoods. Within a certain level of the hierarchy, peers cooperate within their respective neighborhoods to perform P2P clustering. Using this model, we can partition the clustering problem in a modular way across neighborhoods, solve each part individually using a distributed K-means variant, then successively combine clusterings up the hierarchy where increasingly more global solutions are computed. In addition, for document clustering applications, we summarize the distributed document clusters using a distributed keyphrase extraction algorithm, thus providing interpretation of the clusters. Results show decent speedup, reaching 165 times faster than centralized clustering for a 250-node simulated network, with comparable clustering quality to the centralized approach. We also provide comparison to the P2P K-means algorithm and show that HP2PC accuracy is better for typical hierarchy heights. Results for distributed cluster summarization match those of their centralized counterparts with up to 88% accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2008.189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804934","startPage":"681","endPage":"698","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4804934/04626955.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2008.189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchically Distributed Peer-to-Peer Document Clustering and Cluster Summarization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Data mining","Distributed decision making","Scalability","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Distributed computing","Network topology","Communication system traffic control","Nonhomogeneous media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","distributed processing","document handling","pattern clustering","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchically distributed peer-to-peer document clustering","distributed data mining","flat node distribution","multilayer overlay network","higher level neighborhoods","distributed k-means variant","distributed document clusters","distributed keyphrase extraction algorithm","distributed cluster summarization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","Text mining","Data mining","Abstracting methods","Distributed systems"]},{"kwd":["Clustering","Text mining","Data mining","Abstracting methods","Distributed systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchically Distributed Peer-to-Peer Document Clustering and Cluster Summarization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626955/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4626955/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10520355","publicationDate":"May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchically Distributed Peer-to-Peer Document Clustering and Cluster Summarization","sourcePdf":"ttk2009050681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121655S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4804934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4804934","articleId":"4626955","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4626956,"authors":[{"name":"Charu C.

A novel method based on using a hypergraph representation of the data is proposed to deal with this very high-dimensional problem. Hypergraphs constitute an important extension of graphs which allow edges to connect more than two vertices simultaneously. A variational expectation-maximization algorithm for detecting anomalies directly on the hypergraph domain without any feature selection or dimensionality reduction is presented. The resulting estimate can be used to calculate a measure of anomalousness based on the false discovery rate. The algorithm has O(np) computational complexity, where n is the number of training observations and p is the number of potential participants in each co-occurrence event. This efficiency makes the method ideally suited for very high-dimensional settings, and requires no tuning, bandwidth or regularization parameters. The proposed approach is validated on both high-dimensional synthetic data and the Enron email database, where p > 75,000, and it is shown that it can outperform other state-of-the-art methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4758536","startPage":"563","endPage":"569","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4758536/04626961.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hypergraph-Based Anomaly Detection of High-Dimensional Co-Occurrences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4626961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4626961/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hypergraph-Based Anomaly Detection of High-Dimensional Co-Occurrences","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10401617","pubMedId":"19147882","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hypergraph-Based Anomaly Detection of High-Dimensional Co-Occurrences","sourcePdf":"ttp2009030563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102658S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4758536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4758536","articleId":"4626961","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4626998,"authors":[{"name":"Tang van To","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Assumption University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tang","lastName":"van To","id":"38164109400"},{"name":"Kotchakorn Sa-Ingthong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Assumption University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kotchakorn","lastName":"Sa-Ingthong","id":"37088050944"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3359-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4626998","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4626998","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Approximation methods","Mean square error methods","Spline","Training","Polynomials","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","backpropagation","computational geometry","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bezier triangular neural network","multilayer backpropagation neural network","surface approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bezier Triangular Surface","Neural Network","Surface Approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CGIV.2008.37","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626967/4626968/04626998.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGIV.2008.37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bezier Triangular Neural Network","abstract":"Bezier Triangular Neural Network (BTNN) is a multilayer back propagation neural network which used for surface approximation.

A hybrid image matching algorithm for image analysis is proposed and evaluated. Features are extracted using blob detectors and interest point detectors. This combination ensures sufficient correspondences in small image patches while maintaining high accuracy. Nearest neighbors are searched using hybrid spill tree in order to reduce the computational load. Applying the algorithm to tampered image detection, a novel solution is proposed utilizing the scale space information and gradient orientation information from the corresponding features. Furthermore, an order regularity of scale space between the corresponding patches and a description for object rotation are also proposed. In addition, we conducted experiments on tampered images, proving the method to be powerful.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Detectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Image matching","Image reconstruction","Cameras","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","gradient methods","image matching","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tampered image detection","image processing software","Photoshop","hybrid image matching algorithm","image analysis","feature extraction","blob detectors","interest point detectors","hybrid spill tree","computational load","scale space information","gradient orientation information"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CGIV.2008.13","publicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626967/4626968/04627003.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGIV.2008.13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tampered Image Detection Using Image Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tampered Image Detection Using Image Matching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627003/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4627003/","accessionNumber":"10221342","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tampered Image Detection Using Image Matching","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3359a174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055892S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626967","isNumber":"4626968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626967","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4626968","articleId":"4627003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4627008,"authors":[{"name":"Kussay Nugamesh Mutter","affiliation":["School of Physics, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kussay Nugamesh","lastName":"Mutter","id":"37590872800"},{"name":"Zubir Mat Jafri","affiliation":["School of Physics, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zubir Mat","lastName":"Jafri","id":"37085941136"},{"name":"Azlan Abdul Aziz","affiliation":["School of Physics, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Malaysia","School of Physics, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Azlan","lastName":"Abdul Aziz","id":"37542971300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3359-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4627008","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627008","abstract":"This paper presents a new technique of fingerprint identification using gray Hopfield neural network (GHNN) improved by run-length encoding (RLE). Gabor filter has been used for image enhancement at the stage of enrollment and vector field algorithm for core detection as a reference point. Finding this point will enable to cover most of information around the core. GHNN deals with gray level images by learning on bitplanes that represent the fingerprint image layers. For large number of images GHNN's memory needs very large storage space to cover all learned fingerprint images. RLE is a very simple and useful solution for saving the capacity of the net memory by encoding the stored weights, in which the weights data will reduce according to the repeated one. Experiments carried out on fingerprint images show that the proposed technique is useful in a number of different samples of fingerprint images in terms of converged images in quality, encoding and decoding performance.","doi":"10.1109/CGIV.2008.25","startPage":"205","endPage":"210","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626967/4626968/04627008.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGIV.2008.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Fingerprint Identification Using Gray Hopfield Neural Network Improved by Run-Length Encoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Image matching","Neurons","Encoding","Artificial neural networks","Gabor filters","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","Gabor filters","Hopfield neural nets","image enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic fingerprint identification","gray Hopfield neural network","run-length encoding","Gabor filter","image enhancement","fingerprint image layers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Fingerprint Identification","Gray Hopfield Neural Network","Run-Length Encoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Fingerprint Identification Using Gray Hopfield Neural Network Improved by Run-Length Encoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4627008/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10234757","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Fingerprint Identification Using Gray Hopfield Neural Network Improved by Run-Length Encoding","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3359a205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041318S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626967","isNumber":"4626968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626967","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4626968","articleId":"4627008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4627015,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Faidzul Nasrudin","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence Technology (CAIT), Faculty of Information Sciences and Technology, National University of Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Faidzul","lastName":"Nasrudin","id":"37687992200"},{"name":"Khairuddin Omar","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence Technology (CAIT), Faculty of Information Sciences and Technology, National University of Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Khairuddin","lastName":"Omar","id":"37297608100"},{"name":"Mohamad Shanudin Zakaria","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence Technology (CAIT), Faculty of Information Sciences and Technology, National University of Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohamad Shanudin","lastName":"Zakaria","id":"37547900200"},{"name":"Liong Choong Yeun","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence Technology (CAIT), Faculty of Information Sciences and Technology, National University of Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Liong Choong","lastName":"Yeun","id":"37701128600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3359-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4627015","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":486},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Handwriting recognition","Writing","Image segmentation","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Skeleton"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten character recognition","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten cursive Jawi character recognition","Arabic","Farsi","Urdu","Arabic characters","Jawi script"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Handwritten Character Recognition","Jawi","Optical Character Recognition","Off-line","Cursive Script"]}],"abstract":"The subject of cursive handwritten character recognition is still open to be studied because of its complex nature.

We claim that NEAT can produce ANN classifier which exhibits outstanding ability of learning from only afew training examples without sacrificing accuracy. Our empirical evaluations against the performance of state of the art statistical machine learning method such as support vector machine show that NEAT-evolved ANN classifier outperforms by an average of 9.96% higher accuracy when presented with very small training set proving its superior ability to generalize its learning.","doi":"10.1109/CGIV.2008.35","startPage":"271","endPage":"275","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4626967/4626968/04627018.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGIV.2008.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Class Recognition Using NEAT-Evolved Artificial Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Visualization","Classification algorithms","Genetics","Support vector machines","Training","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object class recognition","NEAT-evolved artificial neural network","computer vision","Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies","robust SIFT feature","descriptor histograms","art statistical machine learning","support vector machine","NEAT-evolved ANN classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NEAT","Object Class Recognition","SIFT","NeuroEvolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Object Class Recognition Using NEAT-Evolved Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4627018/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10221346","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Class Recognition Using NEAT-Evolved Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3359a271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086723S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4626967","isNumber":"4626968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4626967","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4626968","articleId":"4627018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4627128,"authors":[{"name":"Zhan Jinyu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Cheng, China"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Jinyu","id":"37087666602"},{"name":"Li Xunsheng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Cheng, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xunsheng","id":"37688108800"},{"name":"Guo Bing","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Cheng, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Bing","id":"37703245700"},{"name":"Xiong Guangze","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Cheng, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Guangze","id":"37688108500"},{"name":"Sang Nan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Cheng, China"],"firstName":"Sang","lastName":"Nan","id":"37702622700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3288-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4627128","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic cores","System-on-a-chip","Scheduling","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Testing","Evolution (biology)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","integrated circuit testing","scheduling","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test scheduling scheme","genetic algorithm","core-based SoCs","core-based system-on-chips","test access architecture","optimal test scheduling","differential evolution","self-adaptive mutation","integer linear programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential evolution","genetic Algorithm","system on chip(SoC)","test access mechanism","test scheduling."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627128","abstract":"We present a test scheduling scheme for core-based system-on-chips based on genetic algorithm.

This problem arises in a range of applications such as collaborative filtering, distributed computation of trust and reputation, monitoring and numerous other tasks, where the computing nodes would like to preserve the privacy of their inputs while performing\u00a0\u00a0a joint computation of a certain function. Although there is a rich literature in the field of distributed systems security concerning secure multi-party computation, in practice it is hard to deploy those methods in very large scalePeer-to-Peer networks. In this work, we examine several possible approaches and discuss their feasibility. Among the possible approaches, we identify a single approach which is both scalable and theoretically secure. An additional novel contribution is that we show how to compute the neighborhood based collaborative filtering, a state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithm, winner of the Netflix progress prize of the year 2007. Our solution computes this algorithm in a Peer-to-Peer network, using a privacy preserving computation, without loss of accuracy. Using extensive large scale simulations on top of real Internet topologies, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach. Asfar as we know, we are the first to implement such a large scale secure multi-party simulation of networks of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4627288/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10234931","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Peer-to-Peer Secure Multi-party Numerical Computation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peer-to-Peer Secure Multi-party Numerical Computation","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"3318a257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091375S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4627242","isNumber":"4627243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4627242","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4627243","articleId":"4627288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4627360,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, a systematic approach is presented to identify a nonlinear multi-input multi-output process using an online adaptive Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy method in order to enable its interaction analysis. For this purpose, a relative gain array (RGA) measure is used to evaluate the interaction characteristic. A new development is presented to calculate the interaction measure around the local operating point of MIMO processes based on the most recent fuzzy rule-based identified process model. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a distillation column benchmark case study in the LV-configuration.","doi":"10.1109/CACSD.2008.4627360","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Control Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624276/4627319/04627360.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD.2008.4627360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of an adaptive Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy identification approach for interaction analysis of MIMO nonlinear systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627360/","displayDocTitle":"Application of an adaptive Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy identification approach for interaction analysis of MIMO nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10234516","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4627360/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an adaptive Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy identification approach for interaction analysis of MIMO nonlinear systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4624276","isNumber":"4627319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624276","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4627319","articleId":"4627360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4627415,"authors":[{"name":"Iv\u00c1n Gonzalez-Diaz","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4660351/4627415/4627415-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz (S'07) received the Telecommunications Engineering degree from Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain, in 2005, and the MS. degree in multimedia and communications from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include video coding, motion estimation, video object segmentation, and video indexing."]},"firstName":"Iv\u00c1n","lastName":"Gonzalez-Diaz","id":"38274461400"},{"name":"Fernando Diaz-de-Maria","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4660351/4627415/4627415-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Fernando D\u00edaz-de-Mar\u00eda (M'97) received the Telecommunication Engineering degree and the Ph.D. degree from the Polytechnic University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 1991 and 1996, respectively.","Since October 1996, he has been an Associate Professor with the Department of Signal Processing and Communications, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid.

Consequently, in the last few years, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the research of novel algorithms capable of saving computations with minimal effects on the coding quality. Adaptive algorithms and particularly multipattern solutions, have evolved as the most robust general-purpose solutions owing to two main reasons: 1) real video sequences usually exhibit a wide-range of motion content, from uniform to random, and 2) a vast amount of coding applications have appeared demanding different degrees of coding quality. In this study, we propose an adaptive algorithm, called motion classification-based search (MCS), which makes use of an especially tailored classifier that detects some motion cues and chooses the search pattern that best fits them. The MCS has been experimentally assessed for a comprehensive set of selected video sequences and qualities. Our experimental results show that MCS notably reduces the computational cost up to 55% and 84% in search points, with respect to two state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining the quality.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2004917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4660351/04627415.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2004917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Multipattern Fast Block-Matching Algorithm Based on Motion Classification Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627415/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Multipattern Fast Block-Matching Algorithm Based on Motion Classification Techniques","volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301290","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4627415/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Multipattern Fast Block-Matching Algorithm Based on Motion Classification Techniques","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-diaz-2004917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122772S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4660351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4660351","articleId":"4627415","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4627417,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Jian Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chin-Yi University, Taiping, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4712535/4627417/4627417-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Jian Lin (S\u201993\u2013M\u201995) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ta-Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1986, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and control engineering from the National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1991 and 1996, respectively.","From April 1996 to July 1999, he was an Associate Professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Nan-Kai College, Nantou, Taiwan.

The major feature of the proposed SEELA is that it is based on evolutionary algorithms that can determine the number of fuzzy rules and adjust the NFIS parameters. The SEELA consists of structure learning and parameter learning. The structure learning attempts to determine the number of fuzzy rules. A subgroup symbiotic evolution is adopted to yield several variable fuzzy systems, and an elite-based structure strategy is adopted to find a suitable number of fuzzy rules for solving a problem. The parameter learning is to adjust parameters of the NFIS. It is a hybrid evolutionary algorithm of cooperative particle swarm optimization (CPSO) and cultural algorithm, called cultural CPSO (CCPSO). The CCPSO, which uses cooperative behavior among multiple swarms, can increase the global search capacity using the belief space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in predicting time series and solving nonlinear control problems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.2005935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712535","startPage":"1476","endPage":"1490","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4712535/04627417.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Self-Evolving Evolutionary Learning for Neurofuzzy Inference Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4627417/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Self-Evolving Evolutionary Learning for Neurofuzzy Inference Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370122","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Self-Evolving Evolutionary Learning for Neurofuzzy Inference Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lin-2005935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139391S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4712535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4712535","articleId":"4627417","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4627418,"authors":[{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4773438/4627418/4627418-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Faa-Jeng Lin (M\u201993\u2013SM\u201999) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1983 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1993.","From 1993 to 2001, he was an Associate Professor and then a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan. from 2001 to 2003, he was the Chairperson and a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan, where he was the Dean of Research and Development from 2003 to 2005 and the Dean of Academic Affairs from 2006 to 2007.

In the proposed AIT2FNN control system, an IT2FNN, which combines the merits of an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system and a neural network, is developed to approximate an unknown dynamic function. Moreover, adaptive learning algorithms are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem to train the parameters of the IT2FNN online. Furthermore, a robust compensator is proposed to confront the uncertainties including the approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, and higher order terms in Taylor series. To relax the requirement for the value of lumped uncertainty in the robust compensator, an adaptive lumped uncertainty estimation law is also investigated. In addition, the circle and butterfly contours are planned using a nonuniform rational B-spline curve interpolator. The experimental results show that the contour tracking performance of the proposed AIT2FNN is significantly improved compared with the adaptive type-1 FNN. Additionally, the robustness to parameter variations, external disturbances, cross-coupled interference, and frictional force can also be obtained using the proposed AIT2FNN.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.2005938","startPage":"24","endPage":"38","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4773438/04627418.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.2005938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Control of an LUSM-Based - Motion Control Stage Using an Adaptive Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Robustness","Uncertainty","Motion control","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Tracking","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","fuzzy neural nets","interpolation","linear motors","Lyapunov methods","motion control","neurocontrollers","robust control","ultrasonic motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","LUSM-based X-Y-thetas motion control stage","adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy neural network","linear ultrasonic motor","unknown dynamic function","adaptive learning algorithms","Lyapunov stability theorem","Taylor series","adaptive lumped uncertainty estimation law","nonuniform rational B-spline curve interpolator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear ultrasonic motor (LUSM)","Lyapunov stability theorem","type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS)","type-2 fuzzy neural network (T2FNN)","$X\\hbox{--}Y\\hbox{--}\\theta$ motion control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Control of an LUSM-Based <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$X\\hbox{--}Y\\hbox{--}\\theta$</tex> </formula> Motion Control Stage Using an Adaptive Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4627418/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10460182","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Control of an LUSM-Based <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$X\\hbox{--}Y\\hbox{--}\\theta$</tex> </formula> Motion Control Stage Using an Adaptive Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lin-2005938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090662S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4773438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4773438","articleId":"4627418","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4627422,"authors":[{"name":"Romano Fantacci","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e1 di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4897220/4627422/4627422-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Romano Fantacci (M'91\u2013SM'91\u2013F'05) was born in Pistoia, Italy.

In addition, the bearing fault signatures are usually subtle compared to the dominant components in the sampled stator current. Therefore, in this paper, a noise cancellation technique is used to suppress those dominant components that are not related to a potential bearing fault. The remaining components, i.e., the noise-cancelled stator current, are then closely related to the health condition of the bearing. Furthermore, it is observed that under the presence of a bearing fault, the noise-cancelled stator current displays a significant amount of degrees of uncontrolled variation in its magnitude. The uncontrolled variation is detected by observing the samples falling outside the three-sigma limits on Shewhart's control charts.

Direct conversion is a low-cost RF design that requires fewer external components in chip implementation. Nevertheless, it introduces extra RF impairments such as I-Q imbalance and dc offset in addition to frequency offset that is commonly encountered in all RF architectures. This paper proposes to do the joint least squares (LS) estimation of frequency, dc offset, I-Q imbalance, and a channel in MIMO receivers to improve performance; frequency-dependent and frequency-independent I-Q imbalances are included. Previously, RF impairments were separately estimated in MIMO receivers, which leads to inferior performance. In particular, a receiver architecture that facilitates the joint estimation of the frequency, the dc offset, the I-Q imbalance, and the channel is proposed. The LS criterion is then applied to obtain the joint estimators, with a special training-sequence design to reduce complexity. Simplified estimators on the frequency and dc offset are also proposed with almost no loss in performance. Finally, the estimators are shown through analysis to be unbiased and approach the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of interest. The analysis is verified by computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04627425.pdf","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2005989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2005989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Least Squares Estimation of Frequency, DC Offset, I-Q Imbalance, and Channel in MIMO Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Frequency estimation","MIMO","Radio frequency","Signal processing","Diversity methods","OFDM","Transmitters","Finite impulse response filter","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint least squares estimation","multiple-input-multiple-output receivers","direct-conversion radiofrequency architecture","I-Q imbalance","dc offset","training-sequence design","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct-conversion RF architecture","joint least squares (LS) estimations","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Least Squares Estimation of Frequency, DC Offset, I-Q Imbalance, and Channel in MIMO Receivers","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4627425/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645567","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Least Squares Estimation of Frequency, DC Offset, I-Q Imbalance, and Channel in MIMO Receivers","sourcePdf":"tvt-sheen-2005989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069488S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4627425","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4627426,"authors":[{"name":"Henning Zoubek","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4627426/4627426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Henning Zoubek (S'07) received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany, in 2007, where he, supervised by Prof. Mario Pacas, is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Institute of Power Electronics and Electrical Drives.","His special fields of interest include diagnosis of electrical drives, condition monitoring, and motion control."]},"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Zoubek","id":"37601270800"},{"name":"Sebastian Villwock","affiliation":["Baum\u00fcller N\u00fcrnberg GmbH, Nuremberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4627426/4627426-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Sebastian Villwock (S'05) received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering in 2003 and the Dr.Ing. degree (summa cum laude) in electrical engineering, with the dissertation \u201cIdentification methods for the automatic commissioning and condition monitoring of electrical drives,\u201d from the University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany, in 2007.","Since 2007, he has been with Baum\u00fcller N\u00fcrnberg GmbH, Nuremberg, Germany.

For non-rigid multi-mass systems with dominant mechanical resonance frequencies, the frequency response has to be calculated during the commissioning of the plant for reasons of safety and controlling. This task can be achieved by measuring two control variables of the drive which are both affected by BFs. This paper proposes that the measurement of the frequency response is a suitable strategy for detecting incipient BFs. In doing so, a two-channel analysis method for bearing damage diagnosis without additional sensors is developed. Deviations from the frequency response of the healthy state serve as indicators for a present BF. As the measurement of the two signals can be carried out during normal operation of the plant, online BF diagnosis is achieved. For the investigated two-inertia system, single-point bearing defects on the inner and outer raceways of rolling bearings and generalized roughness faults are within the scope of this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4681672/04627426.pdf","startPage":"4270","endPage":"4276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2005020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2005020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Response Analysis for Rolling-Bearing Damage Diagnosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency response","Mechanical variables control","Frequency measurement","Fault diagnosis","Fault detection","Resonance","Resonant frequency","Safety","Control systems","Rolling bearings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","electric drives","fault location","fault simulation","machine bearings","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response analysis","rolling-bearing damage diagnosis","bearing faults","two-channel analysis method","condition monitoring","electrical drives","fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bearings","condition monitoring","electrical drives","fault diagnosis","frequency response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Response Analysis for Rolling-Bearing Damage Diagnosis","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4627426/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348771","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Response Analysis for Rolling-Bearing Damage Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tie-zoubek-2005020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10879S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4627426","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4627429,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Sun","affiliation":["Electrical Machines and Drives Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4627429/4627429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhigang Sun received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

We consider a fusion sensor-network architecture where, due to the bandwidth and energy constraints, the nodes transmit quantized data to a fusion center. The fusion center provides feedback by broadcasting summary information to the nodes. In addition to saving energy, this feedback ensures reliability and robustness to node and fusion-center failures. We assume that the sensor observations follow a linear-regression model with known spatial covariances between any two locations within a region of interest. We propose a Bayesian framework for adaptive quantization, fusion-center feedback, and estimation of the random field and its parameters. We also derive a simple suboptimal scheme for estimating the unknown parameters, apply our estimation approach to the no-feedback scenario, discuss field prediction at arbitrary locations within the region of interest, and present numerical examples demonstrating the performance of the proposed methods.","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4668621/04627434.pdf","startPage":"6069","endPage":"6085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2005753","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005753","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627434","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Parameter estimation","Large-scale systems","Wireless sensor networks","Monitoring","Bandwidth","Broadcasting","Robustness","Bayesian methods","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","random processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","random-field estimation","spatially correlated data","fusion-center feedback","reliability","linear-regression model","Bayesian framework","adaptive quantization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive quantization","decentralized random-field estimation","fusion-center feedback","sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Random-Field Estimation for Sensor Networks Using Quantized Spatially Correlated Data and Fusion-Center Feedback","accessionNumber":"10313309","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4627434/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Random-Field Estimation for Sensor Networks Using Quantized Spatially Correlated Data and Fusion-Center Feedback","sourcePdf":"56tsp12-adogandzic-2005753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095547S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4627434","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4627435,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlong Cai","affiliation":["Communications Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4740190/4627435/4627435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunlong Cai (S'07) received the B.S. degree in computer science from the Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2006.","Currently, he is working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronics, University of York, U.K. His research interests include spread-spectrum communications, adaptive signal processing, multiuser detection, and multiple antenna systems."]},"firstName":"Yunlong","lastName":"Cai","id":"37595612300"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4740190/4627435/4627435-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Rodrigo C. de Lamare (S'99\u2013M'06) received the Diploma in electronic engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil, in 1998 and the M.Sc. and PhD degrees, both in electrical engineering, from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","From January 2004 to June 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Studies in Telecommunications (CETUC) of PUC-Rio and from July 2005 to January 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Signal Processing Laboratory, UFRJ.

In nonstationary wireless environments, users frequently enter and exit the system, making it very difficult for the receiver to compute a predetermined step-size. This suggests the deployment of mechanisms to automatically adjust the step-size in order to ensure good tracking of the interference and the channel. In this paper, the performance of blind CCM adaptive receivers for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems that employ stochastic gradient (SG) algorithms with variable step-size mechanisms is investigated. We propose a novel low-complexity variable step-size mechanism for blind CCM CDMA receivers. Convergence and tracking analyses of the proposed adaptation techniques are carried out for multipath channels. Finally, numerical experiments are presented for nonstationary environments, showing that the new mechanism achieves superior performance to previously reported methods at a reduced complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4740190/04627435.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2005861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Variable Step-Size Mechanism for Code-Constrained Constant Modulus Stochastic Gradient Algorithms Applied to CDMA Interference Suppression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Variable Step-Size Mechanism for Code-Constrained Constant Modulus Stochastic Gradient Algorithms Applied to CDMA Interference Suppression","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4627435/","accessionNumber":"10370409","volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Variable Step-Size Mechanism for Code-Constrained Constant Modulus Stochastic Gradient Algorithms Applied to CDMA Interference Suppression","sourcePdf":"tsp-cai-2005861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112448S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4740190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4740190","articleId":"4627435","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4627436,"authors":[{"name":"Wenlong Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan","School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Wenlong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37695707300"},{"name":"Shuxue Ding","affiliation":["Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan","School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuxue","lastName":"Ding","id":"37271955200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4627436","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Interference","Cities and towns","Covariance matrix","Digital communication","Cost function","Computer science","Matrices","Signal processing algorithms","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","array signal processing","interference suppression","search problems","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagonal loading factor","constant modulus feature","radar","sonar","beamformer","digital communication application","interference cancellation","CM error minimization","direct search algorithm","spatial filter","adaptive array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constant modulus","diagonal loading","robust beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627436","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","abstract":"The diagonal loading method is a simple and efficient method that improves the robustness of beamformers. However, determining an ideal diagonal loading factor (DLF) is not a trivial problem, one that still has not been adequately addressed. Although beamformers are widely used in radar, sonar, and many other applications, in this correspondence, we consider a beamformer used only for digital communication applications. In digital communications, user information is coded into a sequence with the constant modulus (CM) in the baseband. Obviously, if the beamformer can cancel interference sufficiently well, the outputs of the beamformer should satisfy the CM condition more precisely. Therefore, minimizing CM errors can act as a natural criterion for determining DLFs. In this correspondence, we present a cost function based on the criterion. We also propose a direct search algorithm for DLF determination by minimizing the cost function.

Under this hierarchical Bayesian modeling, data from all L tasks contribute toward inferring a posterior on the hyperparameters, and once the shared prior is thereby inferred, the data from each of the L individual tasks is then employed to estimate the task-dependent wavelet coefficients. An empirical Bayesian procedure for the estimation of hyperparameters is considered; two fast inference algorithms extending the relevance vector machine (RVM) are developed. Example results on several data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitask Compressive Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4740190/04627439.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2005866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Multitask Compressive Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4627439/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10453584","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitask Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"tsp-carin-2005866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119346S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4740190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"365","xplore-issue":"4740190","articleId":"4627439","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4627455,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew R.

Subjects engaged in a 2-D, center-out, Fitts' Law style task and performance was evaluated using several measures. Overall, head orientation commanded motion resembled mouse commanded cursor motion (smooth, accurate movements to all targets), although with somewhat lower performance. EMG commanded movements exhibited a higher average speed, but other performance measures were lower, particularly for diagonal targets. Compared to head orientation, EMG as a cursor command source was less accurate, was more affected by target direction and was more prone to overshoot the target. In particular, EMG commands for diagonal targets were more sequential, moving first in one direction and then the other rather than moving simultaneous in the two directions. While the relative performance of each user interface differs, each has specific advantages depending on the application.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4666773/04627455.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"496","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2006216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2006216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Head Orientation and Neck Muscle EMG Signals as Command Inputs to a Human\u2013Computer Interface for Individuals With High Tetraplegia","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Head Orientation and Neck Muscle EMG Signals as Command Inputs to a Human\u2013Computer Interface for Individuals With High Tetraplegia","htmlLink":"/document/4627455/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10301938","pubMedId":"18990652","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Head Orientation and Neck Muscle EMG Signals as Command Inputs to a Human\u2013Computer Interface for Individuals With High Tetraplegia","sourcePdf":"16tnsre05-mwilliams-2006216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071104S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4666773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"4666773","articleId":"4627455","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4627458,"authors":[{"name":"Kosmas Galatsis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kosmas","lastName":"Galatsis","id":"37063000800"},{"name":"Alex Khitun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Khitun","id":"37296767900"},{"name":"Roman Ostroumov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Ostroumov","id":"37428405400"},{"name":"Kang L.

This means that instead of manipulating the transform definition, we derive algorithms by manipulating the polynomial algebras underlying the transforms using one general method. The same method yields the well-known Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform (FFT) as well as general radix discrete cosine and sine transform algorithms. The algebraic approach makes the derivation concise, unifies and classifies many existing algorithms, yields new variants, enables structural optimization, and naturally produces a human-readable structural algorithm representation based on the Kronecker product formalism. We show, for the first time, that the general-radix Cooley-Tukey and the lesser known Bruun algorithms are instances of the same generic algorithm. Further, we show that this generic algorithm can be instantiated for all four types of the real DFT and the DHT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Signal Processing Theory: Cooley\u2013Tukey Type Algorithms for Real DFTs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2006152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4740190/04627463.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2006152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Signal Processing Theory: Cooley\u2013Tukey Type Algorithms for Real DFTs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4627463/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370410","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Signal Processing Theory: Cooley\u2013Tukey Type Algorithms for Real DFTs","sourcePdf":"tsp-voronenko-2006152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112509S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4740190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4740190","articleId":"4627463","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4627464,"authors":[{"name":"Luis G.

Although the BSD was proposed as a means of greatly reducing the complexity of the preprocessing stage of the SD, no study was done on how the complexity of the tree search stage could be affected by that reduced preprocessing stage. This paper shows, both analytically and through simulation, that the reduction in preprocessing complexity provided by the BSD has the side effect of increasing the complexity of its tree search stage compared to that of the SD, independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, this paper shows how sorting the columns of the frequency-selective channel matrix in the SD does not reduce the complexity of the tree search stage, contrary to what occurs in frequency-flat channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4668621/04627464.pdf","startPage":"6031","endPage":"6043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2005745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Complexity of the Sphere Decoder for Frequency-Selective MIMO Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Frequency","MIMO","Maximum likelihood estimation","Intersymbol interference","OFDM","Maximum likelihood detection","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","frequency selective surfaces","MIMO communication","signal detection","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channels","frequency-selective channels","sphere decoder complexity","signal detection","multiple-input multiple-output systems","tree search stages","preprocessing complexity","frequency-flat channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detection","frequency-selective channel","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","sphere decoder (SD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Complexity of the Sphere Decoder for Frequency-Selective MIMO Channels","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4627464/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313326","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Complexity of the Sphere Decoder for Frequency-Selective MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp12-lbarbero-2005745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095098S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4627464","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4627467,"authors":[{"name":"Effrosyni Kokiopoulou","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory LTS4, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4740190/4627467/4627467-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Effrosyni Kokiopoulou (S'05) received the Diploma degree in engineering from the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras, Greece, in 2002 and the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2005.

Most methods proposed in the literature address the consensus averaging problem by distributed linear iterative algorithms, with asymptotic convergence of the consensus solution. The convergence rate of such distributed algorithms typically depends on the network topology and the weights given to the edges between neighboring sensors, as described by the network matrix. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the convergence rate for given network matrices by the use of polynomial filtering algorithms. The main idea of the proposed methodology is to apply a polynomial filter on the network matrix that will shape its spectrum in order to increase the convergence rate. Such an algorithm is equivalent to periodic updates in each of the sensors by aggregating a few of its previous estimates. We formulate the computation of the coefficients of the optimal polynomial as a semidefinite program that can be efficiently and globally solved for both static and dynamic network topologies. We finally provide simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in accelerating the convergence of distributed consensus averaging problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial Filtering for Fast Convergence in Distributed Consensus","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2006147","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4740190/04627467.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2006147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial Filtering for Fast Convergence in Distributed Consensus","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4627467/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370378","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial Filtering for Fast Convergence in Distributed Consensus","sourcePdf":"tsp-kokiopoulou-2006147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148168S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4740190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4740190","articleId":"4627467","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4627468,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Papagiannakis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Papagiannakis","id":"37319486900"},{"name":"Dimitrios Klonidis","affiliation":["Athens Information Technology, Centre-AIT, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Klonidis","id":"37281522500"},{"name":"Alexios N.

The performances of 3L-NPC structure were improved by developing the 3L-ANPC (Active-NPC) converter which has more degrees of freedom. In this paper the switching states and the loss distribution problem are studied for different PWM strategies. A new PWM strategy is also proposed in the paper. It has numerous advantages: (a) natural doubling of the apparent switching frequency without using the flying-capacitor concept, (b) dead times do not influence the operating mode at 50% of the duty cycle, (c) operating at both high and small switching frequencies without structural modifications and (d) better balancing of loss distribution in switches.

The proposed method of the periodic input signal reconstruction (e.g. the CT primary current) is based on the modeling of the nonlinear system in a periodic steady state by a set of circular parametric operators (CPOs). This method requires coherent sampling of the measured signal that is inconvenient because of the electro-energetic system natural frequency changes. To avoid this limitation the reconstruction calculations are transferred to the spectral domain. The spectrum of the reconstructed signal is determined by means of the spectral version of the CPO (i.e. the SCPO) on the basis of the spectrum of the distorted signal. A modified discrete Fourier transform (MDFT) is used to determine the distorted signal spectrum. The MDFT is designed for the non-coherently sampled signal high accuracy spectrum analysis. The DFT modification idea consists in the adjustment of base function frequencies of the Fourier series to the analyzed signal harmonics frequencies. Some results of experiments are included.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4627503/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10234424","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of spectrum of the nonlinearly distorted periodic signals sampled non-coherently","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of spectrum of the nonlinearly distorted periodic signals sampled non-coherently","confLoc":"Lagow, Poland","sourcePdf":"032_206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063819S","chronDate":"10-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4623685","isNumber":"4627470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4623685","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4627470","articleId":"4627503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4627515,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szlosek","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Szlosek","id":"37424146700"},{"name":"Boguslaw Swiatek","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Boguslaw","lastName":"Swiatek","id":"37670617000"},{"name":"Zbigniew Hanzelka","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Hanzelka","id":"37430386700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2129-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2130-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-1428"}],"articleNumber":"4627515","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627515","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEC standards","neural nets","power engineering computing","power meters","power supply quality","voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks flickermeter","voltage fluctuations measurement","IEC 61000-4-15 standard","voltage fluctuations standardization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISNCC.2008.4627515","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623685/4627470/04627515.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International School on Nonsinusoidal Currents and Compensation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International School on Nonsinusoidal Currents and Compensation","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNCC.2008.4627515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks to voltage fluctuations measurement \u2014 neural networks flickermeter","abstract":"It can be shown, that many flickermeters do not yield credible output readings although the manufacturers declare their compliance with the requirements of standard IEC 61000-4-15 [4].

Commonly, constitutive models that have been successfully used in the past for Sn-Pb solders are used to describe the behavior of SnAgCu solder alloys. Two issues in the modeling of lead-free solders demand careful attention: 1) Lead-free solders show significantly different creep strain evolution with time, stress and temperature, and the assumption of evolution to steady state creep nearly instantaneously may not be valid in SnAgCu alloys and 2) Models derived from bulk sample test data may not be reliable when predicting deformation behavior at the solder interconnection level for lead-free solders due to the differences in the inherent microstructures at these different scales. In addition, the building of valid constitutive models from test data derived from tests on solder joints must de-convolute the effects of joint geometry and its influence on stress heterogeneity. Such issues have often received insufficient attention in prior constitutive modeling efforts. In this study all of the above issues are addressed in developing constitutive models of Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu and Sn1.0Ag0.5Cu solder alloys, which represent the extremes of Ag composition that have been mooted at the present time. The results of monotonic testing are reported for strain rates ranging from 4.02E-6 to 2.40E-3 s\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n. The creep behavior at stress levels ranging from 7.8 to 52 MPa is also described. Both types of tests were performed at temperatures of 25degC, 75degC and 125degC. The popular Anand model and the classical time-hardening creep model are fit to the data, and the experimentally obtained model parameters are reported. The test data are compared against other reported data in the literature and conclusions are drawn on the plausible sources of error in the data reported in the prior literature.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAPT.2008.2001165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6144/4627521/04627522.pdf","startPage":"622","endPage":"633","doi":"10.1109/TCAPT.2008.2001165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constitutive Behavior of Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu and Sn1.0Ag0.5Cu Alloys at Creep and Low Strain Rate Regimes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Constitutive Behavior of Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu and Sn1.0Ag0.5Cu Alloys at Creep and Low Strain Rate Regimes","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4627522/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235335","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constitutive Behavior of Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu and Sn1.0Ag0.5Cu Alloys at Creep and Low Strain Rate Regimes","sourcePdf":"tcapt-subbarayan-2001165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094507S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6144","isNumber":"4627521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6144","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4627521","articleId":"4627522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":4627532,"authors":[{"name":"Wayne Wolf","affiliation":["Tensilica, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4627531/4627532/4627532-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wayne Wolf (F'98) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 1980, 1981, and 1984, respectively.","He is Farmer Distinguished Chair and a Research Alliance Eminient Scholar with the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.

Due to recent advancements in the biomicro electromechanical system and its various applications to clinical, environmental, and military operations, the design complexity and the scale of a DMFB are expected to explode in the near future, thus requiring strong support from CAD as in conventional VLSI design. Among the multiple design stages of a DMFB, droplet routing, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner, is one of the most critical design challenges due to high complexity as well as large impacts on performance. Our algorithm first routes a droplet with higher by passibility which is less likely to block the movement of the others. When multiple droplets form a deadlock, our algorithm resolves it by backing off some droplets for concession. The final compaction step further enhances timing as well as fault tolerance by tuning each droplet movement greedily. The experimental results on hard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves over 35 x and 20 x better routability with comparable timing and fault tolerance than the popular prioritized A* search and the state-of-the-art network-flow-based algorithm, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627533/","volume":"27","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4627533/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10235444","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A High-Performance Droplet Routing Algorithm for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Performance Droplet Routing Algorithm for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tcad-cho-2003282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160757S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4627531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4627531","articleId":"4627533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4627534,"authors":[{"name":"Nishant Patil","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4627531/4627534/4627534-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nishant Patil received the B.S. degree (Honors) in electrical and computer engineering with a minor in physics from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2006.

This paper targets real-time applications which are dynamically mapped onto embedded MPSoCs, where communication happens via the Network-on-Chip (NoC) approach, and resources connected to the NoC have multiple voltage levels. We address precisely the energy- and performance-aware incremental mapping problem for NoCs with multiple voltage levels and propose an efficient technique (consisting of region selection and node allocation) to solve it. Moreover, the proposed technique allows for new applications to be added to the system with minimal in- terprocessor communication overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is very fast, and as much as 50% communication energy savings can be achieved compared to using an arbitrary allocation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.2003301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4627531/04627545.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.2003301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627531","startPage":"1866","endPage":"1879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy- and Performance-Aware Incremental Mapping for Networks on Chip With Multiple Voltage Levels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4627545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy- and Performance-Aware Incremental Mapping for Networks on Chip With Multiple Voltage Levels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4627545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235441","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4627545/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy- and Performance-Aware Incremental Mapping for Networks on Chip With Multiple Voltage Levels","sourcePdf":"tcad-chou-2003301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111278S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4627531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4627531","articleId":"4627545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4627612,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew E.

As a basis for many administration tools in modern clusters and data-centers, VM migration is desired to be extremely efficient to reduce both migration time and performance impact on hosted applications. Currently, most VM environments use the Socket interface and the TCP/IP protocol to transfer VM migration traffic. In this paper, we propose a high performance VM migration design by using RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access). RDMA is a feature provided by many modern high speed interconnects that are currently being widely deployed in data-centers and clusters. By taking advantage of the low software overhead and the one-sided nature of RDMA, our design significantly improves the efficiency of VM migration. We also contribute a set of micro-benchmarks and application-level benchmark evaluations aimed at evaluating important metrics of VM migration. The evaluations using our prototype implementation over Xen and InfiniBand show that RDMA can drastically reduce the migration overhead: up to 80% on total migration time and up to 77% on application observed downtime.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance virtual machine migration with RDMA over modern interconnects","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629212","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623687/4629185/04629212.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"High performance virtual machine migration with RDMA over modern interconnects","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629212/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sep. 2007","accessionNumber":"10234448","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance virtual machine migration with RDMA over modern interconnects","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071339S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4623687","isNumber":"4629185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4623687","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4629185","articleId":"4629212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629246,"authors":[{"name":"Ziming Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ziming","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37310743700"},{"name":"Yawei Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yawei","lastName":"Li","id":"37558922400"},{"name":"Zhiling Lan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiling","lastName":"Lan","id":"37314459500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1387-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1388-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-5244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"4629246","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Principal component analysis","Data mining","Algorithm design and analysis","Data analysis","Data models","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","principal component analysis","workstation clusters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly localization","large-scale clusters","high performance computing","root causes","feature collection","feature extraction","data analysis","principal component analysis algorithm;","outlier detection","cell-based detection algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A critical problem facing by managing large-scale clusters is to identify the location of problems in a system in case of unusual events. As the scale of high performance computing (HPC) grows, systems are getting bigger. When a system fails to function properly, health-related data are collected for troubleshooting. However, due to the massive quantities of information obtained from a large number of components, the root causes of anomalies are often buried like needles in a haystack. In this paper, we present a localization method to automatically find out the potential root causes (i.e. a subset of nodes) of the problem from the overwhelming amount of data collected system-wide. System managers can focus on examining these potential locations, thereby significantly reducing human efforts required for anomaly localization. Our method consists of three interrelated steps: (1) feature collection to assemble a feature space for the system; (2) feature extraction to obtain the most significant features for efficient data analysis by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm; and (3) outlier detection to quickly identify the nodes that are ldquofar awayrdquo from the majority by using the cell-based detection algorithm. Preliminary studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of our method for localizing anomalies in a computing environment where the nodes perform comparable tasks.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629246","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623687/4629185/04629246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629185","startPage":"322","endPage":"330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly localization in large-scale clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly localization in large-scale clusters","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629246/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2007","accessionNumber":"10234469","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4629246/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly localization in large-scale clusters","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083291S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4623687","isNumber":"4629185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4623687","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4629185","articleId":"4629246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-02"},{"_id":4629276,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Benoit","affiliation":["ENS Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Benoit","id":"37408200000"},{"name":"Yves Robert","affiliation":["ENS Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Robert","id":"37283850600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1387-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1388-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-5244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"4629276","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629276","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Complexity theory","Computational modeling","Silicon","Throughput","Round robin","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","optimisation","parallel processing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity result","throughput optimization","latency optimization","replicated workflow","data-parallel workflow","NP-hard problem","polynomial algorithm","mono-criterion mapping optimization problem","bi-criteria mapping optimization problem","scheduling strategy"]}],"abstract":"Mapping applications onto parallel platforms is a challenging problem, even for simple application patterns such as pipeline or fork graphs.

Some instances are shown to be NP-hard, thereby exposing the inherent complexity of the mapping problem. We provide polynomial algorithms for other problem instances. Altogether, we provide solid theoretical foundations for the study of mono-criterion or bi-criteria mapping optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629276","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623687/4629185/04629276.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity Results for Throughput and Latency Optimization of Replicated and Data-parallel Workflows","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Complexity Results for Throughput and Latency Optimization of Replicated and Data-parallel Workflows","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2007","accessionNumber":"10234492","htmlLink":"/document/4629276/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity Results for Throughput and Latency Optimization of Replicated and Data-parallel Workflows","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067133S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4623687","isNumber":"4629185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4623687","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4629185","articleId":"4629276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629283,"authors":[{"name":"Louis-Claude Canon","affiliation":["LORIA, INRIA, CNRS, Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Louis-Claude","lastName":"Canon","id":"37313136100"},{"name":"Emmanuel Jeannot","affiliation":["LORIA, INRIA, CNRS, Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Jeannot","id":"37273656300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1387-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1388-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-5244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"4629283","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of robustness metrics for scheduling DAGs on heterogeneous systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629283","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Schedules","Random variables","Uncertainty","Probabilistic logic","Correlation","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","scheduling","software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robustness metrics","heterogeneous systems","intuitive notion","task scheduling","directed acyclic graph scheduling"]}],"abstract":"A schedule is said robust if it is able to absorb some degree of uncertainty in tasks duration while maintaining a stable solution.

In this new topology, a current-copying circuit, e.g., a current mirror, is placed in the sensor current path to generate a mirrored image of the sensor current. The mirrored image is then measured and processed instead of the sensor current itself. The new potentiostat topology consumes very low power, occupies a very small die area, and has potentially very low noise. These characteristics make the new topology very suitable for portable or bioimplantable applications. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the new topology, we present the results of a potentiostat circuit implemented in a 0.18-mum CMOS process. The circuit converts the sensor current to a frequency-modulated pulse waveform, for which the time difference between two consecutive pulses is inversely proportional to the sensor current. The potentiostat measures the sensor current from 1 nA to 1 muA with better than 0.1% of accuracy. It consumes only 70 muW of power from a 1.8-V supply voltage and occupies an area of 0.02 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5153552/04629303.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2005927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2005927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-Mirror-Based Potentiostats for Three-Electrode Amperometric Electrochemical Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amperometric sensors","Circuit topology","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Image sensors","Biosensors","Current measurement","Pulse circuits","Mirrors","Image generation","Circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amperometric sensors","CMOS integrated circuits","electrochemical sensors","network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-mirror-based potentiostats","three-electrode amperometric electrochemical sensors","circuit topology","current-copying circuit","bioimplantable applications","portable applications","CMOS process","current-to-frequency-modulated pulse waveform","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1.8 V","power 70 muW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amperometric sensor","current mirror","electrochemical sensor","frequency compensation","potentiostat"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Current-Mirror-Based Potentiostats for Three-Electrode Amperometric Electrochemical Sensors","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4629303/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10798138","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-Mirror-Based Potentiostats for Three-Electrode Amperometric Electrochemical Sensors","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mahmadi-2005927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048692S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5153552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5153552","articleId":"4629303","onlineDate":"19 September 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4629340,"authors":[{"name":"Kieron Turkington","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4629336/4629340/4629340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kieron Turkington received the M.Eng.

In this work we extend and adapt an existing outer loop pipelining approach known as single dimension software pipelining to generate schedules for field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) hardware coprocessors. Each loop level in nine test loops is pipelined and the resulting schedules are implemented in VHDL and targeted to an Altera Stratix II FPGA. The results show that the fastest solution for all but one of the loops occurs when pipelining is applied one to three levels above the innermost loop. Across the nine test loops we achieve an acceleration over the innermost loop solution of up to seven times, with a mean speedup of 3.2 times. The results suggest that inclusion of outer loop pipelining in future hardware compilers may be worthwhile as it can allow significantly improved results to be achieved at the cost of a small increase in compile time.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2001744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4629336/04629340.pdf","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2001744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outer Loop Pipelining for Application Specific Datapaths in FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Outer Loop Pipelining for Application Specific Datapaths in FPGAs","volume":"16","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235457","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629340/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629340/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outer Loop Pipelining for Application Specific Datapaths in FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-turkington-2001744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083891S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4629336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4629336","articleId":"4629340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4629342,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Bauer","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Department of Computer Science, University of Karlsruhe, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4629336/4629342/4629342-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lars Bauer (S'05) received the M.Sc. degree in information technology from the University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2004, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Chair for Embedded Systems (CES) under Prof. Dr. J\u00f6rg Henkel.","His main research interests are extensible processors and reconfigurable computing systems with a focus on dynamically varying run-time situations and concepts that allow systems to adapt to changing requirements."]},"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37411983400"},{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Department of Computer Science, University of Karlsruhe, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4629336/4629342/4629342-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Shafique (S'07) received the M.Sc. degree in information technology from the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences in 2003.

We propose a modular special instruction composition with multiple implementation possibilities per special instruction, compile-time embedded instructions to trigger a run-time adaptation of the instruction set, and a run-time system that dynamically selects an appropriate variation of the instruction set, i.e., a situation-dependent beneficial implementation for each special instruction. We thereby achieve a better efficiency of resource usage of up to 3.0 times (average 1.4 times) compared with current state-of-the-art ASIPs, resulting in a 3.1 times (average 1.4 times) improved application performance (compared with a general purpose processor up to 25.7 times and average 17.6 times).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629342/","volume":"16","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4629342/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235459","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Resource Utilization for an Extensible Processor Through Dynamic Instruction Set Adaptation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Resource Utilization for an Extensible Processor Through Dynamic Instruction Set Adaptation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bauer-2002430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083767S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4629336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4629336","articleId":"4629342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4629343,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Vogt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4629336/4629343/4629343-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Timo Vogt (M'07) was born in 1975.

Hence, a common hardware platform that can support multiple protocols implemented or controlled by software, generally referred to as software defined radio (SDR), is essential. This paper presents a family of dynamically reconfigurable application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs) for channel coding in wireless communication systems. As a weakly programmable intellectual property (IP) core, it can implement trellis-based channel decoding in a SDR environment. It features binary convolutional decoding, and turbo decoding for binary as well as duobinary turbo codes for all current and upcoming standards. The ASIP consists of a specialized pipeline with 15 stages and a dedicated communication and memory infrastructure. Logic synthesis revealed a maximum clock frequency of 400 MHz and an area of 0.11 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n for the processor's logic using a low power 65-nm technology.

The proposed architecture employs the principle of error-resiliency to combat logic level timing errors that may arise in average-case designs in presence of process variations and/or due to overscaling of the supply voltage [voltage overscaling (VOS)] and thereby achieves power reduction. Error-resiliency is incorporated via algorithmic noise-tolerance (ANT). Referred to as input subsampled replica ANT (ISR-ANT), the proposed technique incorporates an input subsampled replica of the main sum-of-absolute-difference (MSAD) block for detecting and correcting errors in the MSAD block. Simulations show that the proposed technique can save up to 60% power over an optimal error-free system in a 130-nm CMOS technology. These power savings increase to 78% in a 45-nm predictive process technology. Performance of the ISR-ANT architecture in the presence of process variations indicates that average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the ISR-ANT architecture increases by up to 1.8 dB over that of the conventional architecture in 130-nm IBM process technology. Furthermore, the PSNR variation (sigma/mu) is also reduced by 7times over that of the conventional architecture at the slow corner while achieving a power reduction of 33%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629348/","volume":"16","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4629348/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10235454","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error-Resilient Motion Estimation Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Resilient Motion Estimation Architecture","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-varatkar-2000675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099476S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4629336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4629336","articleId":"4629348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4629349,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Sekar","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4629336/4629349/4629349-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Krishna Sekar (S'99\u2013M'05) received the B.Tech degree in computer science and engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 1999 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the University of California, San Diego, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Staff Scientist with Broadcom Corp., San Diego, where he researches and develops embedded security solutions for Broadcom chips.

For a specific application, if the use of a high-strength nonmagnetic metallic retaining sleeve is more advantageous than a nonmetallic (e.g., carbon fiber) one, one needs to evaluate the eddy-current losses due to armature reaction space and time harmonics and/or tooth ripple, as they can be significant. This problem is aggravated furthermore in fractional-slot concentrated-winding machines due to their inherent sub- and super nonsynchronous MMF harmonic components. In this paper, the impact of the number of phases is quantified to help design a lower eddy loss rotor sleeve for a high-speed surface-mounted permanent-magnet rotor machine with fractional-slot concentrated armature winding, FSPCW-SPM. The goal of this paper is to provide a general method for laying out preferred FSPCW configurations. Also, a general method for screening and choosing the optimal slot/pole combinations is presented.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.2002207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4629350/04629354.pdf","startPage":"1522","endPage":"1532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.2002207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Number of Phases on Losses in Conducting Sleeves of Surface PM Machine Rotors Equipped With Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629354/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Number of Phases on Losses in Conducting Sleeves of Surface PM Machine Rotors Equipped With Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings","volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235408","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629354/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Number of Phases on Losses in Conducting Sleeves of Surface PM Machine Rotors Equipped With Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings","sourcePdf":"tia-elrefaie-2002207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080929S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4629350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4629350","articleId":"4629354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4629359,"authors":[{"name":"Laxman Maharjan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4629350/4629359/4629359-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Laxman Maharjan (S'06) was born in Lalitpur, Nepal, on January 2, 1979.

A function that defines the relation between a given capacitor power and its corresponding capacitance is determined using a set of training data.

The barrier prevents downward arc motion, has a stabilizing effect on the arcs, and produces a strong horizontal plasma cloud flow. It also produces shorter arc lengths, higher arcing currents and higher maximum incident energy density, when compared with the standard arrangement presently used. The erosion of the copper electrodes is much higher when a barrier is used, which causes a much larger quantity of copper spray to be directed toward the outside of the box. Similar results can be observed when vertical conductors are terminated in real industrial components. The effect of the barrier and the source X/R on arc sustainability at 208 V has also been studied. The barrier test arrangement is believed to be more representative of real-world equipment. It is proposed that an arrangement like this should be incorporated into future revisions of the IEEE 1584 testing standard.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.2002176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.2002176","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4629350/04629377.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Insulating Barriers in Arc Flash Testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Insulating Barriers in Arc Flash Testing","volume":"44","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235422","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4629377/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Insulating Barriers in Arc Flash Testing","sourcePdf":"tia-wilkins-2002176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071346S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4629350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4629350","articleId":"4629377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4629393,"authors":[{"name":"Silverio Bolognani","affiliation":["Department of Technique and Management of Industrial Systems, University of Padova, Vicenza, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4629350/4629393/4629393-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Silverio Bolognani (M'76) was born in Trento Province, Italy.

The use of voltage sensors may be eschewed if the reference voltage signals, generated by the control algorithm, can be used instead. To this aim, an accurate compensation of most of inverter nonidealities is essential. This paper presents a novel self-commissioning procedure for the cancellation of inverter nonidealities, based on repetitive control. The main advantage is that the compensation generated by the procedure automatically includes the insulated-gate bipolar transistor parasitic effects during current zero-crossing, whose exact knowledge is one of the major problems in most of the standard dead-time cancellation techniques. Despite its elaborated theoretical background, the method requires few computational resources, and it is easy to implement. Mathematical developments, design hints, and an extensive batch of successful experimental tests are included in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629393/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2008","volume":"44","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235424","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4629393/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Repetitive-Control-Based Self-Commissioning Procedure for Inverter Nonidealities Compensation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repetitive-Control-Based Self-Commissioning Procedure for Inverter Nonidealities Compensation","sourcePdf":"tia-zigliotto-2002280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090797S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4629350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4629350","articleId":"4629393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4629407,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Our novel methods incorporate new non-GPS OFDM based geometric aided routing protocols utilizing upon observable time difference of arrival via OFDM physical layer transceiver nodes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM location-based routing protocols in ad-hoc networks","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Wireless Hive Networks Conference","doi":"10.1109/WHNC.2008.4629490","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Wireless Hive Networks Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4623686/4629479/04629490.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHNC.2008.4629490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629479","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"OFDM location-based routing protocols in ad-hoc networks","conferenceDate":"7-8 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629490/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10234444","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM location-based routing protocols in ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"kelleyWHNC08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079905S","chronDate":"7-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4623686","isNumber":"4629479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4623686","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4629479","articleId":"4629490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4629494,"authors":[{"name":"Fan-Min Li","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4629336/4629494/4629494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fan-Min Li received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2000, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2007.","His research interests include the VLSI architecture design, communication systems, and speech signal processing."]},"firstName":"Fan-Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37274933800"},{"name":"Cheng-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4629336/4629494/4629494-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Hung Lin received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2002, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2004.

In this paper, we systematically analyze the timing charts of both the Viterbi algorithm and the MAP algorithm. Then, three techniques, including Distribution, Pointer, and Parallel schemes, are introduced; they can be used as flexible tools in timing-chart analysis to either reduce memory size or to increase throughput rate. Furthermore, we propose a tile-based methodology to analyze the key features of timing charts, such as computing/memory units and hardware utilization. On the basis of the timing analysis, we developed a VA/MAP timing chart that has three modes (VA mode, MAP mode, and concurrent VA/MAP mode) by complementing the idle time of both VA and MAP decoding procedures. The new combined timing analysis helps us for constructing a unified component decoder with near 100% utilization rate of the processing element (PE) in both VA/MAP decoding functions. According to the triple-mode VA/MAP timing chart, we construct a triple-mode FEC kernel that can perform both Convolutional/Turbo decoding functions seamlessly for different communication systems. By integrating the FEC kernel with different size of memory, we can construct four types of FEC decoders for different application scenarios, such as 1) standalone Convolutional decoder (VA mode); 2) standalone Turbo decoder (MAP mode); 3) dual- mode Convolutional/Turbo decoder (VA mode and MAP mode); and 4) triple-mode Convolutional/Turbo decoder (VA mode, MAP mode, and concurrent VA/MAP mode). Finally, a prototyping FEC kernel processor that is compliant to 3GPP standard is verified in TSMC 0.18-mum CMOS process in the type of triple-mode FEC decoder.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4629336/04629494.pdf","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Convolutional/Turbo Decoder Design Using Tile-Based Timing Analysis of VA/MAP Kernel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Timing","Kernel","Convolutional codes","Prototypes","Code standards","Turbo codes","Algorithm design and analysis","Viterbi algorithm","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","forward error correction","maximum likelihood estimation","turbo codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified convolutional-turbo decoder design","tile-based timing analysis","VA-MAP kernel","forward-error-correction","Viterbi algorithm","MAP algorithm","timing-chart analysis","standalone convolutional decoder","standalone turbo decoder","dual-mode convolutional-turbo decoder","triple-mode convolutional-turbo decoder","FEC kernel processor","3GPP standard","size 0.18 micron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional code","forward-error-correction code","log-MAP","maximum a-posteriori probability","reconfigurable FEC architecture","turbo code","Viterbi algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2008","displayDocTitle":"Unified Convolutional/Turbo Decoder Design Using Tile-Based Timing Analysis of VA/MAP Kernel","volume":"16","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4629494/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235456","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Convolutional/Turbo Decoder Design Using Tile-Based Timing Analysis of VA/MAP Kernel","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi07-wu-2000514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079112S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4629336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4629336","articleId":"4629494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629502,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00c9lio Fonseca Barbosa","affiliation":["Research and Development (R&D) Division, France Telecom, Lannion, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4669925/4629502/4629502-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["C\u00e9lio Fonseca Barbosa (M'08) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1983 and 1988, respectively.","In 1984, he joined the nationwide Brazilian telecommunication operator (Telebr\u00e1s), where he was in charge of developing the operator's standards and laboratories on electrical protection, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), and safety.

Inherent in its design is a true time delay phase shift capability that is independent of frequency and removes the need for costly phase shifters to steer a beam over wide angles. The Rotman Lens has a long history in military radar, but it has also been used in communication systems. This article uses the developed software to design and analyze a microstrip Rotman Lens for the Ku band. The initial lens design will come from a tool based on geometrical optics (GO). A second stage of analysis will be performed using a full wave finite difference time domain (FDTD) solver. The results between the first-cut design tool and the comprehensive FDTD solver will be compared, and some of the design trades will be explored to gauge their impact on the performance of the lens.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","volume":"9","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10313115","publicationDate":"December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629522/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rotman lens design and simulation in software [Application Notes]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotman lens design and simulation in software [Application Notes]","sourcePdf":"09mmm06-appnotes4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057229S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"4629505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4629505","articleId":"4629522","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4629523,"authors":[{"name":"Malgorzata Celuch","affiliation":["Institute of Radioelectronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Malgorzata","lastName":"Celuch","id":"37398130500"},{"name":"Wojciech K.

For this purpose, an on-line identification approach based on an adaptive neural network with growing and pruning radial basis function (GAP-RBF) structure is used for affine modeling. Also, some desired modifications in the neurons growing and pruning criteria of the original GAP-RBF algorithm has been proposed to enhance its performance in on-line identification. The proposed control scheme is evaluated via a highly nonlinear and time-varying continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) benchmark problem. The simulation results show the excellent performance of the developed adaptive control scheme for identification and control of the CSTR process.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2008.4629625","startPage":"571","endPage":"576","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624241/4629552/04629625.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2008.4629625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new adaptive neural network control scheme based on feedback linearization technique for nonlinear processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","USA Councils","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete time systems","feedback","linearisation techniques","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural network control scheme","feedback linearization technique","nonlinear processes","discrete-time adaptive control scheme","control single-input single-output processes","time-varying characteristics","affine model","on-line identification approach","pruning radial basis function","GAP-RBF","continuous stirred tank reactor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive neural network control scheme based on feedback linearization technique for nonlinear processes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629625/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235176","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive neural network control scheme based on feedback linearization technique for nonlinear processes","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060526S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4624241","isNumber":"4629552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4624241","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4629552","articleId":"4629625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629632,"authors":[{"name":"Semiha Turkay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Semiha","lastName":"Turkay","id":"37397222700"},{"name":"Huseyin Akcay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Akcay","id":"37350492700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2222-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2223-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"4629632","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","USA Councils","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","damping","optimal control","suspensions (mechanical components)","tyres"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tire damping","half-car active suspensions","random road inputs","road excitation","first-order linear shape filter","white-noise input;","temporal correlation","second order Pade filter","root-mean-square responses"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629632","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2008.4629632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2008.4629632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629552","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4624241/4629552/04629632.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Tire Damping on the H<sub>2</sub> Optimally Designed Half-Car Active Suspensions","abstract":"In this paper, the rms responses of the heave and pitch accelerations, the suspension travels, and the tire deflections of a half-car model excited by random road inputs are studied.

Some of these components have more advanced functionalities, such as a combination of filter and balun, or a complete front-end module with balun, filter, and matching network. At the same time, advanced methodologies have also been developed to design these components [29]. All the enjoyment of miniaturized RF components or modules is due to the promising three-dimensional design flexibility of LTCC technology. It is expected that a variety of functionally complex components will be continuously available on the market such that the cost and size of the overall wireless terminal can be further reduced. Various aspects of designing miniaturized LTCC LC filters have been briefly discussed here. Conventional coupled LC resonators are commonly used in LTCC filters for RF applications because of their compact size advantage. The shunted parallel resonator in this type of filter can be realized directly as a lumped-element or distributed quarter- wavelength stripline with or without loaded capacitors. Filters with distributed resonators in general have better passband insertion loss performance. Moreover, there are many ways to improve the rejection performance in an LTCC filter design; for example, by modifying the resonators or admittance inverters so as to introduce transmission zeros at the stopband. It was demonstrated, through a design example, that by making use of the flexibility of LTCC technology, a compact LC bandpass filter can be realized for various RF applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-temperature cofired ceramic LC filters for RF applications [Applications Notes]","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2008.927634","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/4622304/04629712.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2008.927634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4622304","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Low-temperature cofired ceramic LC filters for RF applications [Applications Notes]","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4629712/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-temperature cofired ceramic LC filters for RF applications [Applications Notes]","sourcePdf":"66_09mmm05-appnotes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106244S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"4622304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4622304","articleId":"4629712","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4629721,"authors":[{"name":"Dragomir Radev","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Dragomir Radev","Dragomir Radev is an associate professor at the School of Information and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan.

This introduces certain challenges that are unique to this particular application scenario, in addition to existing challenges in tracking like pose and illumination variations, occlusion, clutter and sensor noise. For this purpose, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework by combining short term feature correspondences across the cameras with long-term feature dependency models. The overall solution strategy involves adapting the similarities between features observed at different cameras based on the long-term models and finding the stochastically optimal path for each person. For modeling the long-term interdependence of the features over space and time, we propose a novel method based on discriminant analysis models. The entire process allows us to adaptively evolve the feature correspondences by observing the system performance over a time window, and correct for errors in the similarity estimations. We show results on data collected by two large camera networks. These experiments prove that incorporation of the long-term models enable us to hold tracks of objects over extended periods of time, including situations where there are large ldquoblindrdquo areas. The proposed approach is implemented by distributing the processing over the entire network.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2008.925992","startPage":"582","endPage":"596","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4629863/04629865.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2008.925992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Tracking in A Camera Network: A Multi-Objective Optimization Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Cameras","Lighting","Error correction","Stochastic processes","Stochastic systems","Bismuth","System performance","Data analysis","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","optimisation","stochastic processes","tracking","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust object tracking","video camera","multiobjective optimization framework","stochastic process","discriminant analysis model","feature estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Camera network","Long-term feature models","Multi-objective optimization","Stochastic adaptive strategies","Tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust Tracking in A Camera Network: A Multi-Objective Optimization Framework","volume":"2","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4629865/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10235476","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Tracking in A Camera Network: A Multi-Objective Optimization Framework","sourcePdf":"jstsp-song-925992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067731S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4629863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4629863","articleId":"4629865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4629896,"authors":[{"name":"Luciano Musa","affiliation":["Physics Department, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Musa","id":"37268533400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629896","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1400},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","beam handling techniques","booster injectors","CMOS integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","high energy physics instrumentation computing","nuclear electronics","particle accelerators","particle detectors","readout electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","high energy physics","CERN","European Organization for Nuclear Research","particle accelerator","multicomponent detector","very deep submicron CMOS","ASIC","semiconductor industry","intrinsic radiation tolerance"]}],"abstract":"CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is the worldpsilas largest particle physics centre. It provides state-of-the-art scientific facilities to use in exploring what matter is made of, and what forces hold it together. Observing phenomena at the subatomic level requires extraordinary instruments, particle accelerators and particle detectors. In a particle accelerator, beams of subatomic particles are boosted to nearly the speed of light and then brought into collision with either a stationary target or another beam of accelerated particles coming head-on. Each of these collisions is called an event. Each event is very complex since lots of particles are produced. In order to look for these various particles and decay products, multi-component detectors that study different aspects of an event are built around the collision point. Each component of a modern detector is used for measuring particle energies and momentum, and/or distinguishing different particle types. Most modern particle detectors produce tiny electrical signals that can be treated and recorded as computer data. Detectors in high-energy physics characteristically produce great quantities of data, whose acquisition, reduction and interpretation have made up a significant component of the experimental effort both technically and financially. For the past 60 years, the historic advances in elementary particle physics are linked to the progress in accelerator and detector technologies, as well as in the associated readout electronics technologies. Owing to the continuous evolution in the semiconductor industry, the front-end and readout electronics for High Energy Physics have been evolving to satisfy decade after decade the increasing demands of the experiments. Very deep submicron CMOS FPGAs not only offer speed, density, computational power and flexibility, but also intrinsic radiation tolerance. ASICs and FPGAs are largely used in many different areas in High Energy Physics: controls, monitoring, signal processing, data compression, high-speed data links, online reconstruction and selection of the collision events. This contribution aims at reviewing the important role that FPGAs play in modern High Energy Physics Experiments by presenting some of the most advanced and peculiar applications of FPGAs at CERN.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629896","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629896.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGAS in high energy physics experiments at CERN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629896/","displayDocTitle":"FPGAS in high energy physics experiments at CERN","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250247","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629896/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGAS in high energy physics experiments at CERN","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"K2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031939S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4629899,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Danek","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Institute of Information Theory and Automation, UTIA AV CR, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Danek","id":"37685433900"},{"name":"Jiri Kadlec","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Institute of Information Theory and Automation, UTIA AV CR, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Kadlec","id":"37337507900"},{"name":"Roman Bartosinski","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Institute of Information Theory and Automation, UTIA AV CR, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Bartosinski","id":"37298721400"},{"name":"Lukas Kohout","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Institute of Information Theory and Automation, UTIA AV CR, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Kohout","id":"37689133800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629899","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Pipelines","Runtime","Data processing","Clocks","Multithreading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encapsulation","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based designs","abstraction level","hardware description languages","functional simulation","post-place-and-route simulation","multithreading","object composability","encapsulation","partial runtime reconfiguration"]}],"abstract":"Traditional design techniques for FPGAs are based on using hardware description languages, with functional and post-place-and-route simulation as a means to check design correctness and remove detected errors.

However, performance characteristics and reconfigurable logic resource utilization of different network on chip architectures vary greatly relative to bus architectures. Current mainstream FPGA parts only support very small network on chip topologies, due to the high resource utilization of virtual channel based implementations. This observation is reflected in related research where only modest 2times2 or 2times3 networks are demonstrated on FPGAs. Naively it would be assumed that these complex network on chip architectures would perform better than simplified implementations. We show this assumption to be incorrect under light network loading conditions across 3 separate application domains. Using statistical based network loading, a synthetic benchmarking application, a cryptographic accelerator, and a 802.11 transmitter are each demonstrated across network on chip architectures. From these experiments, it can be seen that network on chips with complex routing and switching functionality are still useful under high network loading conditions. Additionally, it is also shown for our network on chip implementations, a simple solution that uses 4-5times less logic resources can provide better network performance under certain conditions.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629905","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629905.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Exploring FPGA network on chip implementations across various application and network loads","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250255","htmlLink":"/document/4629905/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring FPGA network on chip implementations across various application and network loads","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"M1C_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067468S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4629908,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Schumacher","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Schumacher","id":"37265548000"},{"name":"Pradip Jha","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pradip","lastName":"Jha","id":"37345860400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629908","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Estimation","Optimization","Table lookup","Random access memory","Hardware","Flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","RTL-based design","Xilinx PlanAhead 10.1"]}],"abstract":"FPGAs have become complex, heterogeneous platforms targeting a multitude of different applications.

This high performance comes from (1) high parallelism in applications in image processing, (2) high ratio of 8 bit operations, and (3) a large number of internal memory banks on FPGAs which can be accessed in parallel. In the recent micro processors, it becomes possible to execute SIMD instructions on 128 bit data in one clock cycle. Furthermore, these processors support multi-cores and large cache memory which can hold all image data for each core. In this paper, we compare the performance of FPGAs with those processors using three applications in image processing; two-dimensional filters, stereo-vision and k-means clustering, and make it clear how fast is an FPGA in image processing, and how many hardware resources are required to achieve the performance.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629911.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How fast is an FPGA in image processing?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"How fast is an FPGA in image processing?","htmlLink":"/document/4629911/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10221722","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How fast is an FPGA in image processing?","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"M2B_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072416S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4629913,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Bowen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Bowen","id":"37697788800"},{"name":"Christos-Savvas Bouganis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos-Savvas","lastName":"Bouganis","id":"37299183200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629913","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":747},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629913","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Strontium","Image resolution","Random access memory","Algorithm design and analysis","Real time systems","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image super resolution","FPGA","weighted mean super-resolution algorithm","multi-frame super-resolution algorithm","HDTV"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629913","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629913.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time image super resolution using an FPGA","abstract":"Image super resolution is the process of combining a set of overlapping low-resolution images to produce a single high-resolution image.

A few alternative interconnection network architectures have been proposed for future FPGAs, but they still have several design challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose sFPGA, a scalable FPGA architecture, which is a hybrid between hierarchical interconnection and network-on-chip. The logic resources in sFPGA are organized into an array of logic tiles. The tiles are connected by a hierarchical network of switches, which route data packets over the network. In addition, we have proposed a design flow for sFPGA which integrates current design flows seamlessly. By doing a case study in our emulation prototype, we have validated our sFPGA design flow.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629914.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"sFPGA \u2014 A scalable switch based FPGA architecture and design methodology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Switches","Field programmable gate arrays","Timing","Routing","Computer architecture","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable switch based FPGA","sFPGA design flow","current mesh-based FPGA","interconnection networks","logic capacity","network-on-chip","logic resources","logic tiles array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"sFPGA \u2014 A scalable switch based FPGA architecture and design methodology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629914/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250257","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"sFPGA \u2014 A scalable switch based FPGA architecture and design methodology","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"M2C_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064157S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629915,"authors":[{"name":"Pongstorn Maidee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Pongstorn","lastName":"Maidee","id":"37300457900"},{"name":"Nagib Hakim","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nagib","lastName":"Hakim","id":"37268209300"},{"name":"Kia Bazargan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Kia","lastName":"Bazargan","id":"38534813500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629915","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629915","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Random access memory","Gaussian distribution","Vectors","Computer architecture","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","specialized blocks","field-programmable gate array","family selection process"]}],"abstract":"Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have gained wide acceptance among low- to medium-volume applications. However, there are gaps between FPGA and custom implementations in terms of area, performance and power consumption. In recent years, specialized blocks - memories and multipliers in particular - have been shown to help reduce this gap. However, their usefulness has not been studied formally on a broad spectrum of designs. As FPGAs are prefabricated, an FPGA family must contain members of various sizes and combinations of specialized blocks to satisfy diverse design resource requirements. We formulate the family selection process as an ldquoFPGA family compositionrdquo problem and propose an efficient algorithm to solve it. The technique was applied to an architecture similar to Xilinx Virtex FPGAs. The results show that smart composition technique can reduce the expected silicon area up to 55%. The benefit of providing multiplier blocks in FPGAs is also shown to reduce total area by 20% using the proposed algorithm.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629915.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629915","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA family composition and effects of specialized blocks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA family composition and effects of specialized blocks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629915/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4629915/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10221724","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA family composition and effects of specialized blocks","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"M2C_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077472S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4629916,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The delay detectors enable simultaneous measurement of critical path candidates to partition all critical paths into segments. The number of measurement to choose fastest paths on all critical paths does not depends on configurations but on FPGA architectures.

The key novel feature is a technique that, for any given regex, constructs an NFA that processes multiple characters per clock cycle. An efficient algorithm is proposed that outputs an NFA which processes twice the number of characters as the input one. A technique is also proposed that implements the range match operation (e.g. [a-z]) efficiently. A program has been written that implements above ideas to convert regexes into NFAs specified in a structural hardware design language (HDL), which are then mapped onto a FPGA. Performance is evaluated using real world regexes (Snort ruleset). The results demonstrate the practical utility of the approach. For example, for a set of 2,691 regexes, while the standard 1-character NFA obtains a throughput of 1.25 Gbps, our 4-character NFA achieves a throughput of 3.63 Gbps, while requiring only 20% more LUTs and 6% less flip-flops.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629920","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629920.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed regular expression matching engine using multi-character NFA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629920/","displayDocTitle":"High-speed regular expression matching engine using multi-character NFA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250262","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629920/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed regular expression matching engine using multi-character NFA","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"M3B_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059189S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629928,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, UK"],"lastName":"Qiang Liu","id":"37290889900"},{"name":"George A.

The relevance of decimal arithmetic has become evident with the revision of the IEEE-754 standard to include decimal floating-point support. There are already a variety of IP cores available for implementing binary arithmetic accelerators in FPGAs. Thus far, however, little work has been done with regard to implementing cores that work with decimal arithmetic. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to the design of a decimal multiplier in FPGA using the embedded arithmetic blocks and a novel method for binary to BCD conversion. The proposed circuits were implemented in a Xilinx Virtex 4sx35ff877-12 FPGA. The results indicate that the proposed binary to BCD converter is more efficient than the traditional shift and add-3 algorithm and that the proposed decimal multiplier is very competitive when compared to decimal multipliers implemented with direct manipulation of BCD numbers.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629931","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629931.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decimal multiplier on FPGA using embedded binary multipliers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Decimal multiplier on FPGA using embedded binary multipliers","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4629931/","accessionNumber":"10250272","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decimal multiplier on FPGA using embedded binary multipliers","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"T1B_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065989S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4629932,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Bauer","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37411983400"},{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"Jorg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629932","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Hardware","Registers","Connectors","Parallel processing","Containers","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","instruction sets","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computation infrastructure","communication infrastructure","modular special instructions","dynamically reconfigurable processor","reconfigurable instruction set","application specific instruction set processors","monolithic special instructions","general purpose processor","H.264 video encoder","FPGA-based prototype"]}],"abstract":"Processors with a reconfigurable instruction set combine the performance of dedicated application accelerators with a flexibility that goes beyond that of traditional application specific instruction set processors (ASIPs). The latter are optimized for certain application domains and thus typically do not provide a high performance and/or efficiency when deployed in other domains. State-of-the-art reconfigurable processors on the other side still use the concept of monolithic Special Instructions (SIs, i.e. the application accelerators). In our work, we instead present modular SIs as a hierarchy of elementary data paths and different SI implementations that facilitate a high flexibility and performance. This is a novel concept that achieves a speedup of 26.6x compared to a general purpose processor and 1.24x compared to a state-of-the-art reconfigurable processor (that is statically optimized for the predetermined benchmark situation) when executing an H.264 video encoder. We introduce a novel infrastructure for computation and communication that actually enables the implementation of modular SIs and offers various parameters to match specific requirements. The infrastructure is implemented and tested on an FPGA-based prototype to demonstrate its feasibility.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629932","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629932.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","startPage":"203","endPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computation- and communication- infrastructure for modular special instructions in a dynamically reconfigurable processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A computation- and communication- infrastructure for modular special instructions in a dynamically reconfigurable processor","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629932/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250273","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4629932/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computation- and communication- infrastructure for modular special instructions in a dynamically reconfigurable processor","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"T1C_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052486S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4629935,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Lam","affiliation":["Elec. and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lam","id":"37591214900"},{"name":"Steven J.E.

This paper shows that each bit of a fixed-point exponential random variate is an independent Bernoulli variate, allowing the bits to be generated in parallel. This parallelism is of little interest in software, but is particularly well suited to FPGA generators, where huge numbers of independent uniform bits can be cheaply generated per cycle. Two generation architectures are developed using this approach, one using only logic elements to generate individual bits, and another using block-RAMs to group multiple bits together. The two methods are evaluated at three different quality-resource trade-offs, and when compared to existing methods have both higher performance and better resource utilisation. The method is particularly useful for very high performance applications, as extremely high-quality 36-bit exponential variates can be generated at 600MHz in the Virtex-4 architecture, using just 880 slices and no block-RAMs or embedded DSP blocks.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629938","startPage":"239","endPage":"244","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629938.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling from the exponential distribution using independent Bernoulli variates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629938/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sampling from the exponential distribution using independent Bernoulli variates","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629938/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10250276","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling from the exponential distribution using independent Bernoulli variates","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"T2B_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057376S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4629939,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Fischer","affiliation":["Laboratoire Hubert Curien, UMR CNRS 5516, Universit\u00e9 Jean Monnet, Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37325929300"},{"name":"Florent Bernard","affiliation":["Laboratoire Hubert Curien, UMR CNRS 5516, Universit\u00e9 Jean Monnet, Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Bernard","id":"37690826500"},{"name":"Nathalie Bochard","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Multimedia Communications, Technical University of Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Bochard","id":"37694853300"},{"name":"Michal Varchola","affiliation":["Laboratoire Hubert Curien, UMR CNRS 5516, Universit\u00e9 Jean Monnet, Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Varchola","id":"37694851900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629939","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Clocks","Logic gates","Ring oscillators","Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","cryptographic protocols","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","oscillators","random number generation","timing jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ring oscillator-based TRNG","FPGA","true random number generators","security enhancement","cryptographic protocols","field programmable gate arrays","timing jitter","random jitter","behavioural VHDL model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629939","abstract":"Random number generators are one of basic cryptographic primitives used in cryptographic protocols.

FPGAs permit the realtime implementation of the CORDIC algorithm which offers an efficient solution for an accurate phase detection, provided that the signal is available as an analytic signal. Different architectures for generating analytic signals by approximating the Hilbert transform were analyzed. Thereby, the focus has been on the demands based on the PLL application and the efficient implementation on FPGAs. Two methods were implemented using either FIR or complex filters. The FIR method results in a remaining phase error that has a zero mean value in time domain. An efficient IIR low-pass structure is proposed to suppress this phase error. The complex filters were implemented using a novel method based on complex, multiplier-less frequency sampling filters. Structures with different complexities are presented. A better result was achieved compared to a standard IIR filter design.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629940","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629940.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital hilbert transformers for FPGA-based phase-locked loops","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Digital hilbert transformers for FPGA-based phase-locked loops","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629940/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250278","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital hilbert transformers for FPGA-based phase-locked loops","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"T2B_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072654S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4629944,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In our approach to mitigate this problem, the concepts of variables and process control are brought into the FPGA hardware domain. Declarations made in the design environment are translated into logic inserted automatically into the hardware implementation. Variables provide full read/write access to hardware signals during runtime, complete with same-cycle, dynamically definable assertion checking. System data is cached via attached DRAM, providing deep variable history and the ability to ldquorewindrdquo system state. Process execution can also be controlled by the user manually or through the declaration of breakpoints. All debugging controls are available via a remote graphical user interface, which also supports back-annotation in the input design for improved data visibility and comprehension. Empirical examples have shown the logic overhead for the above functionality to be approximately 66 slices per 16-bit variable with full assertion checking on a Virtex-II Pro device, plus the fixed requirements of the debug controller and memory interface.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629950","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629950.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated debugging environment for FPGA computing platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629950/","displayDocTitle":"An integrated debugging environment for FPGA computing platforms","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629950/","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250286","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated debugging environment for FPGA computing platforms","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"T4A_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059671S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629953,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Kaganov","affiliation":["Quantitative Research, Algorithmics Incorporated, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Kaganov","id":"37694760000"},{"name":"Paul Chow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Chow","id":"37266119000"},{"name":"Asif Lakhany","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Asif","lastName":"Lakhany","id":"37694759600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629953","dbTime":"49 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic cores","Benchmark testing","Hardware","Pricing","Software","Resource management","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","financial data processing","Monte Carlo methods","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA acceleration","Monte-Carlo based credit derivative pricing","client portfolios","collateralized debt obligations pricing","one-factor Gaussian copula model"]}],"abstract":"In recent years the financial world has seen an increasing demand for faster risk simulations, driven by growth in client portfolios.

The QMC approach is popular because for many types of derivatives it yields an estimate of the price, to a given accuracy, faster than other competitive approaches, like Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The calculation of the large number of underlying asset pathways consumes a significant portion of the overall run-time and energy of modern QMC derivative pricing simulations. Therefore, we present an FPGA-based accelerator for the calculation of asset pathways suitable for use in the QMC pricing of several types of derivative securities.

The solution of a system of linear equations forms the basis of many problems in engineering and science, but its calculation is highly time consuming. The minimum residual algorithm (MINRES) is one method to solve this problem, and is highly effective provided the matrix exhibits certain characteristics. This paper examines an IEEE 754 single precision floating point implementation of the MINRES algorithm on an FPGA. It demonstrates that through parallelisation and heavy pipelining of all floating point components it is possible to achieve a sustained performance of up to 53 GFLOPS on the Virtex5-330T. This compares favourably to other hardware implementations of floating point matrix inversion algorithms, and corresponds to an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude compared to a software implementation.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629967","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629967.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based implementation of the MINRES algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629967/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based implementation of the MINRES algorithm","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629967/","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10221734","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based implementation of the MINRES algorithm","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"W1B_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048324S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629968,"authors":[{"name":"Markos Papadonikolakis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Markos","lastName":"Papadonikolakis","id":"37681211700"},{"name":"Christos-Savvas Bouganis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos-Savvas","lastName":"Bouganis","id":"37299183200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629968","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"abstract":"Support vector machines (SVMs) are an effective, adaptable and widely used method for supervised classification.

We use the message passing communication paradigm with all necessary communication operations performed by dedicated control hardware, independently of the interconnect.

Fast and compact hardware implementations are required. This paper introduces the bilinear interpolation method to produce fast and compact numerical function generators (NFGs) for two-variable functions. This paper also introduces a design method for symmetric two-variable functions. This method can reduce the memory size needed for symmetric functions by nearly half with small speed penalty. Experimental results show that the bilinear interpolation method can significantly reduce the memory size needed for two-variable functions, and the speed of NFGs based on the bilinear method is comparable to that of NFGs based on tangent plane approximation. For a complicated function, our NFG is faster and more compact than a circuit designed using a one-variable NFG.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629984","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629984.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical function generators using bilinear interpolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629984/","displayDocTitle":"Numerical function generators using bilinear interpolation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250308","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629984/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical function generators using bilinear interpolation","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"P1_10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05447S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4629985,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Perez-Andrade","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Optics and Electronics INAOE, National Institute for Astrophysics Optics and Electronics, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Perez-Andrade","id":"38276487900"},{"name":"Rene Cumplido","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Optics and Electronics INAOE, National Institute for Astrophysics Optics and Electronics, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"Cumplido","id":"37393936800"},{"name":"Claudia Feregrino-Uribe","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Optics and Electronics INAOE, National Institute for Astrophysics Optics and Electronics, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Feregrino-Uribe","id":"38274862700"},{"name":"Fernando Martin Del Campo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Optics and Electronics INAOE, National Institute for Astrophysics Optics and Electronics, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Fernando Martin","lastName":"Del Campo","id":"38272798000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629985","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Computer architecture","Radar","Sorting","Arrays","Noise","Radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","radar receivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["versatile hardware architecture","CFAR detector","linear insertion sorter","first in first out schema","software defined radar","field programmable gate array"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a versatile hardware architecture that implements six variant of the CFAR detector based on linear and non-linear operations.

The common resource contention forces to stall temporarily the execution of one or more of the bus masters, slowing down the execution. Moreover, the width of the bus is usually relatively small, forcing the bus master to perform several bus cycles in order to transfer a data block from the main memory to a peripheral (or to a processing element), and the other way around. The combination of these factors leads to problems and inefficiencies which designers need to solve. In this paper we present a dedicated hardware used to allow an external accelerator to access the system memory independently from the main microprocessor. The proposed device is able to exchange data with the memory in a DMA-like fashion, to generate properly memory addresses in order to access it in an efficient way. Results show that using such a solution it is possible to reach a considerable speed-up in the execution of a given algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629990","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629990.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dedicated DMA logic addressing a time multiplexed memory to reduce the effects of the system bus bottleneck","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629990/","displayDocTitle":"A dedicated DMA logic addressing a time multiplexed memory to reduce the effects of the system bus bottleneck","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10250313","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629990/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dedicated DMA logic addressing a time multiplexed memory to reduce the effects of the system bus bottleneck","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"P2_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047456S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4629992,"authors":[{"name":"Diana Gohringer","affiliation":["FGAN-FOM, Germany"],"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"Gohringer","id":"37393007400"},{"name":"Michael Hubner","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hubner","id":"37300247900"},{"name":"Thomas Perschke","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Perschke","id":"37300359600"},{"name":"Jurgen Becker","affiliation":["FGAN-FOM, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Becker","id":"37270020100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629992","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Parallel processing","Switches","Image processing","Computer architecture","Software","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","reconfigurable architectures","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RAMPSoC approach","multiprocessor hardware architectures","image data processing","object tracking","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","hardware adaptation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MPSoC","Reconfigurable Hardware","Image Processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629992","abstract":"Multiprocessor hardware architectures enable to distribute tasks of an application to several microprocessors, in order to exploit parallelism for accelerating the performance of computation.

However, the AccelDSP approach shows an advantage of a shorter design time and early trade-off analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE802.16-2004 OFDM functions implementation on FPGAS with design exploration","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629998","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629998.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"IEEE802.16-2004 OFDM functions implementation on FPGAS with design exploration","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629998/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10221745","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE802.16-2004 OFDM functions implementation on FPGAS with design exploration","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"P2_10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051139S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4629999,"authors":[{"name":"Seamas McGettrick","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Seamas","lastName":"McGettrick","id":"37695823800"},{"name":"Dermot Geraghty","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Dermot","lastName":"Geraghty","id":"37603704200"},{"name":"Ciaran McElroy","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Ciaran","lastName":"McElroy","id":"37686883200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1960-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1961-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"4629999","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":448},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Field programmable gate arrays","Mathematical model","Equations","Internet","Adders","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","field programmable gate arrays","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA architecture","PageRank eigenvector problem","matrix calculation","sparse matrix","vector multiplication","general-purpose processors","Virtex 5 FPGA","real Internet link matrices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4629999","abstract":"Googlepsilas PageRank (PR) eigenvector problem is the worldpsilas largest matrix calculation. The algorithm is dominated by Sparse Matrix by Vector Multiplication (SMVM) where the matrix is very sparse, unsymmetrical and unstructured. The computation presents a serious challenge to general-purpose processors (GPP) and the result is a very lengthy computation time. In this paper, we present an architecture for solving the PR eigenvalue problem on the Virtex 5 FPGA. The architecture is optimised to take advantage of the unique features of the PR algorithm and FPGA technology. Performance benchmarks are presented for a selection of real Internet link matrices. Finally these results are compared with equivalent GPP implementations of the PR algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2008.4629999","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4625340/4629890/04629999.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2008.4629999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA architecture for the Pagerank eigenvector problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4629999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA architecture for the Pagerank eigenvector problem","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4629999/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sep. 2008","accessionNumber":"10221746","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA architecture for the Pagerank eigenvector problem","confLoc":"Heidelberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"P2_11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097317S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4625340","isNumber":"4629890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4625340","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4629890","articleId":"4629999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
