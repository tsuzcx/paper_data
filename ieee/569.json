This information is spatially and temporally labeled into knowledge which will be encoded as input to ANN models that convert it into intelligence. At the top tier of our system, the trained neural models make intelligent decisions and report fire in its early stages based on gathered field knowledge. In our experimentation, we extended the sensing capability of the MicaZ sensor motes by attaching external smoke detectors of our own design. The results are very promising as the SFFEDSS unit is able to not only detect fire but also accurately report the direction of fire progress which is deduced from the wind direction.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2010.5690033","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1904","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2010 IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2010.5690033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689839","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2010 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5678851/5689839/05690033.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A smart forest-fire early detection sensory system: Another approach of utilizing wireless sensor and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5690033/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A smart forest-fire early detection sensory system: Another approach of utilizing wireless sensor and neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5690033/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11831297","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A smart forest-fire early detection sensory system: Another approach of utilizing wireless sensor and neural networks","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4201902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054801S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5678851","isNumber":"5689839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5678851","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5689839","articleId":"5690033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5690053,"authors":[{"name":"Hideo Furuhashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Aichi Institute of Technology, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Furuhashi","id":"37371485200"},{"name":"Yuta Kuzuya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Aichi Institute of Technology, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuta","lastName":"Kuzuya","id":"37991618300"},{"name":"Yoshiyuki Uchida","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Aichi Institute of Technology, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiyuki","lastName":"Uchida","id":"37345401600"},{"name":"Masatoshi Shimizu","affiliation":["Kansai Electric Power Company, Inc., Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Shimizu","id":"37656334000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8169-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8170-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8168-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"5690053","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5690053","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Arrays","Cameras","Pixel","Sensor systems","Three dimensional displays","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image resolution","image sensors","sensor arrays","solid modelling","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three dimensional imaging sensor system","ultrasonic array sensor data","camera","object shape resolution","3D position","3D image resolution"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a three-dimensional (3D) imaging sensor system that uses an ultrasonic array sensor and a camera.

The sensor network consists of a set of simple gates, which are superimposed over the actual design of any IC. The sensing network and the actual IC design are completely disjoint in order to enable their simultaneous operation. Since the delay of gates is proportional to their temperature, we can obtain temperature of the network gates, by measuring the delay of the gates in the self-sensing network. Once we measured the delay of the circuit, we use CMOS temperature-delay relation and linear programming formulation to calculate the temperature at any point on the chip. High resolution (spatial and temporal) temperature monitoring allows several run-time optimizations. Protecting shared processors from permanent localized damage through rapid creation of hot spots and efficient accounting of the available energy supply are among two main applications of our IC sensor network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5690094/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5690094/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11831328","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A gate level sensor network for integrated circuits temperature monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A gate level sensor network for integrated circuits temperature monitoring","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1451909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048804S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5678851","isNumber":"5689839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5678851","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5689839","articleId":"5690094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5690096,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information and Control Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405827800"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Lu","affiliation":["College of Information and Control Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Lu","id":"38008269200"},{"name":"Yong Yuan","affiliation":["College of Information and Control Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"38003449400"},{"name":"Wenkai Yu","affiliation":["College of Information and Control Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenkai","lastName":"Yu","id":"38008045800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7618-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7617-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1283"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1291"}],"articleNumber":"5690096","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5690096","abstract":"The problem of ground nephogram classification using textural feature extraction and neural networks is considered in this paper.

Low light level imaging is based on the Active Reset (AR) technique combined with the Active Column Sensor (ACS) readout technique for low noise operation. WDR for high light level detection is achieved by utilizing multiple resets via real-time feedback where each pixel in the field of view is independent and can automatically set an exposure time according to its illumination. Due to the commonalities in the low and high light level readout techniques, and the fact that they occur in staggered instances of time, we propose the use of a single column level partitioned pixel amplifier which can be configured in various modes of operation to satisfy the conditions for the suggested techniques. We also propose a Conditional Active Reset (CAR) scheme in which an AR is employed for every reset in the multiple-reset WDR algorithm, thereby reducing the overall noise involved in the technique. The advantages of the proposed column level partitioned pixel amplifier are simplicity in the analog readout path, reduced chip size and less power consumption. The Variable Topology Amplifier was designed and simulated in a mixed signal 0.18 um CMOS technology.

A dimpled diaphragm was constructed using low-pressure chemical-vapor deposited (LPCVD) low-stress silicon nitride. A sacrificial double-layer, consisting of amorphous silicon and silicon oxide, was used to form a shallow cavity underneath the diaphragm.

The thin gate oxide as the sensing interface significantly enhances the detection limit, which is comparable to or better than most nanowire-based ISFETs.

Controllable ambipolarity is a desirable property that enables the on-line configurability of n-type and p-type device polarity. In this paper, we introduce a new design methodology for logic gates based on controllable ambipolar devices, with an emphasis on carbon nanotubes as the candidate technology. Our technique results in ambipolar gates with a higher expressive power than conventional complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) libraries. We propose a library of static ambipolar carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNTFET) gates based on generalized NOR-NAND-AOI-OAI primitives, which efficiently implements XOR-based functions. Technology mapping of several multi-level logic benchmarks that extensively use the XOR function, including multipliers, adders, and linear circuits, with ambipolar CNTFET logic gates indicates that on average, it is possible to reduce the number of logic levels by 42%, the delay by 26%, and the power consumption by 32%, resulting in a energy-delay-product (EDP) reduction of 59 % over the same circuits mapped with unipolar CNTFET logic gates. Based on the projections in [1], where it is stated that defectfree CNTFETs will provide a 5x performance improvement over metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors, the ambipolar library provides a performance improvement of 7x, a 57% reduction in power consumption, and a 20x improvement in EDP over the CMOS library.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2085250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5689108/05690255.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2085250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689108","startPage":"242","endPage":"255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Gate Library for Ambipolar CNTFET Logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5690255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Gate Library for Ambipolar CNTFET Logic","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5690255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11760195","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5690255/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Gate Library for Ambipolar CNTFET Logic","sourcePdf":"tcad-benjamaa-2085250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110592S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5689108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5689108","articleId":"5690255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5690292,"authors":[{"name":"Weimei Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Weimei Li","id":"38006859700"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Jing Li","id":"38008062200"},{"name":"Jiaquan Zhang","affiliation":["College of Physics, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Jiaquan Zhang","id":"38010287700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7618-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7617-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1283"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1291"}],"articleNumber":"5690292","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Artificial neural networks","Image edge detection","Optical fiber theory","Charge coupled devices","Wavelet analysis","Training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","fibrous fracture surface","automatic focusing","automatic exposure","image fusion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5690292","abstract":"A method is proposed for image capture of fibrous fracture surface based on BP-neural network and wavelet, which solved the problem of uneven luminosity image's obtaining.

The cell squeezing is realized by fabricating smaller microfluidic channel than cell size. The electrical impedances are measured through 3D-IDE.

In particular, solar energy harvesting has been commonly used to overcome this barrier. However, it should be noted that WSNs operating on solar power suffer form energy shortage during nighttimes. Therefore, to solve this problem, we exploit the use of TV broadcasts airwaves as energy sources to power wireless sensor nodes. We measured the output of a rectenna continuously for 7 days; from the results of this measurement, we showed that Radio Frequency (RF) energy can always be harvested. We developed an RF energy harvesting WSN prototype to show the effectiveness of RF energy harvesting for the usage of a WSN. We also proposed a duty cycle determination method for our system, and verified the validity of this method by implementing our system. This RF energy harvesting method is effective in a long period measurement application that do not require high power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2010.5690588","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2010 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2010 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5678851/5689839/05690588.pdf","startPage":"1282","endPage":"1287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2010.5690588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prototype implementation of ambient RF energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5690588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Prototype implementation of ambient RF energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5690588/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11831574","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5690588/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prototype implementation of ambient RF energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2841658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059464S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5678851","isNumber":"5689839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5678851","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5689839","articleId":"5690588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5690661,"authors":[{"name":"Milin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Milin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406626100"},{"name":"Panpan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Panpan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37999118700"},{"name":"Amine Bermak","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Amine","lastName":"Bermak","id":"37275353200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8169-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8170-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8168-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"5690661","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Image coding","Three dimensional displays","CMOS image sensors","Photodiodes","Image storage","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","data compression","image coding","photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three dimensional compressive acquisition CMOS image sensor","3D compressive acquisition CMOS image sensor","on-line parallel compression algorithm","3D sensor architecture","image acquisition hierarchy","image compression hierarchy layer","image storage hierarchy layer","light intensity","photodiode","reference voltage value","time-slot signal","on-line compression processing","digital brightest pixel value","raw pixel value","reference brightest pixel value","fill factor"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, architecture of a three dimensional (3D) compressive acquisition CMOS image sensor integrated with on-line parallel compression algorithm is proposed. The proposed 3D sensor architecture consists of three hierarchy layers: an image acquisition hierarchy, an image compression hierarchy layer, and an image storage hierarchy layer. The image acquisition hierarchy converts light intensity into current using photodiode. In the second layer, the analog current values are converted into time-slot by comparing with a reference voltage value. The time-slot signal is used in the on-line compression processing. The digital brightest pixel value is used as a reference value, while the differential value between the reference and the raw pixel value is calculated and quantized. The quantized results (typically 2-bit) as well as the reference brightest pixel value are stored in the third hierarchy layer. Compared with standard two dimensional (2D) compressive acquisition CMOS image sensor design, about 70% silicon area is reduced by the 3D integration of different layers.

The proposed approach is to employ a 3D imaging sensor-the SwissRanger SR4000-for both pose estimation and perception. The SR4000 produces both intensity and range images of its surrounding. The key idea for pose estimation is to perform feature extraction and matching between successive intensity images and use the 3D locations of the matched features to determine the PRD's pose. The method for obstacle detection/recognition is to segment the sensor's range data into planar surfaces, group the surfaces into structures, and identify the structures based on their geometric constituents. The proposed segmentation method is based on graph theory and it uses global features to measure inter-segment dissimilarity. The proposed methods' efficacies have been validated by experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Navigating a Portable Robotic Device by a 3D imaging sensor","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2010 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2010.5690750","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2010 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5678851/5689839/05690750.pdf","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2010.5690750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5690750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5690750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Navigating a Portable Robotic Device by a 3D imaging sensor","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5690750/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11831658","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Navigating a Portable Robotic Device by a 3D imaging sensor","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2241324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058382S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5678851","isNumber":"5689839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5678851","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5689839","articleId":"5690750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5690797,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhi Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Hongzhi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596247700"},{"name":"Kemiao Jia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Kemiao","lastName":"Jia","id":"37410832400"},{"name":"Xuesong Liu","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292949600"},{"name":"Guizhen Yan","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guizhen","lastName":"Yan","id":"37288367200"},{"name":"Yu-Wen Hsu","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Wen","lastName":"Hsu","id":"38000260900"},{"name":"Huikai Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Huikai","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274636600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8169-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8170-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8168-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"5690797","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"abstract":"This paper describes a novel differential difference amplifier (DDA) with boosted gain, low temperature dependence, low noise and low power consumption for applications in monolithic CMOS-MEMS gyroscopes.

The link includes a Class-E power amplifier, an inductive link, a matching network, and a rectifier. The coils of the inductive link are designed and optimized for a distance of 10mm (scalp thickness). The power amplifier is designed in order to allow closed loop power control by controlling the supply voltage. A new packaging topology is proposed in order to position the implant in the skull, without occupying much area, but still obtaining short distance between the remote powering coils. The package is fabricated using biocompatible materials such as PDMS and Parylene-C, and it includes the secondary coil, the matching network, and the rectifier. The power efficiency of the link is characterized for a wide range of load power (1-20mW) and found to be 8.1% for nominal load of 10mW. The matching network improves the power efficiency on the whole range, compared to the link without the matching network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5690844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11831710","htmlLink":"/document/5690844/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Inductive power link for a wireless cortical implant with biocompatible packaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inductive power link for a wireless cortical implant with biocompatible packaging","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0211689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049718S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5678851","isNumber":"5689839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5678851","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5689839","articleId":"5690844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5690877,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Feng","affiliation":["Department of Forensic Science & Technology, China Criminal Police University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Xu Feng","id":"38006122800"},{"name":"Shan Daguo","affiliation":["Department of Forensic Science & Technology, China Criminal Police University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Shan Daguo","id":"37992938500"},{"name":"Yang Hongchen","affiliation":["Department of Forensic Science & Technology, China Criminal Police University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Yang Hongchen","id":"37992984600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7618-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7617-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1283"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1291"}],"articleNumber":"5690877","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Image segmentation","Brain modeling","Noise","Fires"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN)","image segmentation","edge detection","gray image"]}],"abstract":"Based on the shortcomings of the traditional edge detection algorithm easily lead to the brink of fracture and discontinuous, a new improved Pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) is proposed to image segmentation and edge detection.

Meanwhile, Cooperative relay is well known as a powerful technology to combat signal fading in a wireless medium. In this paper, we discuss a new relay selection algorithm for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks by utilizing cooperative relay to improve spectrum diversity and transmission rate. We define a cooperation-table which considers several aspects including channel gain, channel available probability and spectrum heterogeneity of secondary nodes. Based on this cooperation-table, a new distributed relay selection algorithm is proposed that choose a relay node to maximize the transmission rate of the source node. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the relay selection algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691264","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5668576/5691186/05691264.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5691186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691264","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Network and Service Management","startPage":"439","endPage":"442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed relay selection algorithm for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5691264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A distributed relay selection algorithm for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5691264/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5691264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11760401","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed relay selection algorithm for cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"rp08374160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048267S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5668576","isNumber":"5691186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5668576","xplore-issue":"5691186","articleId":"5691264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5691291,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Our approach leverages light-weight signal processing and statistical learning algorithms to achieve online predictions of dynamic application resource requirements. We have implemented the PRESS system on Xen and tested it using RUBiS and an application load trace from Google. Our experiments show that we can achieve good resource prediction accuracy with less than 5% over-estimation error and near zero under-estimation error, and elastic resource scaling can both significantly reduce resource waste and SLO violations.","doi":"10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691343","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5668576/5691186/05691343.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5691186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691343","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Network and Service Management","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRESS: PRedictive Elastic ReSource Scaling for cloud systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5691343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"PRESS: PRedictive Elastic ReSource Scaling for cloud systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5691343/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5691343/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11760445","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRESS: PRedictive Elastic ReSource Scaling for cloud systems","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"rp00374067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12213S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5668576","isNumber":"5691186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5668576","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"5691186","articleId":"5691343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5691488,"authors":[{"name":"Liu-bing Jiang","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, GUET, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Liu-bing","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085970814"},{"name":"Li Che","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, GUET, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Che","id":"37085971300"},{"name":"Lin-feng Chai","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, GUET, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Lin-feng","lastName":"Chai","id":"37085971905"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7618-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7617-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1283"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1291"}],"articleNumber":"5691488","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays","Bandwidth","Performance evaluation","Hardware","Sampling methods","Receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB-TWSR","pseudo-random","equivalent","sequential equivalent sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5691488","abstract":"The main task of UWB-TWSR receiving system is to have echo signal for A/D convert and to the supply of back-end platform for processing, the TWSR signal bandwidth is usually from DC to GHz, moreover,it has periodicity, so equivalent time sampling can be used on the TWSR the signal digital-analog conversion.

Simulation results indicate that the maximum SNR and ENOB of this pipeline ADC reach the value of 82dB and 14 bits respectively under the case of the input signal frequency at 9.72MHz and the sampling clock at 100MHz after calibration.","doi":"10.1109/ICISE.2010.5691575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISE.2010.5691575","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5680733/5688492/05691575.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of a digitally assisted 14-bit 100MSample/s pipelined ADC using open-loop residue amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of a digitally assisted 14-bit 100MSample/s pipelined ADC using open-loop residue amplification","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5691575/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5691575/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of a digitally assisted 14-bit 100MSample/s pipelined ADC using open-loop residue amplification","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"Q468893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047023S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5680733","isNumber":"5688492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5680733","xplore-issue":"5688492","articleId":"5691575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5691577,"authors":[{"name":"Duanmu Chunjiang","affiliation":["College of Mathematics Physics and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Normal University, ZJNU, Jinhua, China"],"lastName":"Duanmu Chunjiang","id":"37990998700"},{"name":"Huang Feng","affiliation":["College of Mathematics Physics and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Normal University, ZJNU, Jinhua, China"],"lastName":"Huang Feng","id":"38000336700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7618-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7617-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1283"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1291"}],"articleNumber":"5691577","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Synchronization","OFDM","Training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed MIMO-OFDM","timing synchronization","CAZAC"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a time and frequency synchronizaton algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems.

Then, in accordance with three stages of hand gesture recognition, we suggest a new method for static hand gesture recognition. Firstly, we apply the improved RCE neural network to hand image segmentation. Secondly, we use Freeman chain code to extract the distance from hand edge to the palm-center as feature vectors. Finally, we use those feature vectors as the input of RBF neural network and train the RBF neural network. Experiment results show this method is efficient and feasible.

An fMRI image registration approach was proposed based on normalized maximum mutual information, Simplex and genetic algorithm. In the algorithm, we utilize normalized maximum mutual information as the similarity measurement; genetic algorithm and Nelder-Mead's simplex method are respectively responsible for the global approximate optimization and local accurate search of image translation and rotation parameters. According to the registration analysis of the time series fMRI images, this algorithm is proved to be a precise, fast approach compared with the traditional direct search method and genetic algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a novel block-based intermediate code as an alternative to classic convolutional intermediate codes. Because it is block-based, our intermediate code facilitates practical implementations with reduced memory and processing requirements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is simpler to analyze and optimize the iterative decoding process when our block-based intermediate code is employed, instead of a convolutional intermediate code. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed block-based intermediate code facilitates significantly reduced error ratios in practical schemes when employing short transmission frames and a limited decoding complexity.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5730612/05692127.pdf","startPage":"762","endPage":"770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extrinsic Information Transfer Analysis and Design of Block-Based Intermediate Codes","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2106809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2106809","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Extrinsic Information Transfer Analysis and Design of Block-Based Intermediate Codes","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11862668","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5692127/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extrinsic Information Transfer Analysis and Design of Block-Based Intermediate Codes","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2106809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094458S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5730612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5730612","articleId":"5692127","onlineDate":"17 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5692128,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["School of ECS, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5730612/5692128/5692128-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rong Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in communications engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2003 and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in radio frequency communications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","He was previously a System Engineer with the Mobile Communications Division, China Telecom.

The performance of this approach is profiled via the control of a 14th-order resonant structure with 12 sample prediction horizon at 200-\u03bcs sampling rate. The results indicate that no more than 30 \u03bcs are required to compute the control action.

For signal acquisition, incoherent sub-sampling is employed to increase the effective sampling rate of a digitizer and to simplify its signal acquisition architecture by removing the need for timing synchronization circuits. As a substitute for these circuits, algorithms for signal clock recovery (CR) and waveform reconstruction from the acquired data are developed in this research. The algorithms utilize peak identification of the sampled signal spectrum and the sparsity of the reconstructed waveform in the frequency domain as decision making criteria for accurate signal reconstruction. The jitter value of such a reconstructed waveform is quantified with the use of a wavelet based denoising method to generate a self-reference signal against which zero-crossing times are compared to generate jitter statistics. In addition, the data dependent jitter components can be differentiated from the original jitter by analyzing zero-crossing discrepancies of the self-reference signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5692212/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11761764","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Jitter Characterization of Pseudo-random Bit Sequences Using Incoherent Sub-sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jitter Characterization of Pseudo-random Bit Sequences Using Incoherent Sub-sampling","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4248a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051306S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689827","isNumber":"5692210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689827","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5692210","articleId":"5692212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5692230,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Micro fluidic biochips are often used for safety-critical applications, clinical diagnosis, and for genome analysis. Thus, devising effective and faster testing methodologies to warrant correct operations of these devices after manufacture and during bioassay operations, is very much needed. In this paper, we propose a technique to obtain the route plan of a test droplet for the purpose of structural testing of biochips. The technique is applicable to fully reconfigurable arrays and application specific biochips. We propose an improved eulerization technique to implement the test plan based on a graph model of the chip. The optimal eulerization can be abstracted in terms of the classical Chinese postman problem. The Euler tour can then be identified using a cycle decomposition method, which is easy to implement. This can also be used in phase-based test planning leading to significant savings in testing time. The method provides a unified approach towards unidirectional structural testing and can be easily adapted to design an improved droplet routing procedure for bidirectional functional testing of digital micro fluidic biochips.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing of Digital Microfluidic Biochips Using Improved Eulerization Techniques and the Chinese Postman Problem","publicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2010.28","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689827/5692210/05692232.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2010.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Testing of Digital Microfluidic Biochips Using Improved Eulerization Techniques and the Chinese Postman Problem","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692232/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11761768","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing of Digital Microfluidic Biochips Using Improved Eulerization Techniques and the Chinese Postman Problem","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4248a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103047S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689827","isNumber":"5692210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689827","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5692210","articleId":"5692232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5692245,"authors":[{"name":"Yizi Xing","affiliation":["Automotive Business Unit, NXP Semiconductors, Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yizi","lastName":"Xing","id":"37361644200"},{"name":"Liquan Fang","affiliation":["Automotive Business Unit, NXP Semiconductors, Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Liquan","lastName":"Fang","id":"37956697600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8841-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"5692245","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Voltage measurement","Semiconductor device measurement","Radiation detectors","Temperature measurement","Generators","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","automatic test equipment","automotive electronics","design for testability","IEEE standards","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive SoC","design for test","digitally-assisted analog IP","on-chip measurement","IEEE 1500 standard","analog test","parametric DC","delay measurements","ATE","outlier-screening methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design-for-Test","On-chip measurement","Digitally-assisted analog IP","Automotive SoC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692245","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2010.41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2010.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692210","publicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689827/5692210/05692245.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design-for-Test of Digitally-Assisted Analog IPs for Automotive SoCs","abstract":"This paper presents a Design-for-Test approach for digitally-assisted analog IPs in automotive applications.

In this paper, a novel RF test methodology is developed that: (a) allows RF devices to be tested for amplitude and phase distortion in test time comparable to what can be achieved using supervised learning techniques while retaining the accuracy of direct specification measurement, (b) allows multiple RF specifications to be determined concurrently from a single data acquisition and (c) does not require any training for accurate test specification computation. The proposed method based on amplitude modulated RF stimulus driven RF distortion extraction is shown to give excellent results across common RF performance metrics (RMS error <;1.4%) while providing ~10\u00d7 improvements in test time compared to previous methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2010.84","publicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689827/5692210/05692259.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"282","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2010.84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid Radio Frequency Amplitude and Phase Distortion Measurement Using Amplitude Modulated Stimulus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Rapid Radio Frequency Amplitude and Phase Distortion Measurement Using Amplitude Modulated Stimulus","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5692259/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11761804","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692259/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid Radio Frequency Amplitude and Phase Distortion Measurement Using Amplitude Modulated Stimulus","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4248a277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050669S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689827","isNumber":"5692210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689827","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5692210","articleId":"5692259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5692260,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The test stimulus is obtained from a filtered digital pattern and the RF response is down-converted using an envelope detector. The resulting signal is mapped to a digital signature, such that the Hamming Distance between the observed and the golden signature represents the degree by which the circuit specifications (Gain, IIP3, EVM, etc) differ from the ideal. A hardware driven algorithm is used to minimize this Hamming Distance to concurrently optimize (tune) multiple RF specifications. As opposed to prior research, the method does not require the use of an on-chip digital signal processor and uses minimal on-chip hardware. Results obtained on a 2.4 GHz transmitter subsystem show significant impact of tuning on device specifications.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2010.55","publicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689827/5692210/05692260.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2010.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digitally Assisted Concurrent Built-In Tuning of RF Systems Using Hamming Distance Proportional Signatures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692260/","displayDocTitle":"Digitally Assisted Concurrent Built-In Tuning of RF Systems Using Hamming Distance Proportional Signatures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11761817","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692260/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digitally Assisted Concurrent Built-In Tuning of RF Systems Using Hamming Distance Proportional Signatures","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4248a283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065634S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689827","isNumber":"5692210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689827","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5692210","articleId":"5692260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5692276,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Wei Chou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-Wei","lastName":"Chou","id":"37404984500"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Fu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279861800"},{"name":"Ji-Jan Chen","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratory (ICL), Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ji-Jan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37351180500"},{"name":"Ding-Ming Kwai","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratory (ICL), Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ding-Ming","lastName":"Kwai","id":"37294410600"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Chou","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratory (ICL), Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Chou","id":"37265084400"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratory (ICL), Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276423200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8841-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"5692276","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":795},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Testing","Registers","Switches","Strontium","Through-silicon vias"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","integrated circuit testing","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test integration methodology","3D integrated circuits","three dimensional integration technology","through silicon via","prebond test","known good stack","postbond test","IEEE 1149.1 standard","board level testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Test","test integration","3D IC","1149.1","test interface"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692276","abstract":"The three-dimensional (3D) integration technology using through silicon via (TSV) provides many benefits over the 2D integration technology.

One of the challenges is the testing of 3D ICs. This paper proposes test integration interfaces for controlling the design-for-test circuits in the dies of a 3D IC. The test integration interfaces can support the pre-bond, known-good stack, and post-bond tests. The minimum number of required test pads of the proposed test interface for pre-bond test using is only four. Furthermore, the test interface is compatible with the IEEE 1149.1 standard for the board-level testing.

In this process, we perturb the strength of the two TSV drivers, and then measure their effects in terms of the change of the oscillation ring's period. By some following analysis, the propagation delay of each TSV can be revealed.

March test of O(n) is the most widely used approach for its high fault coverage and systematic way of extending the test sequences. Size of the March test is guided by the number of fault models. Most of the March test generation algorithms reported so far, takes long time especially in case of number of operations exceeding seven. In this work, we propose a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based March test generator which gives tests of high fault coverage, at a much lesser time compared to the existing approaches. Since the time to generate long March tests increases rapidly, in this work, we show that combining March tests of shorter lengths can replace the long March sequences without compromising fault coverage. Another bottleneck in memory testing is the power dissipation. The fitness function of the proposed PSO can be tuned to obtain March tests with high fault coverage, low power consumption, reduced peak power or a combination of any of these three. The experiments carried out confirm the effectiveness of our approach as it produces better results than those reported in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2010.75","startPage":"401","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2010.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692210","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689827/5692210/05692280.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Scheme for Low Power March Sequence Generation for Memory Testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692280/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Scheme for Low Power March Sequence Generation for Memory Testing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692280/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11761767","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Scheme for Low Power March Sequence Generation for Memory Testing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4248a401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09477S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689827","isNumber":"5692210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689827","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5692210","articleId":"5692280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5692285,"authors":[{"name":"Mottaqiallah Taouil","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Faculty of EE, Mathematics and CS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Mottaqiallah","lastName":"Taouil","id":"37599792100"},{"name":"Said Hamdioui","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Faculty of EE, Mathematics and CS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"Hamdioui","id":"37273368500"},{"name":"Kees Beenakker","affiliation":["DIMES Technology Center, Faculty of EE, Mathematics and CS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Kees","lastName":"Beenakker","id":"37392829700"},{"name":"Erik Jan Marinissen","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Erik Jan","lastName":"Marinissen","id":"37273353200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8841-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"5692285","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":676},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stacking","Three dimensional displays","Semiconductor device modeling","Packaging","Silicon carbide","Solid modeling","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["costing","integrated circuit testing","integrated circuit yield","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test cost analysis","3D die-to-wafer stacking","three dimensional stacked IC","3D-SIC","cost model","cost-effective test flow","prebond tests"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D test flow","3D test cost","Die-to-Wafer stacking","3D manufacturing cost","Through-Silicon-Via"]}],"abstract":"The industry is preparing itself for three-dimensional stacked ICs (3D-SICs), a technology that promises heterogeneous integration with higher performance and lower power dissipation at a smaller footprint. Several 3D stacking approaches are under development. From a yield point of view, Die-to-Wafer (D2W) stacking seems the most favorable approach, due to the ability of Known Good Die stacking. Minimizing the test cost for such a stacking approach is a challenging task. Every manufactured chip has to be tested, and any tiny test saving per 3D-SIC impacts the overall cost, especially in high-volume production. This paper establishes a cost model for D2W SICs and investigates the impact of the test cost for different test flows. It first introduces a framework covering different test flows for 3D D2W ICs. Subsequently, it proposes a test cost model to estimate the impact of the test flow on the overall 3D-SIC cost. Our simulation results show that (a) test flows with pre-bond testing significantly reduce the overall cost, (b) a cheaper test flow does not necessary result in lower overall cost, (c) test flows with intermediate tests (performed during the stacking process) pay off, (d) the most cost-effective test flow consists of pre-bond tests and strongly depends on the stack yield, hence, adapting the test according the stack yield is the best approach to use.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2010.80","publicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 19th IEEE Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689827/5692210/05692285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2010.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692210","startPage":"435","endPage":"441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test Cost Analysis for 3D Die-to-Wafer Stacking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Test Cost Analysis for 3D Die-to-Wafer Stacking","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692285/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11761778","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5692285/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test Cost Analysis for 3D Die-to-Wafer Stacking","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4248a435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105563S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689827","isNumber":"5692210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689827","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5692210","articleId":"5692285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5692288,"authors":[{"name":"Farrokh Ghani Zadegan","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Farrokh Ghani","lastName":"Zadegan","id":"37990825200"},{"name":"Urban Ingelsson","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Urban","lastName":"Ingelsson","id":"37402778900"},{"name":"Gunnar Carlsson","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Gunnar","lastName":"Carlsson","id":"37658129400"},{"name":"Erik Larsson","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Larsson","id":"37085445298"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8841-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"5692288","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Schedules","Hip","Clocks","Registers","System-on-a-chip","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design for testability","sequential circuits","telecommunication standards","test equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test time analysis","IEEE P1687","on-chip embedded logic","IEEE 1149.1","test data transport","test protocol","board test","select instrument bits","scan path"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Test Time Calculation","IEEE P1687 IJTAG","Test Architectures","Test Schedules"]}],"abstract":"The IEEE P1687 (IJTAG) standard proposal aims at providing a standardized interface between on-chip embedded logic (instruments), such as scan-chains and temperature sensors, and the IEEE 1149.1 standard which provides test data transport and test protocol for board test.

A deep analysis of the SDHs algorithm helps found a significant reduction in operations, size and access memory which consequently optimize resources, memory and latency time during the implementation. Furthermore, integer arithmetic operations used by SDHs are directly compatible with the FPGA making faster and efficient the implementation. Final architecture constructs 30 dense texture feature images of 640 \u00d7 480 pixels per second. Also a performance comparison among three different texture analysis architectures highlights a better trade off in performance, latency, logic elements and memory size of our system. The optimization and the resource saving make the proposed architecture an interesting choice to solve the problem of texture analysis in real time, quite used in artificial vision, autonomous navigation and medical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics

The paper presents a demonstration of parallel motion for modular robot configurations through the combination of two types of communications, i.e., Inter-robot and Intra-robot communications. The two types of communications are described and implemented in a real modular robot system.

In both algorithms, the watermark sequence is firstly encoded by non-cyclic Low Density Parity Check Codes (LDPC) and then it is embedded into the block-wised Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients using the Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) algorithm. In the watermark extraction process, the first algorithm extracts the watermark sequence using self-synchronization of sum-product decoding. While the second one firstly extracts some synchronization code embedded previously in the regions centered by feature points of the image, and using them block segmentation starting position can be calculated. The desirable performance of both algorithms about the watermark imperceptibility and robustness against cropping attack with different cropping rate is shown, together with computer complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Watermarking Algorithms with Synchronization Mechanism Using Self-Synchronization Decoding and Feature Points","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference","doi":"10.1109/CERMA.2010.63","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5688735/5692301/05692389.pdf","startPage":"515","endPage":"519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CERMA.2010.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2010-Oct. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Image Watermarking Algorithms with Synchronization Mechanism Using Self-Synchronization Decoding and Feature Points","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692389/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11761545","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Watermarking Algorithms with Synchronization Mechanism Using Self-Synchronization Decoding and Feature Points","confLoc":"Cuernavaca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4204a515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041421S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2010-Oct. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5688735","isNumber":"5692301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5688735","xplore-issue":"5692301","articleId":"5692389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5692390,"authors":[{"name":"Gerardo A.

The task of accurately mapping the reads back to a reference genome is of particular importance because it is used in several other biological applications, e.g., genome re-sequencing, DNA methylation, and ChiP sequencing. On a personal computer (PC), the computationally intensive short-read mapping task currently requires several hours to execute while working on very large sets of reads and genomes. Accelerating this task requires parallel computing. Among the current parallel computing platforms, the graphics processing unit (GPU) provides massively parallel computational prowess that holds the promise of accelerating scientific applications at low cost. In this paper, we propose GPU-RMAP, a massively parallel version of the RMAP short-read mapping tool that is highly optimized for the NVIDIA family of GPUs. We then evaluate GPU-RMAP by mapping millions of synthetic and real reads of varying widths on the mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and human genomes. We also discuss the effects of various input parameters, such as read width, number of reads, and chromosome size, on the performance of GPU-RMAP. We then show that despite using the conventionally \u201cslower\u201d but GPU-compatible binary search algorithm, GPU-RMAP outperforms the sequential RMAP implementation, which uses the \u201cfaster\u201d hashing technique on a PC. Our data-parallel GPU implementation results in impressive speedups of up to 14:5-times for the mapping kernel and up to 9:6-times for the overall program execution time over the sequential RMAP implementation on a traditional PC.","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2010.29","publicationTitle":"2010 13th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689830/5692448/05692471.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2010.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-RMAP: Accelerating Short-Read Mapping on Graphics Processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692471/","displayDocTitle":"GPU-RMAP: Accelerating Short-Read Mapping on Graphics Processors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11762001","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692471/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-RMAP: Accelerating Short-Read Mapping on Graphics Processors","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"4323a168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049235S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689830","isNumber":"5692448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689830","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5692448","articleId":"5692471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5692482,"authors":[{"name":"Mourad Elhadef","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Elhadef","id":"37296313200"},{"name":"Amiya Nayak","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Amiya","lastName":"Nayak","id":"37270550500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9591-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4323-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5692482","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692482","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Neurons","Testing","Nonhomogeneous media","Adaptation model","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","multiprocessing systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized-comparison-based self-diagnosis algorithm","multicomputer system","multilayered neural network","multiprocessor system-level self-diagnosis","generalized comparison model","diagnosis model","faulty node","neural networks-based diagnosis","fault identification problem","off-line learning phase","diagnosable system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault tolerance","System-level diagnosis","Distributed and parallel systems","Generalized comparison model","Neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSE.2010.68","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689830/5692448/05692482.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 13th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","startPage":"245","endPage":"252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2010.68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Generalized-Comparison-Based Self-Diagnosis Algorithm for Multiprocessor and Multicomputer Systems Using a Multilayered Neural Network","abstract":"We consider the system-level self-diagnosis of multiprocessor and multicomputer systems under the generalized comparison model (GCM). In this diagnosis model, a set of tasks is assigned to pairs of nodes and their outcomes are compared by neighboring nodes. The collections of all comparison outcomes, agreements and disagreements among the nodes, are used to identify the set of faulty nodes. We consider only permanent faults in t-diagnosable systems that guarantee that each node can be correctly identified as fault-free or faulty based on a valid collection of comparison results (the syndrome) and assuming that the number of faulty nodes does not exceed a given bound t. Given that comparisons are performed by the nodes themselves, faulty nodes can incorrectly claim that fault-free nodes are faulty or that faulty nodes are fault-free. In this paper, we introduce a novel neural networks-based diagnosis approach to solve this fault identification problem. The new diagnosis approach exploits the off-line learning phase of neural networks to speed up the diagnosis algorithm. We have implemented and evaluated the new diagnosis approach using randomly generated diagnosable systems. The new neural-network-based self-diagnosis approach correctly identified most of the faulty situations forming hence a viable addition or alternative to solve the GCM-based fault identification problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692482/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11761975","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692482/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Generalized-Comparison-Based Self-Diagnosis Algorithm for Multiprocessor and Multicomputer Systems Using a Multilayered Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Generalized-Comparison-Based Self-Diagnosis Algorithm for Multiprocessor and Multicomputer Systems Using a Multilayered Neural Network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"4323a245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070597S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689830","isNumber":"5692448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689830","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5692448","articleId":"5692482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5692486,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-yun Jia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shu-yun","lastName":"Jia","id":"38004797500"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406476300"},{"name":"Jin-tao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin-tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539000300"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai","id":"37270328400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9591-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4323-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5692486","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","MIMO","Complexity theory","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","signal detection","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna selection scheme","MIMO systems","non-constant envelope mapping","diversity gain","signal detection","channel statement information","space-time code orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","STC-OFDM","Alamouti space time block code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna selection","MIMO","non-constant envelope mapping","complexity"]}],"abstract":"To reduce the cost and complexity of receiver without losing much diversity gain, we propose an antenna selection scheme for MIMO systems employing non-constant envelope mapping.

This is mainly due to easy implementation and handling but also to the linear computational complexity, as compared to more elaborated algorithms based on diffusion processes, graph-cut or bilateral filtering. In this paper, we introduce a new two-stage matching cost for the traditional approach: the summed normalized cross-correlation (SNCC). This new cost function performs a normalized cross-correlation in the first stage and aggregates the correlation values in a second stage. We show that this new measure can be implemented efficiently and that it leads to a substantial improvement of the performance of the traditional stereo approach because it is less sensitive to high contrast outliers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689831/5692215/05692569.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2010.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2010.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Stage Correlation Method for Stereoscopic Depth Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Correlation","Cost function","Venus","Runtime","Transforms","Stereo vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computer vision","correlation methods","filtering theory","graph theory","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage correlation method","stereoscopic depth estimation","computer vision","correlation-based versions","linear computational complexity","graph-cut","bilateral filtering","two-stage matching cost","summed normalized cross-correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stereoscopic depth","cost function","reduced fattening"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Stage Correlation Method for Stereoscopic Depth Estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692569/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11760558","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Stage Correlation Method for Stereoscopic Depth Estimation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4271a227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084376S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689831","isNumber":"5692215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689831","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5692215","articleId":"5692569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":5692574,"authors":[{"name":"Hanxi Li","affiliation":["NICTA Canberra Research Laboratory, Australia","Australian National University, Australia"],"firstName":"Hanxi","lastName":"Li","id":"37407168900"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["NICTA Canberra Research Laboratory, Australia","Australian National University, Australia","Beihang University, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599702100"},{"name":"Chunhua Shen","affiliation":["NICTA Canberra Research Laboratory, Australia","Australian National University, Australia"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Shen","id":"37274255300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8816-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4271-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5692574","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":796},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Face detection","Training","Feature extraction","Algorithm design and analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image representation","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust face recognition","accurate face alignment","robust real-time facial recognition system","face detection","eye alignment","computer vision","robust algorithm","efficient algorithm","boosted greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis","face detector","face misalignment","sparse representation-based classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse representation","face recognition","greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis"]}],"abstract":"Due to its potential applications, face recognition has been receiving more and more research attention recently. In this paper, we present a robust real-time facial recognition system. The system comprises three functional components, which are face detection, eye alignment and face recognition, respectively. Within the context of computer vision, there are lots of candidate algorithms to accomplish the above tasks. Having compared the performance of a few state-of-the-art candidates, robust and efficient algorithms are implemented. As for face detection, we have proposed a new approach termed Boosted Greedy Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis (BGSLDA) that produces better performances than most reported face detectors. Since face misalignment significantly deteriorates the recognition accuracy, we advocate a new cascade framework including two different methods for eye detection and face alignment. We have adopted a recent algorithm termed Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) for the face recognition component. Experiments demonstrate that the whole system is highly qualified for efficiency as well as accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2010.54","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689831/5692215/05692574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2010.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692215","startPage":"262","endPage":"269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Face Recognition via Accurate Face Alignment and Sparse Representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Face Recognition via Accurate Face Alignment and Sparse Representation","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692574/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11760538","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5692574/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Face Recognition via Accurate Face Alignment and Sparse Representation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4271a262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083001S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689831","isNumber":"5692215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689831","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5692215","articleId":"5692574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5692603,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Perez Concha","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Sydney University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Oscar Perez","lastName":"Concha","id":"37947279600"},{"name":"Richard Yi Da Xu","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Sydney University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Richard Yi Da","lastName":"Xu","id":"37951542900"},{"name":"Massimo Piccardi","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Sydney University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Piccardi","id":"37283401200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8816-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4271-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5692603","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"abstract":"Compressive Sensing (CS) is an emerging signal processing technique where a sparse signal is reconstructed from a small set of random projections. In the recent literature, CS techniques have demonstrated promising results for signal compression and reconstruction. However, their potential as dimensionality reduction techniques for time series has not been significantly explored to date. To this aim, this work investigates the suitability of compressive-sensed time series in an application of human action recognition. In the paper, results from several experiments are presented: (1) in a first set of experiments, the time series are transformed into the CS domain and fed into a hidden Markov model (HMM) for action recognition, (2) in a second set of experiments, the time series are explicitly reconstructed after CS compression and then used for recognition, (3) in the third set of experiments, the time series are compressed by a hybrid CS-Haar basis prior to input into HMM, (4) in the fourth set, the time series are reconstructed from the hybrid CS-Haar basis and used for recognition. We further compare these approaches with alternative techniques such as sub-sampling and filtering. Results from our experiments show unequivocally that the application of CS does not degrade the recognition accuracy, rather, it often increases it. This proves that CS can provide a desirable form of dimensionality reduction in pattern recognition over time series.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689831/5692215/05692603.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"461","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2010.83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2010.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sensing of Time Series for Human Action Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Hidden Markov models","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture recognition","hidden Markov models","signal reconstruction","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","human action recognition","signal processing","sparse signal","random projection","CS techniques","signal compression","signal reconstruction","dimensionality reduction","compressive sensed time series","hidden Markov model","fourth set","hybrid CS-Haar basis","recognition accuracy","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Oscar Perez Concha","Richard Yi Da Xu","Massimo Piccardi"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing of Time Series for Human Action Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692603/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11760537","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sensing of Time Series for Human Action Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4271a454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060044S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689831","isNumber":"5692215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689831","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5692215","articleId":"5692603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5692617,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu-Ha Song","affiliation":["Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyu-Ha","lastName":"Song","id":"37668928100"},{"name":"Dong-Weon Lee","affiliation":["Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Weon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37880584100"},{"name":"Jin-Woo Han","affiliation":["Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin-Woo","lastName":"Han","id":"37673177500"},{"name":"Byung-Koo Park","affiliation":["Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Koo","lastName":"Park","id":"38006951900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8816-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4271-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5692617","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":453},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Feature extraction","Simulation","Radar countermeasures","Entropy","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic warfare","feature extraction","pulse modulation","radar detection","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse repetition interval modulation recognition","radar signal processing","electronic warfare support system","feature parameter extraction","symbol sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ES","PRI","modulation","recognition","symbolization"]}],"abstract":"Information on the pulse repetition interval (PRI) modulation of a radar signal plays an important role in detecting and identifying each radar signal in an electronic warfare support (ES) system.

Usually, they affect arteries and veins differently. In this regard, the arteriovenous ratio(AVR) is a measure of retinal vessel caliber, widely used in medicine to study the influence of these irregularities in disease evolution. Hence, the development of an automatic tool for AVR computation as well as any other tool for diagnosis support need an objective, reliable and fast artery/vein classifier. This paper proposes a technique to improve the retinal vessel classification in an AVR computation framework. The proposed methodology combines a color clustering strategy and a vessel tracking procedure based on minimal path approaches.

Many automated classifiers have been developed to overcome this problem. These classifiers either have high classification accuracy or high training speed. This paper proposes a classifier that performs well in both areas based on wavelet neural network (WNN), combining the wavelet into neural network for classification of chromosomes in group E (chromosomes 16, 17 and 18). The nonlinear characteristic of the network which is derived from wavelet specification improves the training speed and accuracy of the nonlinear chromosome classification. The network inputs are nine dimensional feature space extracted from the chromosome images and the outputs are three classes. The simulation result on the chromosomes in the Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging shows that the success rate of WNN was 0.93%, that is comparable to the traditional neural network (ANN) with 0.85% success rate. The number of iterations for training to reach 0.04% error rate is only 200 where it is 3500 iterations for ANN. According to the experimental results WNN achieves high accuracy with minimum training time, which makes it suitable for real-time chromosome classification in the laboratory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692628/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11760593","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692628/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Chromosome Classification Based on Wavelet Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chromosome Classification Based on Wavelet Neural Network","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4271a605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040549S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689831","isNumber":"5692215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689831","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5692215","articleId":"5692628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5692660,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38546455100"},{"name":"Ye San","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"San","id":"37271912300"},{"name":"Huishu Shi","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Huishu","lastName":"Shi","id":"38007669900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8094-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5692660","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692660","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Optimization","IEEE Press","Robustness","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","Gaussian distribution","particle swarm optimisation","quantum theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy quantum behaved particle swarm optimization","convergence","fuzzy variable","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm","fuzzy variable","Gaussian distribution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCID.2010.20","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689646/5692648/05692660.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","startPage":"49","endPage":"52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCID.2010.20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","abstract":"Aiming at the drawback of being easily trapped into the local optima and premature convergence in quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm, fuzzy quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm was proposed.

A local search algorithms-Powell algorithm is used when the parallel annealing algorithm is finished at the approximate optimal point to improve the algorithm accuracy, and get the improved global optimal solution. The results show that the hybrid parallel simulated annealing algorithm can deal with multimodal function more effectively.","doi":"10.1109/ISCID.2010.114","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689646/5692208/05692744.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"105","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCID.2010.114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Simulated Annealing Algorithm Based on the Parallel Strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Simulated Annealing Algorithm Based on the Parallel Strategy","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11803617","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5692744/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Simulated Annealing Algorithm Based on the Parallel Strategy","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4198b102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059608S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689646","isNumber":"5692208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689646","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5692208","articleId":"5692744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5692768,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Jian Lin","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Jian","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278415200"},{"name":"Ying-Ming Lin","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Ming","lastName":"Lin","id":"38007663700"},{"name":"Chi-Yung Lee","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Yung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280415100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8094-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5692768","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692768","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Particle swarm optimization","Learning","Optimization","Flowcharts","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","particle swarm optimisation","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear control system","recurrent neural fuzzy network","R-IPSO","reinforcement improved particle swarm optimization","structure learning","parameter learning","fuzzy system","elite-based structure strategy","ESS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural fuzzy network","particle swarm optimization","recurrent network","elite-based structure strategy","reinforcement learning","control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCID.2010.139","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689646/5692208/05692768.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCID.2010.139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear System Control Using a Recurrent Neural Fuzzy Network Based on Reinforcement Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"This paper proposes a recurrent neural fuzzy network with the reinforcement improved particle swarm optimization (R-IPSO) for solving various control problems.

The approach is Bayesian and exploits both spectral and spatial information. Given a spectral vector, the posterior class probability distribution is modeled using multinomial logistic regression (MLR) which, being a discriminative model, allows to learn directly the boundaries between the decision regions and, thus, to successfully deal with high-dimensionality data. To control the machine complexity and, thus, its generalization capacity, the prior on the multinomial logistic vector is assumed to follow a componentwise independent Laplacian density. The vector of weights is computed via the fast sparse multinomial logistic regression (FSMLR), a variation of the sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR), conceived to deal with large data sets beyond the reach of the SMLR. To avoid the high computational complexity involved in estimating the Laplacian regularization parameter, we have also considered the Jeffreys prior, as it does not depend on any hyperparameter. The prior probability distribution on the class-label image is an MLL Markov-Gibbs distribution, which promotes segmentation results with equal neighboring class labels. The -expansion optimization algorithm, a powerful graph-cut-based integer optimization tool, is used to compute the maximum a posteriori segmentation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated by comparing its performance with the state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real hyperspectral image data sets. The reported results give clear evidence of the relevance of using both spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral image segmentation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5770378/05692826.pdf","startPage":"2151","endPage":"2164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2097268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2097268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5770378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Hyperspectral Image Segmentation With Discriminative Class Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Hyperspectral imaging","Laplace equations","Optimization","Kernel","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","computational complexity","geophysical image processing","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","optimisation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian hyperspectral image segmentation","discriminative class learning","multilevel logistic","discriminative classification","probability distribution","high dimensional data","machine complexity","componentwise independent Laplacian density","fast sparse multinomial logistic regression","sparse multinomial logistic regression","large data sets","computational complexity","Laplacian regularization parameter","Jeffreys prior","Markov-Gibbs distribution","\u03b1-expansion optimization algorithm","powerful graph cut based integer optimization tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian methods","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","image segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Hyperspectral Image Segmentation With Discriminative Class Learning","volume":"49","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5692826/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12007018","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Hyperspectral Image Segmentation With Discriminative Class Learning","sourcePdf":"tgrs-borges-2097268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107081S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5770378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5770378","articleId":"5692826","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5692827,"authors":[{"name":"Marian-Daniel Iordache","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5770378/5692827/5692827-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marian-Daniel Iordache received the M.

It aims at estimating the fractional abundances of pure spectral signatures (also called as endmembers) in each mixed pixel collected by an imaging spectrometer. In many situations, the identification of the end-member signatures in the original data set may be challenging due to insufficient spatial resolution, mixtures happening at different scales, and unavailability of completely pure spectral signatures in the scene. However, the unmixing problem can also be approached in semisupervised fashion, i.e., by assuming that the observed image signatures can be expressed in the form of linear combinations of a number of pure spectral signatures known in advance (e.g., spectra collected on the ground by a field spectroradiometer). Unmixing then amounts to finding the optimal subset of signatures in a (potentially very large) spectral library that can best model each mixed pixel in the scene. In practice, this is a combinatorial problem which calls for efficient linear sparse regression (SR) techniques based on sparsity-inducing regularizers, since the number of endmembers participating in a mixed pixel is usually very small compared with the (ever-growing) dimensionality (and availability) of spectral libraries. Linear SR is an area of very active research, with strong links to compressed sensing, basis pursuit (BP), BP denoising, and matching pursuit. In this paper, we study the linear spectral unmixing problem under the light of recent theoretical results published in those referred to areas. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of several available and new linear SR algorithms, with the ultimate goal of analyzing their potential in solving the spectral unmixing problem by resorting to available spectral libraries. Our experimental results, conducted using both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets collected by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer and spectral libraries publicly available from the U.S. Geological Survey, indicate the potential of SR techniques in the task of accurately characterizing the mixed pixels using the library spectra. This opens new perspectives for spectral unmixing, since the abundance estimation process no longer depends on the availability of pure spectral signatures in the input data nor on the capacity of a certain endmember extraction algorithm to identify such pure signatures.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2098413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5770378/05692827.pdf","startPage":"2014","endPage":"2039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5770378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2098413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Unmixing of Hyperspectral Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Unmixing of Hyperspectral Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692827/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12007019","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692827/","volume":"49","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Unmixing of Hyperspectral Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-plaza-2098413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189546S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5770378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"632","xplore-issue":"5770378","articleId":"5692827","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5692830,"authors":[{"name":"Edgar Estupinan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Tarapaca, Arica, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6132629/5692830/5692830-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Edgar Estupinan was born in Bogota, Colombia, in 1972.

This study is an attempt to extend the active lubrication concept to combustion engines and gives a theoretical contribution to this field. One refers to active lubrication when conventional hydrodynamic lubrication is combined with dynamically modified hydrostatic lubrication. In this study, two different schemes for the oil injection system in actively lubricated main engine bearings are presented. The use of active lubrication in journal bearings helps to enhance the hydrodynamic fluid film by increasing the fluid film thickness and consequently reducing viscous friction losses and vibrations. In this study, the hydrostatic lubrication is modified by injecting oil at controllable pressures through orifices circumferentially located around the bearing surface. The main equations that govern the dynamics of the injection for a piezo-actuated oil injector and a mechanical-actuated oil injector are presented. It is shown how the dynamics of the oil injection system is coupled to the dynamics of the bearing fluid film through equations. The global system is numerically solved using as a case study a single-cylinder combustion engine, where the conventional lubrication of the main bearing is modified by applying radial oil injection using piezo-actuated injection. The performance of such a hybrid bearing is compared to an equivalent conventional lubricated bearing in terms of the maximum fluid film pressures, minimum fluid film thicknesses, and reduction of viscous friction losses.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2010.2099663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2010.2099663","endPage":"287","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6132629/05692830.pdf","startPage":"279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controllable Lubrication for Main Engine Bearings Using Mechanical and Piezoelectric Actuators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692830/","displayDocTitle":"Controllable Lubrication for Main Engine Bearings Using Mechanical and Piezoelectric Actuators","volume":"17","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"12477677","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5692830/","publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controllable Lubrication for Main Engine Bearings Using Mechanical and Piezoelectric Actuators","sourcePdf":"tmech-estupinan-2099663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072703S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6132629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6132629","articleId":"5692830","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5692831,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoungchul Kong","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6132629/5692831/5692831-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyoungchul Kong (S'04\u2013M'09) received the B.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering (summa cum laude), the B.S. degree in physics in 2004, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 2006, all from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2009.","In 2011, he joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, Korea.

Specifically, we propose that the algorithm can estimate forces acting on an AFM cantilever being used as a nanomanipulator inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The vision-based force sensor can provide force feedback in real time, a feature absent in many SEMs. A methodology based on cantilever slope detection is used to estimate the forces acting on the cantilever tip. The technique was tested on a scaled model of the nanoscale AFM cantilever and verified using theoretical estimates as well as direct strain measurements. Artificial SEM noise was introduced in the macroscale images to characterize our sensor under varying levels of noise and other SEM effects. Prior knowledge about the cantilever is not required, and the algorithm runs independent of human input. The method is shown to be effective under varying noise levels, and demonstrates improving performance as magnification levels are decreased. Therefore, we conclude that the vision-based force sensing algorithm is best suited for continuous operation of the SEM, fast scanning rates, and large fields-of-view associated with low magnification levels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-based force sensing for nanomanipulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2010.2093535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6011715/05692832.pdf","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2010.2093535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Vision-based force sensing for nanomanipulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5692832/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12216230","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-based force sensing for nanomanipulation","sourcePdf":"tmech-omalley-2093535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082217S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6011715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6011715","articleId":"5692832","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5692836,"authors":[{"name":"Ilan Aharon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Hybrid Energy Sources Laboratory, Ariel University Center of Samaria, Ariel, Israel"],"firstName":"Ilan","lastName":"Aharon","id":"37601430800"},{"name":"Alon Kuperman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Hybrid Energy Sources Laboratory, Ariel University Center of Samaria, Ariel, Israel"],"firstName":"Alon","lastName":"Kuperman","id":"37283773600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"5692836","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":180,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5914},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Mechanical power transmission","Energy storage","Vehicle dynamics","Fuels","Topology","Renewable energy resources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","distributed power generation","fuel cells","maximum power point trackers","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topological overview","battery-powered vehicles","battery-ultracapacitor","power electronic circuitry","fuel-based units","maximum power point tracking strategy","powertrain energy balancing","RERE","FBRE","renewable energy range extender","solar array","fuel-based range extender","fuel consumption","fuel cells","internal combustion engines","DC microgrid","power management circuitry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Batteries","dc microgrids","electric propulsion","electric vehicles","fuel cells","internal combustion engines (ICEs)","power converters","range extenders","renewable energy","ultracapacitors"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a topological overview of hybrid powertrains for battery-powered vehicles reinforced by range extenders. First, tradeoffs of employing high energy versus high power battery are revealed. Then, different topologies of battery-ultracapacitor hybrids are discussed, highlighting pros and cons of each configuration. The superiority of fully active hybrids is indicated, obtained at the expense of increase of power electronic circuitry, control effort, and efficiency. The second part of the paper focuses on two types of range extenders: renewable energy and fuel-based units. The operation strategy is shown to be different for each range extender type. The renewable-energy-based range extender should be operated employing either passive or active maximum power point tracking strategy and hence not be involved in the powertrain energy balancing. It is shown that such a strategy allows the rest of system to perceive the renewable energy range extender (RERE) as a part of the load and act accordingly. Solar array is given as an example of a RERE and the possible connection topologies are discussed. On the other hand, the fuel-based range extender (FBRE) should be operated near the lowest specific fuel consumption point employing maximum efficiency point tracking strategy. Fuel cells and internal combustion engines are specified as examples of FBREs. The complete powertrain is shown to resemble a dc microgrid with source, storage, and load units connected through power management circuitry to a common dc link.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2107037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05692836.pdf","startPage":"868","endPage":"876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2107037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topological Overview of Powertrains for Battery-Powered Vehicles With Range Extenders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692836/","displayDocTitle":"Topological Overview of Powertrains for Battery-Powered Vehicles With Range Extenders","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12004928","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692836/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topological Overview of Powertrains for Battery-Powered Vehicles With Range Extenders","sourcePdf":"tpel-kuperman-2107037-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084997S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5692836","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5692857,"authors":[{"name":"Tung T.

We examined one scenario in which each relay only knows the perfect information of its source-relay channel, whereas the destination knows the exact information of the relay-destination channels and the statistics of the source-relay channels. Based on a combiner that was developed at the destination, we propose an efficient beamforming scheme at the relays and develop its quantized version using Lloyd's algorithm to work with a limited-rate feedback channel. Simulation results show that the nonorthogonal relaying with the proposed beamforming scheme outperforms the orthogonal relaying with power allocation in terms of the ergodic capacity. In terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the nonorthogonal scheme also becomes superior to the orthogonal scheme when the number of quantization regions increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","volume":"60","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11862670","publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692857/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming in Nonorthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming in Nonorthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-pham-2107039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060872S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5730612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5730612","articleId":"5692857","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5692858,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5730612/5692858/5692858-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Chen received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in control science and engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering and material science from Rice University, Houston, TX, in 2009.

The tire-road friction coefficient information is of critical importance for vehicle dynamic control systems and intelligent autonomous vehicle applications. In this paper, the vehicle longitudinal-motion-independent tire-road friction coefficient estimation method consists of three main components: 1) an observer to estimate the internal state of a dynamic LuGre tire model; 2) an adaptive control law with a parameter projection mechanism to track the desired vehicle longitudinal motion in the presence of tire-road friction coefficient uncertainties and actively injected braking excitation signals; and 3) a recursive least square estimator that is independent of the control law, to estimate the tire-road friction coefficient in real time.

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed. The major findings from the game models used for these different access schemes are highlighted. To this end, several of the key open research directions are outlined.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.122310.000119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6026692/05692880.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.122310.000119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game Theoretic Approaches for Multiple Access in Wireless Networks: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692880/","displayDocTitle":"Game Theoretic Approaches for Multiple Access in Wireless Networks: A Survey","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2011","accessionNumber":"12242232","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5692880/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game Theoretic Approaches for Multiple Access in Wireless Networks: A Survey","sourcePdf":"05hossain.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130539S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6026692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"6026692","articleId":"5692880","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5692884,"authors":[{"name":"Taotao Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Taotao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37403876900"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"},{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403296700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5692884","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Measurement","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","space-time block codes","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere decoding","differential space time block coded ultrawideband system","noncoherent multiple symbol detection scheme","ultrawideband impulse radio system","maximum likelihood MSD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","DSTBC","noncoherent","sphere decoding","multiple symbol detection"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a sphere decoding (SD) based noncoherent multiple symbol detection (MSD) scheme is proposed for differential space-time block coded (DSTBC) ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radio systems.

We first consider a point-to-point scenario, i.e., non-cooperative HARQ with AMC. Utilizing a Markov channel model which accounts for the temporal correlation in the successive transmission of incremental redundancy by the HARQ protocol, we derive the system throughput and the packet loss probability based on a rate compatible punctured convolutional code family. Next, we consider a cooperative HARQ (CHARQ) scheme in which a relay node, also equipped with AMC, retransmits redundancy packets when it is able to decode the source information packet correctly. For this scenario, we also derive the throughput and packet loss performance. Finally, we present a cross-layer AMC design approach which takes into account the hybrid ARQ protocol at the link layer. The results illustrate that including AMC in the HARQ protocols leads to a substantial throughput gain. While the performance of the AMC with HARQ protocol is strongly affected by the channel correlation, the CHARQ protocol provides noticeable performance gains over correlated fading channels as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5692898/","accessionNumber":"11874713","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Non-Cooperative and Cooperative Type II Hybrid ARQ Protocols with AMC over Correlated Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Non-Cooperative and Cooperative Type II Hybrid ARQ Protocols with AMC over Correlated Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"0877-tw1103-harsini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069232S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5732655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5732655","articleId":"5692898","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5692899,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Chun Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5732655/5692899/5692899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-Chun Lin (M'08) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2000 and 2007, respectively.

By assuming that the eavesdropper's channel is unknown at the transmitter, we adopt the transmission scheme where artificial noise (AN) is imposed in the null space of the legitimate receiver's channel to disrupt the eavesdropper's reception. It has been shown that, in the ideal case where perfect CDI is available at the transmitter, the achievable secrecy rate can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the transmission power. However, when only quantized CDI is available, the AN that was originally intended to jam the eavesdropper may now leak into the legitimate receiver's channel, causing significant secrecy rate loss. For a given number of feedback bits B and transmission power P, we derive the optimal power allocation among the message-bearing signal and the AN to maximize the secrecy rate under AN leakage. We show that, when B is sufficiently large, one should allocate power evenly among the message-bearing signal and the AN; whereas when B is small, one should be more conservative in allocating power to the AN. Moreover, by showing that the achievable secrecy rate under quantized CDI is bounded by a constant, we derive a scaling law between B and P that is necessary to maintain a constant secrecy rate loss compared to the perfect CDI case.

For secondary users, sensing costs are incurred as the result of primary users' activity. Furthermore, each secondary user pays the cost of transmission upon successful bidding for a channel. Knowledge regarding other secondary users' activity is limited due to the distributed nature of the network. The resulting formulation is thus a dynamic game with incomplete information. To solve such a problem, a Bayesian nonparametric belief update scheme is constructed based on the Dirichlet process. Efficient bidding learning algorithms are proposed via which users can decide whether or not to participate in the bidding according to the belief update. Properties of optimal bidding and initial bidding are proved. As demonstrated through extensive simulations, the proposed distributed scheme outperforms a myopic one-stage algorithm, and can achieve a good trade-off between long-term efficiency and fairness.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeated Auctions with Bayesian Nonparametric Learning for Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.010411.100838","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5732655/05692900.pdf","startPage":"890","endPage":"900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.010411.100838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5732655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Repeated Auctions with Bayesian Nonparametric Learning for Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5692900/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11874715","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeated Auctions with Bayesian Nonparametric Learning for Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"0890-tw1103-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108128S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5732655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5732655","articleId":"5692900","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5692901,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37304555100"},{"name":"Shalinee Kishore","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Shalinee","lastName":"Kishore","id":"37269549900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5692901","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1469},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Shadow mapping","Wireless sensor networks","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","probability","sensor fusion","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive radio networks","spectrum measurements","fusion center","correlated log-normal shadowing","optimal beamforming weights","global detection probability","global transmit power constraint","global detection performance","linear equidistant network analysis","identical channel gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sensing","beamforming","cognitive radio networks"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a cooperative spectrum sensing scheme with beamforming for cognitive radio networks.

Our Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate performance gains through adaptive bit and power loading over conventional non-adaptive systems as well as currently available adaptive cooperative scheme in the literature.

In return, SUs get an opportunity to access spare channels for their own data transmission. Initially, we assume that the CR network supports payment transfer. Then, we formulate the system as a transferable utility coalitional game. We show that there is an operating point that maximizes the sum utility over all operators and SUs while providing each player a share such that no subset of operators and SUs has an incentive to break away from the grand coalition. Such operating points exist when the solution set of the game, the core, is nonempty. Subsequently, we examine an interesting scenario where there is no payment mechanism in the network. This scenario can be investigated by using a nontransferable utility coalitional game model. We show that there exists a joint action to make the core nonempty. A general method with exponential computational complexity to get such a joint action is discussed. Then, we relate the core of this game to a competitive equilibrium of an exchange economy setting under special situations. As a result, several available efficient centralized or distributed algorithms in economics can be employed to compute a member in the core. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the design of new coalition based dynamics that could be used in future CR networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11879160","htmlLink":"/document/5692976/","displayDocTitle":"Coalitional Game Theoretic Approach for Secondary Spectrum Access in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coalitional Game Theoretic Approach for Secondary Spectrum Access in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"0844-tw1103-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11789S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5732655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5732655","articleId":"5692976","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5692977,"authors":[{"name":"Homa Eghbali","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Homa","lastName":"Eghbali","id":"38269148200"},{"name":"Sami Muhaidat","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Muhaidat","id":"37393377900"},{"name":"Naofal Al-Dhahir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Naofal","lastName":"Al-Dhahir","id":"37269044000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5692977","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1234},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692977","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Strontium","Frequency domain analysis","Rician channels","Broadband antennas","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","broadband networks","least mean squares methods","matched filters","multipath channels","radio networks","radio receivers","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver design","single-carrier frequency domain equalization","broadband wireless networks","amplify-and-forward relaying","minimum mean square error","MMSE","relay-assisted transmission scenario","linear processing techniques","multipath diversity gains","perfect power control","signal-to-noise ratio","source-to-relay links","relay-to-destination links","frequency selective Rician fading","matched filter bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single-carrier frequency domain equalization","cooperative diversity","distributed space-time block coding(STBC)","equalization","fading channels","pairwise error probability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an efficient receiver design for single carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) for relay-assisted transmission scenario over frequency selective channels.

However, since practical wireless channels typically exhibit a time-correlated property, we need to take into account the effects of time correlation in the design of HARQ. In this paper, we analyze the outage probability and delay-limited throughput of HARQ with rate adaptation in a time-correlated channel model. Then, we propose a rate adaptation scheme to maximize the delay-limited throughput and evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under a delay constraint. Our analytical and numerical results show that the proposed rate adaptation scheme outperforms the conventional rate adaptation schemes. The proposed rate adaptation scheme is further simplified by using a Gaussian approximation on the effective channel power gain. The rate adaptation based on the proposed Gaussian approximation reduces the complexity and achieves a throughput gain comparable to that with the exact channel distributions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.011111.101027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5732655/05692978.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.011111.101027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5732655","startPage":"968","endPage":"979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Rate Adaptation for Hybrid ARQ in Time-Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5692978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Rate Adaptation for Hybrid ARQ in Time-Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5692978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11874718","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5692978/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Rate Adaptation for Hybrid ARQ in Time-Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"0968-tw1103-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07111S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5732655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5732655","articleId":"5692978","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5692979,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China","Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5732655/5692979/5692979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Yang received the B.S. degree in communications engineering from Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China, in 2006.

Our approach first extracts the motion models thanks to a RANSAC-based random sampling algorithm improved by the use of geodesic distance information. Then those models are assigned to pixels in the color image by minimizing an energy functional thanks to graph-cut. Our energy takes into account motion residuals, color distributions, geodesic distance as well as temporal consistency of the layers. Moreover, we define a smoothness term that enforces a patch-wise spatial coherency on areas where optical flow is reliable and a pixel-wise coherency on occluded areas. The method leads to promising results on the tested sequences.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Optical imaging","Image color analysis","Motion segmentation","Labeling","Adaptive optics","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image motion analysis","image segmentation","image sequences","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised motion layer segmentation","energy minimization","video sequences","RANSAC based random sampling algorithm","geodesic distance information","graph cut"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video segmentation","motion layers","graph cut","geodesic distance","random sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVMP.2010.25","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference on Visual Media Production","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference on Visual Media Production","pdfPath":"/iel5/5688738/5693087/05693105.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVMP.2010.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Motion Layer Segmentation by Random Sampling and Energy Minimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Motion Layer Segmentation by Random Sampling and Energy Minimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693105/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693105/","accessionNumber":"11764101","conferenceDate":"17-18 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Nov. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Motion Layer Segmentation by Random Sampling and Energy Minimization","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"4268a141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056342S","chronDate":"17-18 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5688738","isNumber":"5693087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5688738","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5693087","articleId":"5693105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5693133,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We show that the Amazon EC2 cloud offers better performance and value for processor- and memory-limited applications than for I/O-bound applications. We provide an example of how the cloud is well suited to the generation of a science product: an atlas of period grams for the 210,000 light curves released by the NASA Kepler Mission.

However, non-functional requirements, which are important for building user-satisfied software systems and have impacts on the software design, are not sufficiently considered in current MDD methods. This paper proposes an approach to modeling non-functional requirements, analyzing their impacts to the design and making a complement to the original design models for the MDD methods. First, existing UML models of the application's functional properties are taken as an input of the NFR modeling process, and with a NFR repository, the NFRs are refined and operationalized. Then based on the analysis result, modeling constructs are created to implement them, and the original UML models are reversely augmented by the result of NFR modeling. In particular, a metamodel is proposed to model the new constructs and facilitate the integration process. With this approach, we can finally get an integrated design model considering both functional requirements and non-functional requirements. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated with an example of the design of a simplified credit card system.","doi":"10.1109/APSEC.2010.21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2010.21","startPage":"98","endPage":"107","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5689842/5693172/05693185.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Non-functional Requirement Modeling into Model Driven Development Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Non-functional Requirement Modeling into Model Driven Development Method","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693185/","accessionNumber":"11770278","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693185/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Non-functional Requirement Modeling into Model Driven Development Method","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4266a098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086251S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5689842","isNumber":"5693172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5689842","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5693172","articleId":"5693185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5693246,"authors":[{"name":"Anja Strunk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Institute of Systems Architecture Chair of Computer Networks, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Anja","lastName":"Strunk","id":"37671273100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9397-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5693246","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":120,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1791},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Time factors","Optimization","Availability","Classification algorithms","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS aware service composition","Internet of service","quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QoS-aware Service Composition","Service Composition","Binding"]}],"abstract":"Service compositions build new services by orchestrating a set of existing services.

This paper summarizes, classifies and evaluates major research efforts in this area and gives an overview about further open research questions.","doi":"10.1109/ECOWS.2010.16","publicationTitle":"2010 Eighth IEEE European Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Eighth IEEE European Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691022/5693237/05693246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECOWS.2010.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693237","startPage":"67","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Service Composition: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Service Composition: A Survey","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693246/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771525","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5693246/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Service Composition: A Survey","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"4310a067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064724S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691022","isNumber":"5693237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691022","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5693237","articleId":"5693246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5693284,"authors":[{"name":"Ariella Richardson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bar-llan University, Israel"],"firstName":"Ariella","lastName":"Richardson","id":"37997688600"},{"name":"Gal Kaminka","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bar-llan University, Israel"],"firstName":"Gal","lastName":"Kaminka","id":"37284991800"},{"name":"Sarit Kraus","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bar-llan University, Israel"],"firstName":"Sarit","lastName":"Kraus","id":"37285129900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9244-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4257-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-9232"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"5693284","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693284","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Itemsets","Nonlinear distortion","Data mining","Rate distortion theory","Computational modeling","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","pattern classification","sampling methods","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CUBS","multivariate temporal sequence classification","bounded z-score","z-score normalization","pruning","itemset mining algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multivariate Sequence Mining","Mining Multiple Information Sources","Classification","Sampling"]}],"abstract":"Multivariate temporal sequence classification is an important and challenging task. Several attempts to address this problem exist, but none provide a full solution. In this paper we present CUBS: Classification Using Bounded Z-Score with Sampling. CUBS uses item set mining to produce frequent subsequences, and then selects among them the statistically significant subsequences to compose a classification model. We introduce an improved item set mining algorithm that solves the short sequence bias present in many item set mining algorithms. Unfortunately, the z-score normalization hinders pruning. We provide a bound on the z-score to address this issue. Calculation of the z-score normalization requires knowledge of some statistical values of the data gathered using a small sample of the database. The sampling causes a distortion in the values. We analyze this distortion and correct it. We evaluate CUBS for accuracy and scalability on a synthetic dataset and on two real world dataset. The results demonstrate how short subsequence bias is solved in the mining, and show how our bound and sampling technique enable speedup.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2010.38","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691154/5693274/05693284.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2010.38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CUBS: Multivariate Sequence Classification Using Bounded Z-score with Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"CUBS: Multivariate Sequence Classification Using Bounded Z-score with Sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5693284/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771627","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693284/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CUBS: Multivariate Sequence Classification Using Bounded Z-score with Sampling","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4257a072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048189S","chronDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691154","isNumber":"5693274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691154","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5693274","articleId":"5693284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5693292,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Chang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Chang","id":"37858849900"},{"name":"Jun Luo","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Luo","id":"37537086000"},{"name":"Joshua Zhexue Huang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Joshua Zhexue","lastName":"Huang","id":"37081979900"},{"name":"Shengzhong Feng","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Shengzhong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37552789200"},{"name":"Jianping Fan","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Fan","id":"37329952600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9244-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4257-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-9232"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"5693292","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":532},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computational modeling","Measurement","Data models","Data mining","Accuracy","Distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum spanning tree","MapReduce implementation","classification model","massive data","cloud computing","graph-based mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["classification","minimum spanning tree","graph-based mining","MapReduce","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Rapid growth of data has provided us with more information, yet challenges the tradition techniques to extract the useful knowledge. In this paper, we propose MCMM, a Minimum spanning tree (MST) based Classification model for Massive data with MapReduce implementation. It can be viewed as an intermediate model between the traditional K nearest neighbor method and cluster based classification method, aiming to overcome their disadvantages and cope with large amount of data. Our model is implemented on Hadoop platform, using its MapReduce programming framework, which is particular suitable for cloud computing. We have done experiments on several data sets including real world data from UCI repository and synthetic data, using Downing 4000 clusters, installed with Hadoop. The results show that our model outperforms KNN and some other classification methods on a general basis with respect to accuracy and scalability.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2010.14","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691154/5693274/05693292.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2010.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Spanning Tree Based Classification Model for Massive Data with MapReduce Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693292/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Spanning Tree Based Classification Model for Massive Data with MapReduce Implementation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771632","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693292/","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Spanning Tree Based Classification Model for Massive Data with MapReduce Implementation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4257a129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061352S","chronDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691154","isNumber":"5693274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691154","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5693274","articleId":"5693292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5693297,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Neumeyer","affiliation":["Yahoo Research Laboratories, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Neumeyer","id":"37993629900"},{"name":"Bruce Robbins","affiliation":["Yahoo Research Laboratories, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Robbins","id":"38011829600"},{"name":"Anish Nair","affiliation":["Yahoo Research Laboratories, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anish","lastName":"Nair","id":"38004813400"},{"name":"Anand Kesari","affiliation":["Yahoo Research Laboratories, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Kesari","id":"37992315500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9244-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4257-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-9232"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"5693297","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":506,"citationCountPatent":18,"totalDownloads":3537},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Real time systems","Engines","Servers","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data encapsulation","data mining","distributed processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","media streaming","query processing","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed stream computing","data events","processing elements","semantics","encapsulation","location transparency","programming interface","S4 architecture","data mining","machine learning","actors programming model","complex event processing","simple scalable streaming system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["actors programming model","complex event processing","concurrent programming","data processing","distributed programming","map-reduce","middleware","parallel programming","real-time search","software design","stream computing"]}],"abstract":"S4 is a general-purpose, distributed, scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous unbounded streams of data.

The architecture resembles the Actors model, providing semantics of encapsulation and location transparency, thus allowing applications to be massively concurrent while exposing a simple programming interface to application developers. In this paper, we outline the S4 architecture in detail, describe various applications, including real-life deployments. Our design is primarily driven by large scale applications for data mining and machine learning in a production environment. We show that the S4 design is surprisingly flexible and lends itself to run in large clusters built with commodity hardware.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2010.172","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691154/5693274/05693297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2010.172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693274","startPage":"170","endPage":"177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"S4: Distributed Stream Computing Platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"S4: Distributed Stream Computing Platform","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693297/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771636","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5693297/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"S4: Distributed Stream Computing Platform","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4257a170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048867S","chronDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691154","isNumber":"5693274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691154","citationCount":"506","xplore-issue":"5693274","articleId":"5693297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5693344,"authors":[{"name":"Vilaythong Southavilay","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Vilaythong","lastName":"Southavilay","id":"37992098800"},{"name":"Kalina Yacef","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Kalina","lastName":"Yacef","id":"37352362000"},{"name":"Rafael A.

We used a heuristic to derive semantic interpretation of specific sequences of raw data and Markov models (MM) to derive the processes. We propose two models, a Heuristic MM and a Hidden MM for analysing student's writing behavior. We also refined the semantic preprocessing by adding the notion of pauses between activities.

Today, most international financial institutions have been implementing anti-money laundering solutions but traditional investigative techniques consume numerous man-hours. Besides, most of the existing commercial solutions are based on statistics such as means and standard deviations and therefore are not efficient enough, especially for detecting suspicious cases in investment activities. In this paper, we present a case study of applying a knowledge-based solution that combines data mining and natural computing techniques to detect money laundering patterns.

One such application domain is activity discovery and recognition. Activity discovery and recognition is used in many real world systems, such as assisted living and security systems, and it has been vastly studied in recent years. However, the temporal features and relations which provide useful insights for activity models have not been exploited to their full potential by mining algorithms. In this paper, we propose a temporal model for discovering temporal features and relations of activity patterns from sensor data. Our algorithm is able to discover features and relations, such as the order of the activities, their usual start times and durations by using rule mining and clustering techniques. The algorithm has been validated using 4 months of data collected in a smart home.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2010.164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693274","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691154/5693274/05693413.pdf","endPage":"1075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering Temporal Features and Relations of Activity Patterns","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2010.164","startPage":"1069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Discovering Temporal Features and Relations of Activity Patterns","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693413/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11791603","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5693413/","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Temporal Features and Relations of Activity Patterns","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4257b069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066213S","chronDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691154","isNumber":"5693274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691154","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5693274","articleId":"5693413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5693425,"authors":[{"name":"Francesc J.

Subspace selection method tries to select boundary samples of each class convex hull by iteratively absorbing the furthest sample to the subspace of chosen samples.

In this paper, we explore different ways to improve upon the efficiency and accuracy of the basic DTW algorithm. Central to our work is the concept of adaptive down sampling using trace segmentation. We describe how the size of the data being compared can be reduced substantially with limited loss of information by down sampling slowly changing parts of the signals much more than rapidly changing regions. We propose two novel measures based on the notion of adaptive down sampling: trace profile comparison (TPC), which compares the reduced representations obtained by adaptive down sampling using a weighting scheme that assesses the relative importance of changes in amplitude and timing, and piecewise linear DTW (PLDTW), which compares piecewise linear segments of the reduced signals using a modified dynamic programming algorithm and cost function. When evaluated on the UCR Time Series dataset, TPC provided an improvement in runtime over the basic DTW algorithm and recent optimizations to it, while PLDTW improved the accuracy of DTW for classification in different datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2010.94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2010.94","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1311","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691154/5693274/05693444.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Adaptive Downsampling to Compare Time Series with Warping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Using Adaptive Downsampling to Compare Time Series with Warping","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693444/","accessionNumber":"11771600","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693444/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Adaptive Downsampling to Compare Time Series with Warping","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4257b304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055474S","chronDate":"13-13 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691154","isNumber":"5693274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691154","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5693274","articleId":"5693444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5693503,"authors":[{"name":"Tong-Hua Su","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tong-Hua","lastName":"Su","id":"37588170300"},{"name":"Cheng-Lin Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng-Lin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280620800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8353-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5693503","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Handwriting recognition","Training","Databases","Feature extraction","Speech recognition","Text recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","handwritten character recognition","hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta feature","synthesized string sample","HMM-based segmentation-free strategy","Chinese handwriting recognition performance","character boundary","isolated character image","character sample","bigram language model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693503","abstract":"The HMM-based segmentation-free strategy for Chinese handwriting recognition has the advantage of training without annotation of character boundaries.

First, Delta features are added to the static ones for alleviating the conditional independence assumption of HMMs. We then investigate into techniques for synthesizing string samples from isolated character images. We show that synthesizing linguistically natural string samples utilizes isolated samples insufficiently. Instead, we draw character samples without replacement and concatenate them into string images through between-character gaps. Our experimental results demonstrate that both Delta features and synthesized string samples significantly improve the recognition performance. Combining these with a bigram language model, the recognition accuracy has been increased by 36~38% compared to our previous system.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2010.18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2010.18","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691353/5693490/05693503.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving HMM-Based Chinese Handwriting Recognition Using Delta Features and Synthesized String Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improving HMM-Based Chinese Handwriting Recognition Using Delta Features and Synthesized String Samples","conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693503/","accessionNumber":"11771826","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693503/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving HMM-Based Chinese Handwriting Recognition Using Delta Features and Synthesized String Samples","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"4221a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049066S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691353","isNumber":"5693490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691353","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5693490","articleId":"5693503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5693515,"authors":[{"name":"Szilard Vajda","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Szilard","lastName":"Vajda","id":"37270040600"},{"name":"Gernot A.

Storing scanned pages of written text can save the information from degradation, but it does not make the textual information readily available. Automatic keyword spotting systems for handwritten historic documents can fill this gap. However, most such systems have trouble with the great variety of writing styles. It is not uncommon for handwriting processing systems to be built for just a single book. In this paper we show that neural network based keyword spotting systems are flexible enough to be used successfully on historic data, even when they are trained on a modern handwriting database. We demonstrate that with little transcribed historic text, added to the training set, the performance can further be enhanced.","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691353/5693490/05693548.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapting BLSTM Neural Network Based Keyword Spotting Trained on Modern Data to Historical Documents","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2010.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2010.61","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adapting BLSTM Neural Network Based Keyword Spotting Trained on Modern Data to Historical Documents","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771859","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5693548/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapting BLSTM Neural Network Based Keyword Spotting Trained on Modern Data to Historical Documents","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"4221a352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076434S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691353","isNumber":"5693490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691353","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5693490","articleId":"5693548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5693553,"authors":[{"name":"Xianjiang Meng","affiliation":["College of Communication science and engineering, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xianjiang","lastName":"Meng","id":"37899396200"},{"name":"Xianli Meng","affiliation":["China Mobile Group Telecommunication Design, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xianli","lastName":"Meng","id":"37899396300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8548-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4249-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5693553","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693553","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks","Testing","Nonlinear systems","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","biology computing","digital simulation","neural nets","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear system simulation","BP neural network","input layer neurons","hidden layer neurons","input layer number","output layer neuron number","human brain nervous system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","BP network","simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICINIS.2010.159","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692187/5693550/05693553.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Third International Conference on Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Third International Conference on Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Systems","startPage":"334","endPage":"337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINIS.2010.159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear System Simulation Based on the BP Neural Network","abstract":"In order to simulate a nonlinear system, A BP neural network can be used.

In this paper we present a new approach to online Bangla handwriting recognition and one of the first to consider cursively written words instead of isolated characters. Our method uses a sub-stroke level feature representation of the script and a writing model based on hidden Markov models. As for the latter an appropriate internal structure is crucial, we investigate different approaches to defining model structures for a highly compositional script like Bangla.

The stator flux observer is a key part in the method. The accuracy of the stator flux estimation directly affected the performance of DTC. The traditional induction motor stator flux observation method have been analyzed in This paper. And for the shortcomings of existing methods, a on-line identification methods based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) have been proposed in the paper. First, the type reference model to flux identification has been established according to induction motor u-n mathematical model under the static coordinate system. Then, a RBF neural network can be constructed on this basis. After self-organization learning, on-line identification of stator flux can be realized in the RBF neural network. System simulation has been carried out in Matlab/Simulink.

communication systems need higher wireless capacity. Multi-user detection (MUD) technique is one of the key techniques in Code Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) system. This technique can reduce the multiple access interference (MAI) and inter symbol interference (ISI) by using the structured information at the receiving end in the CDMA system, and it can also realize the information demodulation while there exist multi-user signals. This paper presents a new Multi-user detection technique, that is simulated annealing-genetic algorithm. This proposed algorithm applies simulated annealing (SA) to genetic algorithm (GA). First, the initial group is given, then the genetic algorithm is used to make the search gradually convergent to the feasible globally optimal solution or sub-optimal solution, then the simulated annealing is used to do the local optimization. Simulations show that the proposed multi-user detector is close to the optimal one and better than the conventional one in the performance of anti-MAI and anti-ISI.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693785/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11773386","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693785/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulated Annealing-Genetic Algorithm and Its Application in CDMA Multi-user Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulated Annealing-Genetic Algorithm and Its Application in CDMA Multi-user Detection","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"4249a638.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039907S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692187","isNumber":"5693550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692187","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5693550","articleId":"5693785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5693816,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos M.

We present a network model and a video model that capture the network conditions and video characteristics, respectively. We develop an integer program for deterministic packet scheduling. We propose different cost functions in order to provide service differentiation and address fairness among users. We propose several suboptimal convex problems for randomized packet scheduling, and study their performance and complexity. We propose an algorithm that yields a good performance and is suitable for real-time applications. We conduct extensive trace-driven simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithms using real network conditions and scalable video streams.

For example, the video frame rate and the underlying bandwidth usage have a strong performance dependency. Performance dependencies must also be considered among distributed components. These dependencies over a time-span form correlation relationships. Violations of such correlation relationships represent collective anomalies. Users and most specifically DIME application developers face problems of finding (detecting), localizing such anomalies, and adapting against them in real-time. Current practices are to collect joint application-system metadata characterizing behaviors of application and system components while a DIME session is running, and then analyze them offline. Our goal is to provide a framework, called DIAMOND, that allows for real-time and unobtrusive collection and organization of joint application-system metadata in order to assist in finding such correlation violations in the system. DIAMOND works in four steps: (a) real-time metadata collection, (b) metadata processing to allow efficient computation of correlation constraints, (c) metadata distribution for efficient clustering of distributed metadata, and (d) anomaly detection, localization, and evolution monitoring based on violations of correlation relationships. Our results from real implementations and simulations with Planet Lab traces show the effectiveness of DIAMOND in terms of network overhead and anomaly detection time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692178/5693814/05693833.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2010.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2010.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DIAMOND: Correlation-Based Anomaly Monitoring Daemon for DIME","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Diamond-like carbon","Discrete Fourier transforms","Monitoring","Hypercubes","Real time systems","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","multimedia computing","real-time systems","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation based anomaly monitoring","DIME","distributed interactive multimedia environments","joint application-system","distributed metadata","anomaly detection","evolution monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QoS","Distributed Interactive Multimedia Systems","Correlations","Anomaly"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"DIAMOND: Correlation-Based Anomaly Monitoring Daemon for DIME","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693833/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771922","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DIAMOND: Correlation-Based Anomaly Monitoring Daemon for DIME","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4217a137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103098S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692178","isNumber":"5693814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692178","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5693814","articleId":"5693833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5693841,"authors":[{"name":"Minoru Mori","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Mori","id":"37534131500"},{"name":"Kunio Kashino","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kunio","lastName":"Kashino","id":"37271674500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8672-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4217-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5693841","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":685},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693841","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Correlation","Complexity theory","Robustness","Equations","Lighting","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","motion estimation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast template matching","normalized cross correlation","initial threshold estimation","image variation","illumination change","sum of absolute difference","adaptive block partitioning","multilevel successive elimination algorithm","template position"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Template matching","Successive elimination","Adaptive block partitioning","Initial threshold estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISM.2010.36","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692178/5693814/05693841.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2010.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Template Matching Based on Normalized Cross Correlation Using Adaptive Block Partitioning and Initial Threshold Estimation","abstract":"This paper proposes a fast template matching method based on normalized cross correlation (NCC).

To deal with this problem, we use adaptive block partitioning and initial threshold estimation to extend the multilevel successive elimination algorithm. Adaptive block partitioning provides efficient sub-block partitioning and tighter boundaries. Initial threshold estimation yields a larger boundary threshold. They greatly suppress the number of search points at an earlier level from the beginning of search. The proposed method is exhaustive and robust with respect to template position and size.

In this paper, we study influence maximization in the linear threshold model, one of the important models formalizing the behavior of influence propagation in social networks. We first show that computing exact influence in general networks in the linear threshold model is #P-hard, which closes an open problem left in the seminal work on influence maximization by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos, 2003. As a contrast, we show that computing influence in directed a cyclic graphs (DAGs) can be done in time linear to the size of the graphs. Based on the fast computation in DAGs, we propose the first scalable influence maximization algorithm tailored for the linear threshold model. We conduct extensive simulations to show that our algorithm is scalable to networks with millions of nodes and edges, is orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approximation algorithm proposed by Kempe et al. and its optimized versions, and performs consistently among the best algorithms while other heuristic algorithms not design specifically for the linear threshold model have unstable performances on different real-world networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05693962.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Influence Maximization in Social Networks under the Linear Threshold Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Greedy algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Social network services","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","directed graphs","greedy algorithms","optimisation","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable influence maximization algorithm","social networks","linear threshold model","#P-hard","directed acyclic graphs","greedy approximation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["influence maximization","social networks","linear threshold model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Influence Maximization in Social Networks under the Linear Threshold Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693962/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770525","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Influence Maximization in Social Networks under the Linear Threshold Model","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256a088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071529S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"430","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5693962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5693966,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy de Vries","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"de Vries","id":"37995295100"},{"name":"Sanjay Chawla","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Chawla","id":"37283171000"},{"name":"Michael E.

We investigate the use of Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for data of this type, providing a motivating example from real world data. We propose Projection-Indexed Nearest-Neighbours (PINN), a novel technique that exploits extended nearest neighbour sets in the a reduced dimensional space to create an accurate approximation for k-nearest-neighbour distances, which is used as the core density measurement within LOF. The reduced dimensionality allows for efficient sub-quadratic indexing in the number of items in the data set, where previously only quadratic performance was possible. A detailed theoretical analysis of Random Projection(RP) and PINN shows that we are able to preserve the density of the intrinsic manifold of the data set after projection. Experimental results show that PINN outperforms the standard projection methods RP and PCA when measuring LOF for many high-dimensional real-world data sets of up to 300000 elements and 102600 dimensions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding Local Anomalies in Very High Dimensional Space","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.151","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05693966.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Finding Local Anomalies in Very High Dimensional Space","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5693966/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770529","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding Local Anomalies in Very High Dimensional Space","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256a128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082244S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5693966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5693971,"authors":[{"name":"Zeno Gantner","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, University of Hildesheim, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Zeno","lastName":"Gantner","id":"38273889600"},{"name":"Lucas Drumond","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, University of Hildesheim, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Drumond","id":"37312998400"},{"name":"Christoph Freudenthaler","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, University of Hildesheim, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Freudenthaler","id":"38274490100"},{"name":"Steffen Rendle","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, University of Hildesheim, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Rendle","id":"37832314100"},{"name":"Lars Schmidt-Thieme","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, University of Hildesheim, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Schmidt-Thieme","id":"38276650400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9131-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4256-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-4786"}],"articleNumber":"5693971","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1882},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion pictures","Data models","Computational modeling","Collaboration","Training","Mathematical model","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix decomposition","recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recommender system","matrix factorization","attribute-to-feature mapping","cold-start recommendation","new-item problem","new-user problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["collaborative filtering","cold-start","matrix factorization","factorization models","long tail","recommender systems"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Attribute-to-Feature Mappings for Cold-Start Recommendations","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","endPage":"185","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05693971.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.129","startPage":"176","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693971","abstract":"Cold-start scenarios in recommender systems are situations in which no prior events, like ratings or clicks, are known for certain users or items.

With such mappings, the factors of a MF model trained by standard techniques can be applied to the new-user and the new-item problem, while retaining its advantages, in particular speed and predictive accuracy.

Our method takes deterministic constant time per non-zero weight, improving on the best previous approach which takes expected constant time. The samples can be used as Weighted Minhash for efficient retrieval and compression (sketching) under Jaccard or L1 metric. A method is presented for using simple data statistics to reduce the running time of hash computation by two orders of magnitude. We compare our method with the random projection method and show that it has better characteristics for retrieval under L1. We present a novel method of mapping hashes to short bit-strings, apply it to Weighted Minhash, and achieve more accurate distance estimates from sketches than existing methods, as long as the inputs are sufficiently distinct. We show how to choose the optimal number of bits per hash for sketching, and demonstrate experimental results which agree with the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5693978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770541","htmlLink":"/document/5693978/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improved Consistent Sampling, Weighted Minhash and L1 Sketching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Consistent Sampling, Weighted Minhash and L1 Sketching","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256a246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052027S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5693978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694060,"authors":[{"name":"Yanchi Liu","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China","MSIS Department, Rutgers Business School, Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Yanchi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405154500"},{"name":"Zhongmou Li","affiliation":["MSIS Department, Rutgers Business School, Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongmou","lastName":"Li","id":"38007013700"},{"name":"Hui Xiong","affiliation":["MSIS Department, Rutgers Business School, Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37279752600"},{"name":"Xuedong Gao","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuedong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403255400"},{"name":"Junjie Wu","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Beihang University, China"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37537242000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9131-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4256-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-4786"}],"articleNumber":"5694060","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":328,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3728},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Noise","Clustering algorithms","Noise measurement","Current measurement","Elbow","Economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal clustering validation","clustering application","crisp clustering","S_Dbw"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.35","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05694060.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding of Internal Clustering Validation Measures","abstract":"Clustering validation has long been recognized as one of the vital issues essential to the success of clustering applications.

Most existing research approaches this problem by exploring the topological structure of a social network using only one source of information. However, in many application domains, in addition to the social network of interest, there are a number of auxiliary social networks and/or derived proximity networks available. The contribution of the paper is twofold: (1) a supervised learning framework that can effectively and efficiently learn the dynamics of social networks in the presence of auxiliary networks, (2) a feature design scheme for constructing a rich variety of path-based features using multiple sources, and an effective feature selection strategy based on structured sparsity. Extensive experiments on three real-world collaboration networks show that our model can effectively learn to predict new links using multiple sources, yielding higher prediction accuracy than unsupervised and single-source supervised models.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05694062.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"928","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Link Prediction Using Multiple Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Link Prediction Using Multiple Sources","htmlLink":"/document/5694062/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11770461","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Link Prediction Using Multiple Sources","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256a923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055908S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5694062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5694063,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad M.

Two such well studied aspects are infinite length and concept-drift. Since a data stream may be considered a continuous process, which is theoretically infinite in length, it is impractical to store and use all the historical data for training. Data streams also frequently experience concept-drift as a result of changes in the underlying concepts. However, another important characteristic of data streams, namely, concept-evolution is rarely addressed in the literature. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream. This paper addresses concept-evolution in addition to the existing challenges of infinite-length and concept-drift. In this paper, the concept-evolution phenomenon is studied, and the insights are used to construct superior novel class detection techniques. First, we propose an adaptive threshold for outlier detection, which is a vital part of novel class detection. Second, we propose a probabilistic approach for novel class detection using discrete Gini Coefficient, and prove its effectiveness both theoretically and empirically. Finally, we address the issue of simultaneous multiple novel class occurrence, and provide an elegant solution to detect more than one novel classes at the same time. We also consider feature-evolution in text data streams, which occurs because new features (i.e., words) evolve in the stream. Comparison with state-of-the-art data stream classification techniques establishes the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5694063/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11770462","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Addressing Concept-Evolution in Concept-Drifting Data Streams","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Addressing Concept-Evolution in Concept-Drifting Data Streams","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256a929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.174239S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5694063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5694067,"authors":[{"name":"Keith Noto","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Noto","id":"37667144000"},{"name":"Carly Brodley","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Carly","lastName":"Brodley","id":"37087398472"},{"name":"Donna Slonim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Donna","lastName":"Slonim","id":"37296726800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9131-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4256-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-4786"}],"articleNumber":"5694067","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":449},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694067","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Kernel","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","feature model","feature space","semisupervised learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","machine learning","feature selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.140","endPage":"958","startPage":"953","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05694067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Using an Ensemble of Feature Models","abstract":"We present a new approach to semi-supervised anomaly detection. Given a set of training examples believed to come from the same distribution or class, the task is to learn a model that will be able to distinguish examples in the future that do not belong to the same class. Traditional approaches typically compare the position of a new data point to the set of ``normal'' training data points in a chosen representation of the feature space. For some data sets, the normal data may not have discernible positions in feature space, but do have consistent relationships among some features that fail to appear in the anomalous examples. Our approach learns to predict the values of training set features from the values of other features. After we have formed an ensemble of predictors, we apply this ensemble to new data points. To combine the contribution of each predictor in our ensemble, we have developed a novel, information-theoretic anomaly measure that our experimental results show selects against noisy and irrelevant features. Our results on 47 data sets show that for most data sets, this approach significantly improves performance over current state-of-the-art feature space distance and density-based approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694067/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694067/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11770467","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","pubMedId":"22020249","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Using an Ensemble of Feature Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection Using an Ensemble of Feature Models","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256a953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086792S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5694067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694074,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Rendle","affiliation":["Department of Reasoning of Intelligence, Osaka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Rendle","id":"37832314100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9131-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4256-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-4786"}],"articleNumber":"5694074","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":554,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":7549},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Support vector machines","Frequency modulation","Predictive models","Data models","Equations","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","matrix decomposition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["factorization machine","support vector machine","SVM","model parameters","parameter estimation","feature vector","sparse data","tensor factorization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["factorization machine","sparse data","tensor factorization","support vector machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694074","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines (FM) which are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with factorization models. Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.127","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05694074.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"1000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Factorization Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Factorization Machines","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11770473","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694074/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694074/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factorization Machines","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256a995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040845S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"554","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5694074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694075,"authors":[{"name":"Doruk Sart","affiliation":["University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Doruk","lastName":"Sart","id":"37992838400"},{"name":"Abdullah Mueen","affiliation":["University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Mueen","id":"37671282900"},{"name":"Walid Najjar","affiliation":["University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Najjar","id":"37268700700"},{"name":"Eamonn Keogh","affiliation":["University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Eamonn","lastName":"Keogh","id":"37283167600"},{"name":"Vit Niennattrakul","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Vit","lastName":"Niennattrakul","id":"37294494700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9131-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4256-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-4786"}],"articleNumber":"5694075","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":999},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Instruction sets","Field programmable gate arrays","Graphics processing unit","Clocks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","data mining","field programmable gate arrays","search problems","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic time warping subsequence search","GPU","FPGA","time series data mining","subroutine","DTW subsequence search","subsequence similarity search","lower-bound based pruning","early abandoning strategy","graphics processing unit","field programmable gate array","astronomical observation classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time series","similarity search","dynamic time warping","FPGA","GPU"]}],"abstract":"Many time series data mining problems require subsequence similarity search as a subroutine. Dozens of similarity/distance measures have been proposed in the last decade and there is increasing evidence that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the best measure across a wide range of domains. Given DTW's usefulness and ubiquity, there has been a large community-wide effort to mitigate its relative lethargy. Proposed speedup techniques include early abandoning strategies, lower-bound based pruning, indexing and embedding. In this work we argue that we are now close to exhausting all possible speedup from software, and that we must turn to hardware-based solutions. With this motivation, we investigate both GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based acceleration of subsequence similarity search under the DTW measure. As we shall show, our novel algorithms allow GPUs to achieve two orders of magnitude speedup and FPGAs to produce four orders of magnitude speedup. We conduct detailed case studies on the classification of astronomical observations and demonstrate that our ideas allow us to tackle problems that would be untenable otherwise.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.21","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05694075.pdf","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Dynamic Time Warping Subsequence Search with GPUs and FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694075/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Dynamic Time Warping Subsequence Search with GPUs and FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694075/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770474","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Dynamic Time Warping Subsequence Search with GPUs and FPGAs","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256b001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115792S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5694075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5694086,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Sun","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Informatics, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Sun","id":"38004429000"},{"name":"Hisashi Kashima","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Informatics, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisashi","lastName":"Kashima","id":"37311824300"},{"name":"Takuya Matsuzaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Matsuzaki","id":"38005263000"},{"name":"Naonori Ueda","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Naonori","lastName":"Ueda","id":"37279755800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9131-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4256-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-4786"}],"articleNumber":"5694086","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Convergence","Accuracy","Robustness","Stochastic processes","Acceleration","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","data mining","feedback","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","stochastic processes","very large databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["averaged stochastic gradient descent","feedback","large datasets","weight vectors","classification","data mining"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.26","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05694086.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.26","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent with Feedback: An Accurate, Robust, and Fast Training Method","abstract":"On large datasets, the popular training approach has been stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This paper proposes a modification of SGD, called averaged SGD with feedback (ASF), that significantly improves the performance (robustness, accuracy, and training speed) over the traditional SGD. The proposal is based on three simple ideas: averaging the weight vectors across SGD iterations, feeding the averaged weights back into the SGD update process, and deciding when to perform the feedback (linearly slowing down feedback). Theoretically, we demonstrate the reasonable convergence properties of the ASF. Empirically, the ASF outperforms several strong baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness over the noise, and the training speed. To our knowledge, this is the first study of ``feedback'' in stochastic gradient learning. Although we choose latent conditional models for verifying the ASF in this paper, the ASF is a general purpose technique just like SGD, and can be directly applied to other models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770485","htmlLink":"/document/5694086/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent with Feedback: An Accurate, Robust, and Fast Training Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent with Feedback: An Accurate, Robust, and Fast Training Method","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256b067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051317S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5694086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694098,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xie","id":"38003869000"},{"name":"Philip S.

Different from traditional level-wise mining or tree-growth strategies, our method works in a top-down manner. We pull large maximal cliques from a pattern graph constructed after some fast initial processing, and directly use such large-sized maximal cliques as promising candidates for long frequent patterns. A separate refinement stage is needed to further transform these candidates into true maximal patterns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11770497","htmlLink":"/document/5694098/","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Max-Clique: A Top-Down Graph-Based Approach to Frequent Pattern Mining","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Max-Clique: A Top-Down Graph-Based Approach to Frequent Pattern Mining","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256b139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051722S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5694098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5694099,"authors":[{"name":"Qingyan Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qingyan","lastName":"Yang","id":"38002429900"},{"name":"Ju Fan","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Fan","id":"37979923500"},{"name":"Jianyong Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianyong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524400"},{"name":"Lizhu Zhou","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lizhu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37332353800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9131-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4256-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-4786"}],"articleNumber":"5694099","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694099","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Web pages","Navigation","Collaboration","Feature extraction","Clustering algorithms","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","groupware","information filtering","Internet","iterative methods","Markov processes","recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative filtering","topic aware Markov model","requested Web pages prediction","personalized Web page recommendation model","PIGEON","graph based iteration algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Page Clustering","Personalized Recommendation","Collaborative Filtering","Markov model"]}],"abstract":"Web-page recommendation is to predict the next request of pages that Web users are potentially interested in when surfing the Web. This technique can guide Web users to find more useful pages without asking for them explicitly and has attracted much attention in the community of Web mining. However, few studies on Web page recommendation consider personalization, which is an indispensable feature to meet various preferences of users. In this paper, we propose a personalized Web page recommendation model called PIGEON (abbr. for PersonalIzed web paGe rEcommendatiON) via collaborative filtering and a topic-aware Markov model. We propose a graph-based iteration algorithm to discover users' interested topics, based on which user similarities are measured. To recommend topically coherent pages, we propose a topic-aware Markov model to learn users' navigation patterns which capture both temporal and topical relevance of pages. A thorough experimental evaluation conducted on a large real dataset demonstrates PIGEON's effectiveness and efficiency.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690658/5693950/05694099.pdf","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1150","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2010.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2010.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5693950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalizing Web Page Recommendation via Collaborative Filtering and Topic-Aware Markov Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Personalizing Web Page Recommendation via Collaborative Filtering and Topic-Aware Markov Model","htmlLink":"/document/5694099/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11770498","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalizing Web Page Recommendation via Collaborative Filtering and Topic-Aware Markov Model","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4256b145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057129S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690658","isNumber":"5693950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690658","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5693950","articleId":"5694099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5694133,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhui Lai","affiliation":["College of Computer and Electronic Information, Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, Maoming, China"],"firstName":"Jinhui","lastName":"Lai","id":"38002907200"},{"name":"Song Liang","affiliation":["College of Computer and Electronic Information, Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, Maoming, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Liang","id":"38001327700"},{"name":"Delong Cui","affiliation":["College of Computer and Electronic Information, Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, Maoming, China"],"firstName":"Delong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37547916800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4136-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5694133","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"abstract":"In order to cope with the shortage of present image encryption algorithm, a novel image encryption algorithm based on chaotic system and fractional Fourier transform is proposed in this paper.

Most of previous work on spectrum trading does not consider security issues. One crucial assumption behind cooperative spectrum trading is that the radio nodes can always be trusted. However, this assumption may not be valid in some networks, especially in hostile environments. In this paper, we propose a secure cooperative spectrum trading scheme based on a reversed Stackelberg game.

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules. A worst-case analysis shows that the saving in hardware resources is achieved with a relatively small buffer space, currently available in cheap, low end, FPGA boards, with no impairment on the resulting throughput.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Protocols","Software","Inspection","Engines","Queueing analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network traffic","NIDS","network intrusion detection system","reconfigurable rule matching core","FPGA-based solution","elastic buffers","worst-case analysis","reprogrammability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694212","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.13","startPage":"10","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694212.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.13","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694212/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Dynamic Reconfiguration for FPGA Based Network Intrusion Detection Systems","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11770327","htmlLink":"/document/5694212/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Dynamic Reconfiguration for FPGA Based Network Intrusion Detection Systems","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080447S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694213,"authors":[{"name":"Henning Sahlbach","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Sahlbach","id":"37391927800"},{"name":"Sean Whitty","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Whitty","id":"37391928200"},{"name":"Oliver Bende","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Bende","id":"37992790300"},{"name":"Rolf Ernst","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Ernst","id":"37297213900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694213","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Field programmable gate arrays","Pixel","Clocks","Image resolution","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobile industry","driver information systems","field programmable gate arrays","image reconstruction","image resolution","microprocessor chips","motion estimation","object detection","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance motion estimation application","weakly-programmable FPGA architecture","computer architectures","advanced driver assistance system","automotive industry","safety-critical applications","sensor data","image processing application","uncompressed image stream","cameras","moving object detection","digital 3D image reconstruction","image resolution","clock frequencies"]}],"abstract":"Computer architectures for advanced driver assistance systems have become increasingly important in the automotive industry. They target safety-critical applications, which process large amounts of incoming sensor data. This is especially the case for image processing applications, which must handle several uncompressed image streams from multiple cameras. As one possible target architecture, FPGAs provide sufficient processing power for complex applications such as lane or object detection. A particularly challenging application is the reliable detection of moving objects, which is the basis for several future driver assistance applications, such as a digital 3D reconstruction of a vehicle's surroundings. This paper presents an advanced Motion Estimation application, which achieves high performance processing of up to 449 FPS for an image resolution of 512 \u00d7 384 pixels. The implementation concept relies on weakly-programmable processing elements and a reconfigurable data path, which allows an efficient exploitation of the FPGA's chip area and clock frequencies, leading to a flexible solution that fits future application requirements.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694213.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable, High-Performance Motion Estimation Application for a Weakly-Programmable FPGA Architecture","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.14","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable, High-Performance Motion Estimation Application for a Weakly-Programmable FPGA Architecture","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770325","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5694213/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable, High-Performance Motion Estimation Application for a Weakly-Programmable FPGA Architecture","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054801S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5694214,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Verma","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Verma","id":"38004311100"},{"name":"Ajay K.

The system can be configured on programmable devices such as FPGAs as a set of instances of a predefined core called REMA. Each core addresses one of the subtasks into which the regular expression matching problem can be partitioned. These cores work in parallel on the same string analyzing different possible matchings. Since the system can exploit dynamic partial reconfigurations, it can adapt the number of cores configured on the device at run-time, according to the complexity of the regular expression, which is proportional to the number of different ways in which the reference string can be mapped on pattern. Making it possible to parallelize the matching process with a multiple core architecture drastically improves temporal efficiency (up to one order of magnitude with respect to software solutions and up to a speedup factor of 25 with respect to hardware solutions). Most important, the run-time reconfigurability feature allows to implement a just in time logic usage strategy, thus reducing the mean amount of resources required.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable System Based on a Parallel and Pipelined Solution for Regular Expression Matching","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.20","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694219.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable System Based on a Parallel and Pipelined Solution for Regular Expression Matching","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694219/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770333","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable System Based on a Parallel and Pipelined Solution for Regular Expression Matching","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062637S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5694220,"authors":[{"name":"Thilan Ganegedara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Thilan","lastName":"Ganegedara","id":"37712753600"},{"name":"Yi-Hua E.

Paralleling the technique used by software compilers, we divide our framework into two parts: a frontend that parses each PCRE-formatted regular expression (regex) into a modular non-deterministic finite automaton (RE-NFA), followed by a backend that generates the REM circuit design for a multi-pipeline architecture. With such organization, various pattern and circuit level optimizations can be applied to the frontend and backend, respectively. The multi-pipeline architecture utilizes both logic slices and on-chip BRAM for optimized character matching; in addition, it can be configured at compile-time to produce concurrent matching outputs from multiple RE-NFAs. Our framework prototype handles up to 64k \"regular\" regexes with arbitrary complexity and number of states, limited only by the hardware resources of the target device. Running on a commodity 2.3 GHz PC (AMD Opteron 1356), it takes less than a minute for the framework to convert ~1800 regexes used by the Snort IDS into RTL-level designs with optimized logic and memory usage. Such an automation framework could be invaluable to REM systems to update regex definitions with minimal human intervention.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.21","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694220.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automation Framework for Large-Scale Regular Expression Matching on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694220/","displayDocTitle":"Automation Framework for Large-Scale Regular Expression Matching on FPGA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770335","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694220/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automation Framework for Large-Scale Regular Expression Matching on FPGA","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058128S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5694221,"authors":[{"name":"Weirong Jiang","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Weirong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37288835900"},{"name":"Maya Gokhale","affiliation":["Center of Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Maya","lastName":"Gokhale","id":"37265510600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694221","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":987},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Accuracy","Field programmable gate arrays","Multimedia communication","Clocks","Testing","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Internet","pattern clustering","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia traffic","FPGA","real-time classification","Internet traffic","network management","surveillance","deep packet inspection","machine learning","k-nearest neighbors","locality sensitive hashing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["traffic classification","multimedia application","k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)","locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)"]}],"abstract":"Real-time classification of Internet traffic according to application types is vital for network management and surveillance. Identifying emerging applications based on well-known port numbers is no longer reliable. While deep packet inspection (DPI) solutions can be accurate, they require constant updates of signatures and become infeasible for encrypted payload especially in multimedia applications (e.g. Skype). Statistical approaches based on machine learning have thus been considered more promising and robust to encryption, privacy, protocol obfuscation, etc. However, the computation complexity of traffic classification using those statistical solutions is high, which prevents them being deployed in systems that need to manage Internet traffic in real time. This paper proposes a FPGA-based parallel architecture to accelerate the statistical identification of multimedia applications while maintaining high classification accuracy. Specifically, we base our design on the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm which has been shown to be one of the most accurate machine learning algorithms for Internet traffic classification. To enable high-rate data streaming for real-time classification, we adopt the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for approximate k-NN. The LSH scheme is carefully designed to achieve high accuracy while being efficient for implementation on FPGA. Processing components in the architecture are optimized to realize high throughput. Extensive experiments and FPGA implementation results show that our design can achieve high accuracy above 99% for classifying three main categories of multimedia applications from Internet traffic while sustaining 80 Gbps throughput for minimum size (40 bytes) packets.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.22","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694221.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Classification of Multimedia Traffic Using FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694221/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Classification of Multimedia Traffic Using FPGA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770336","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694221/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Classification of Multimedia Traffic Using FPGA","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088486S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5694223,"authors":[{"name":"Andres Otero","affiliation":["Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Otero","id":"37585852100"},{"name":"Eduardo de la Torre","affiliation":["Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"de la Torre","id":"37355566400"},{"name":"Teresa Riesgo","affiliation":["Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Riesgo","id":"37283653200"},{"name":"Yana E.

Flexibility can be related with the reusability of the cores in charge of the execution of computation-intensive tasks, but also with the run-time adaptation of these cores to the execution of time-variable tasks, or to changing system conditions. Among the run-time flexibility requirements of hardware IPs, functional scalability has been identified as an interesting feature. The proposal in this paper is to take advantage of the regularity and the high-processing capability of systolic arrays, to develop run-time functional scalable cores, making use of spatial scalability, by means of replicating and relocating basic processing elements of the array. The relocation process is performed using the dynamic-reconfiguration possibilities offered by commercial FPGAs. In this paper, an architectural template is proposed to develop systolic scalable coprocessors following this approach, together with its corresponding software drivers that may be executed within an embedded processor. In addition, a design flow is proposed to adapt the architectural template to different problems, together with some examples of scalable cores created following this design. This solution provides better results, regarding the reconfiguration time and the memory necessity overhead, compared with other dynamically scalable solutions.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.24","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694223.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Run-Time Scalable Systolic Coprocessors for Flexible Multimedia SoPCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694223/","displayDocTitle":"Run-Time Scalable Systolic Coprocessors for Flexible Multimedia SoPCs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770338","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694223/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Run-Time Scalable Systolic Coprocessors for Flexible Multimedia SoPCs","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071775S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5694224,"authors":[{"name":"David B.

These include the asynchronous pipelines common to \"map\" tasks, a partially synchronous tree common to \"reduce\" tasks and a fully synchronous, fully connected mesh. We show that the GPU is more productive than the FPGA architecture for most of the benchmarks and conclude that FPGA-based HPCS is being marginalised by GPUs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770345","htmlLink":"/document/5694231/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GPU Versus FPGA for High Productivity Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU Versus FPGA for High Productivity Computing","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068159S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694232,"authors":[{"name":"Doris Chen","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Doris","lastName":"Chen","id":"37066176200"},{"name":"Deshanand Singh","affiliation":["Altera Toronto Technology Center, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Deshanand","lastName":"Singh","id":"37289147000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694232","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Graphics processing unit","Kernel","Instruction sets","Logic gates","Delay","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA technology","graphics processing unit","GPU","graph based algorithm"]}],"abstract":"GPUs are becoming an increasingly attractive option for obtaining performance speedups for data-parallel applications. FPGA technology mapping is an algorithm that is heavily data parallel; however, it has many features that make it unattractive to implement on a GPU.

In CLAHE, the enhancement is controlled to avoid excess amplification of the noises in the local regions. CLAHE computes several histograms of intensity values, each corresponding to a distinct region of the image, distributes the histograms to avoid the excess amplification, and remaps the intensity values using the distributed histograms. In this paper, we propose an approach for real-time computation of CLAHE using an FPGA. In our system, (1) a histogram is generated for each pixel in a image, and the intensity of only the pixel is remapped using the histogram to generate smooth images, and (2) each histogram is speculatively distributed without iterations by feeding back the distribution result of its previous pixel. With this approach, we can achieve real-time processing of HD images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770351","htmlLink":"/document/5694237/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Processing of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization on FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Processing of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization on FPGA","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038672S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694245,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Although such a system may seem rather far fetched, we believe that basic semiconductor technology, computer architecture and software systems have advanced to the point that the time is ripe to realize such a system. In this paper we present an implementation of an FPGA-based Self-Aware Adaptive computing system which blends techniques developed in different research fields, i.e, monitoring, decision making, and self-adaptation. The result is a system built on top of a set of enabling technology that proves the effectiveness of using Self-Aware Adaptive computing systems. We used the Application Heartbeats to assess performance goals and to inspect application progress and the Implementation Switch Service to switch between different implementations of the same algorithm (both in software and in hardware) at runtime. Preliminary results show the effectiveness and the usability of the proposed approach.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694245.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Aware Adaptation in FPGA-based Systems","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.43","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Self-Aware Adaptation in FPGA-based Systems","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770359","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5694245/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Aware Adaptation in FPGA-based Systems","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05483S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694250,"authors":[{"name":"Otto Esko","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Otto","lastName":"Esko","id":"37992780300"},{"name":"Pekka J\u00e4\u00e4skelainen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"J\u00e4\u00e4skelainen","id":"37298508200"},{"name":"Pablo Huerta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, M\u00f3stoles, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Huerta","id":"37572359500"},{"name":"Carlos S. de La Lama","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, M\u00f3stoles, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos S.","lastName":"de La Lama","id":"37593860100"},{"name":"Jarmo Takala","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Takala","id":"37275700700"},{"name":"Jose Ignacio Martinez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland","Department of Computer Architecture, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, M\u00f3stoles, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Ignacio","lastName":"Martinez","id":"37577576600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694250","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"abstract":"A popular way to exploit high level programming languages in FPGA designs is to use a soft-core with accompanying software development tools. However, a common shortcoming with the current soft-core offerings is their limited software execution capability: the required performance for the implementation can be often reached only with instruction set extensions. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an application-specific processor design toolset that uses a multi-issue exposed data path processor architecture template. The main benefit of the architecture is scalability with respect to instruction-level parallelism (ILP). The design flow allows the designer to freely customize the data path resources in the core to exploit the ILP available in computation intensive kernels. The design toolset includes a retargetable C compiler and an architecture simulator, making design space exploration feasible. The experiments show that a relatively small soft-core tailored with the toolset provides significant speedups on software execution without using any instruction set extensions. The best measured speedup in comparison to the major commercial soft-cores was fourfold in applications from the CHStone benchmark suite, while the amount of consumed FPGA resources remained moderate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Hardware","VLIW","Radio frequency","Generators","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC:

The Travelling Salesman Problem is elected as a case study for this work since it is a representative problem in the field of graph theory. A GA implementation in a Virtex 4 FPGA device is shown for solving a TSP with 1002 cities at a frequency of 96MHz. The proposed architecture is based in a pipeline capable of processing 1 city per clock cycle.

The work proposes design techniques in three primary areas, viz., power yield enhancement, timing yield enhancement and IR-drop reduction. An architecture and CAD enhancement technique is proposed for improving the timing yield of FPGAs under process variations. Two different techniques are proposed for improving the power yield of FPGAs under process variations. The first technique reduces spatial correlation among leaking blocks to reduce leakage variability, whereas the second technique sizes the transistors of the buffers in the interconnects to reduce leakage variability. For IR-drop reduction, two different CAD techniques are proposed. The first design methodology is an IR-drop aware place and route technique which reduces local switching activities in a region to reduce IR-drops. The second approach is an IR-drop aware clustering methodology. This methodology reduces the clustering of high switching activity nets in a logic cluster to improve the supply voltage profile.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust FPGA Design under Variations","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.60","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694259.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust FPGA Design under Variations","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694259/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770372","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust FPGA Design under Variations","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071228S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5694266,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Koga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Koga","id":"38003489700"},{"name":"Masahiro Iida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Iida","id":"37290518600"},{"name":"Motoki Amagasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoki","lastName":"Amagasaki","id":"37295778700"},{"name":"Yoshinobu Ichida","affiliation":["KTC LSI Development Headquarters, ROHM Company Limited, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshinobu","lastName":"Ichida","id":"38007978200"},{"name":"Mitsuro Saji","affiliation":["KTC LSI Development Headquarters, ROHM Company Limited, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuro","lastName":"Saji","id":"38012980900"},{"name":"Jun Iida","affiliation":["LSI Development Headquarters, ROHM Company Limited, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Iida","id":"37995756600"},{"name":"Toshinori Sueyoshi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshinori","lastName":"Sueyoshi","id":"37302132800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694266","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694266","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory","Ferroelectric films","Logic gates","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","logic devices","reconfigurable architectures","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power gatable reconfigurable logic chip","FeRAM cell","RLD","FPGA","field programmable gate array","SoC","embedded system","power gating","SRAM","ferroelectric random access memory","nonvolatile flipflop","island style routing architecture","standby power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RLD","FeRAM","Power-Gating","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"An advantage of a RLD (Reconfigurable logic device) such as an FPGA (Field programmable gate array) is that it can be customized after being manufactured. However, there is a problem related to standby power when using it in SoC used in embedded systems. Power gating, which is one of the power reduction techniques, is difficult to use in SRAM-based RLDs because of the high overhead - data hibernation and reconfiguration time - and SRAM being volatile. In this paper, we describe a chip that we developed - are configurable logic chip based on FeRAM (Ferroelectric random access memory) technology. The chip employs island-style routing architecture and uses a variable grain logic cell as a logic block. A NV-FF (Non-Volatile FlipFlop), which contains FeRAM, aFF, and power-gating control circuits, is used as configuration memory. The NV-FF can transmit data between FeRAM and FF automatically when power to the chip is turned off/on. Thus, chip-level power gating is possible. The hibernate/restore time is less than 1 ms. The chip has 18 x 18 logic blocks and an area of 54.76 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.67","startPage":"298","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694266.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.67","endPage":"303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First Prototype of a Genuine Power-Gatable Reconfigurable Logic Chip with FeRAM Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"First Prototype of a Genuine Power-Gatable Reconfigurable Logic Chip with FeRAM Cells","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694266/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11770376","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First Prototype of a Genuine Power-Gatable Reconfigurable Logic Chip with FeRAM Cells","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122386S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5694268,"authors":[{"name":"Dam Sunwoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Dam","lastName":"Sunwoo","id":"37644255500"},{"name":"Gene Y.

As a design progresses and more detailed information becomes available, more accurate power estimations become possible but at the cost of significantly slower simulation speeds. Power simulation that is both sufficiently-accurate and fast would have a positive impact on architecture and design. In this paper, we propose PrEsto, a power modeling methodology that improves the speed and accuracy of power estimation through FPGA-acceleration. PrEsto automatically generates FPGA-based power estimators consisting of linear models that are designed to be integrated into fast, accurate FPGA-based performance simulators of microprocessors. Our prototype implementation predicts the cycle-by-cycle power dissipation of the LEON3 core and the ARM Cortex-A8 core to within 6% of a commercial gate-level power estimation tool, while running several orders of magnitude faster. The combination of simulation speed and accuracy is not only useful to architects and designers, it is fast enough to be useful for power-sensitive operating system and application developers.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.69","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694268.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PrEsto: An FPGA-accelerated Power Estimation Methodology for Complex Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694268/","displayDocTitle":"PrEsto: An FPGA-accelerated Power Estimation Methodology for Complex Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770381","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694268/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PrEsto: An FPGA-accelerated Power Estimation Methodology for Complex Systems","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060174S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5694269,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas B.

This capability is highly valuable as it enables the utilization of these fast special-purpose structures for general-purpose logic. The described approach is both automatic and generally applicable to all carry-chain architectures designed for binary addition. It, thus, lifts severe constraints left by previous works. It helps to reduce the pressure on the general-purpose routing resources and accelerates critical logic paths. The proposed mapping is further shown to enhance the logic capability of a logic block containing a k-input lookup table (k-LUT) to implement many (k+1)-input functions on common FPGA architectures. This, in particular, also applies to all logic functions with a non-inverting path as introduced by Anderson and Wang. This makes their envisioned gains in logic density achievable even on current devices without requiring their architectural extension. The benefits of the carry-chain mapping are experimentally evaluated on the basis of combinational MCNC benchmarks. It is shown how carry chains can be recovered within a functional standard mapping and that a device mapping aware of carry chains achieves a reduction of the combinational delay of about a 20 percent.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694269.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.70","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing FPGA Device Capabilities by the Automatic Logic Mapping to Additive Carry Chains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing FPGA Device Capabilities by the Automatic Logic Mapping to Additive Carry Chains","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694269/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5694269/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770382","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing FPGA Device Capabilities by the Automatic Logic Mapping to Additive Carry Chains","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071114S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694270,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In nanometer-scale CMOS, Excessive quiescent power dissipation can lead to excessive heat generation and reliability issues. To address energy efficiency and idle power consumption, we present a novel Complementary Nano-Electro-Mechanical (CNEM) switch that we manufactured which operates with virtually zero leakage current, has 1 to 2 Volts operation voltage, >; 1 GHZ fundamental resonant frequency, and nanometer-scale footprint. These CNEM switches can be \u201cdropped\u201d in and hybridized with CMOS at the metallization or device levels to manage leakage current and power. In this paper, we present a hybrid CMOS/CNEMS FPGA. The hybrid FPGA is based on using the CNEM switching device as a replacement of CMOS devices in the switch and connection block components found in FPGA architectures. We analyzed the impact of the CNEM substitution on power and delay using VPR and the MCNC benchmark circuits. We present experimental results showing an average 98%, 85%, 71%, and 99.99% reduction in critical path delay, routing energy, total energy, leakage power when comparisons are made between FPGA design using pure CMOS (180nm technology and hybrid CNEMS and CMOS (180nm) technology.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.79","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694279.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-low-Power Ultra-fast Hybrid CNEMS-CMOS FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11764235","htmlLink":"/document/5694279/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-low-Power Ultra-fast Hybrid CNEMS-CMOS FPGA","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078287S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5694280,"authors":[{"name":"Sumanta Chaudhuri","affiliation":["CNRS, Orsay, France","IEF, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Sumanta","lastName":"Chaudhuri","id":"37401081200"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["IEF, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France","CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37536930400"},{"name":"Jacques-Oliver Klein","affiliation":["IEF, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France","CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Jacques-Oliver","lastName":"Klein","id":"37276514100"},{"name":"Claude Chappert","affiliation":["IEF, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France","CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Chappert","id":"37315626200"},{"name":"Pascale Mazoyer","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Pascale","lastName":"Mazoyer","id":"37264915800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694280","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":428},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Field programmable gate arrays","Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","Routing","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","CMOS memory circuits","field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","MRAM devices","random-access storage","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous lookup table","nonvolatile magnetic RAM","fine grain runtime reconfiguration","multicontext configuration","CMOS MRAM circuits","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MRAM","asynchronous","FPGA","LUT","non-volatile","low power and high speed"]}],"abstract":"In this article, we present the architecture design of high-performance Asynchronous Look Up Table (LUT) embedded with a non-volatile Magnetic RAM (MRAM) as the configuration memory, called MALUT.

The results of the comparison depend on the inherent properties of competing algorithms, as well as on selected hardware architectures, implementation techniques, FPGA families, languages and tools. In this paper, we introduce an open-source environment, called ATHENa for fair, comprehensive, automated, and collaborative hardware benchmarking of algorithms belonging to the same class. As our first goal, we select the benchmarking of algorithms belonging to the area of cryptography. Algorithms from this area have been shown to achieve significant speed-ups and security gains compared to software when implemented in FPGAs. The capabilities of our environment are demonstrated using three examples: two different hardware architectures of the current cryptographic hash function standard, SHA-256, and one architecture of a candidate for the new standard, Fugue. All source codes, testbenches, and configuration files necessary to repeat experiments described in this paper are made available through the project web site.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.86","startPage":"414","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694286.pdf","endPage":"421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.86","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694286/","displayDocTitle":"ATHENa - Automated Tool for Hardware EvaluatioN: Toward Fair and Comprehensive Benchmarking of Cryptographic Hardware Using FPGAs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5694286/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11770398","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATHENa - Automated Tool for Hardware EvaluatioN: Toward Fair and Comprehensive Benchmarking of Cryptographic Hardware Using FPGAs","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064561S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694287,"authors":[{"name":"Florent de Dinechin","affiliation":["LIP, projet Ar\u00e9naire, ENS de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"de Dinechin","id":"37347508700"},{"name":"Hong Diep Nguyen","affiliation":["LIP, projet Ar\u00e9naire, ENS de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Hong Diep","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37897369400"},{"name":"Bogdan Pasca","affiliation":["LIP, projet Ar\u00e9naire, ENS de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Pasca","id":"37545456300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694287","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":765},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined FPGA Adders","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694287.pdf","startPage":"422","endPage":"427","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.87","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Field programmable gate arrays","Pipeline processing","Registers","Estimation","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","field programmable gate arrays","pipeline arithmetic","precision engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadprecision floating point integer","elliptic curve cryptography","pipelined large precision FPGA adder architectures","pipelined ripple carry adder","carry select adder","resource estimation models","integer addition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["addition","pipeline","low-latency","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694287","abstract":"Integer addition is a universal building block, and applications such as quad-precision floating-point or elliptic curve cryptography now demand precisions well beyond 64 bits.

Although FPGAs are more and more used, they are however still considered as power inefficient compared to standard-cell or full-custom technologies. New dedicated design approaches are thus needed to reduce this gap. In this paper, we address low-power design on FPGA through a dedicated High-Level Synthesis (HLS) flow. The proposed approach allows to slow down the clock frequency in parts of the design, decrease the complexity of the clock-network, reduce the number of long wires and perform clock-gating. The design flow has been fully implemented and allows to automatically synthesize hierarchical and synchronous multiple-clock domain architectures. The power consumption of the architectures we generate has been investigated and compared with state-of-the-art synthesis approaches.

Montgomery's modular multiplication algorithm is normally used since no trial division is necessary and the critical path is reduced by using carry-save addition (CSA). In this paper, the Montgomery multiplication is greatly optimized and architectures are proposed to perform the Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) first and the Most-Significant-Bit (MSB) first algorithms. The architecture here presented has the following distinctive characteristics: 1) Use of digit-serial approach for Montgomery multiplication. 2) Conversion of the CSA representation of intermediate multiplication using carry-skip addition which reduces the critical path with a small area-speed penalty. 3) Precompute quotient value in Montgomery iteration in order to speed up operation frequency. In this work, implementation results in Xilinx Virtex 5 and Virtex 2 are reported. Experimental results show that the proposed modular exponentiation and modular multiplication design obtains the best delay performance compared with previous published works and outperforms them in terms of area-time complexity.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694300.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.99","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient FPGA Modular Multiplication and Exponentiation Architectures Using Digit Serial Computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient FPGA Modular Multiplication and Exponentiation Architectures Using Digit Serial Computation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694300/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5694300/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770305","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient FPGA Modular Multiplication and Exponentiation Architectures Using Digit Serial Computation","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092901S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5694302,"authors":[{"name":"Maki Yasuda","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Maki","lastName":"Yasuda","id":"38000242000"},{"name":"Minoru Watanabe","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37277634600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694302","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Holographic optical components","Optical imaging","Holography","Photodiodes","Optical sensors","High speed optical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","real-time systems","reconfigurable architectures","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable vision-chip architecture","autonomous vehicles","robots","analog-type vision chips","digital vision chips","real-time image recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field Programmable Gate Arrays","Dynamically reconfigurable devices","Vision chips"]}],"abstract":"Recently, for autonomous vehicles and robots, demand has been increasing for high-speed image recognition that is superior to that of the human eye.

This paper addresses the problem of matching logic functions of ~ 9 to 12 inputs to K-LUT structures. Our method is based on the off-line generation of libraries of LUT structures. During resynthesis, matching is accomplished efficiently using NPN encoding and hash table look-ups. Generating an effective library of LUT structures may seem prohibitive due to the overwhelming number of logic functions which must be considered and represented in the library.

This algorithm tries to create a good quality placement from a flattened design that no longer contains any high-level information related to the original design hierarchy. Unfortunately, placement is an NP-hard problem and as the size and complexity of designs implemented on FPGAs increases, SA does not scale well to find good solutions in a timely fashion. As modern FPGAs can be used to implement Systems- and Networks-on-Chip, designers are required to spend an increasing amount of time waiting for place and route tools to complete that is not being matched by an increase in the power of computing work stations. In this paper, we investigate if system-level information can be reconstructed from a flattened netlist and evaluate how that information is realized in terms of its locality in the final placement. If there is a strong relationship between good quality placements and system-level information, then it may be possible to divide a large design into smaller components and improve the time needed to create a good quality placement. Our preliminary results suggest that the locality property of the information embedded in the system-level HDL structure (i.e. \u201cmodule\u201d, \u201calways\u201d, and \u201cif\u201d statements) is greatly affected by both the designer and the design itself. A reconstructive algorithm, called affinity propagation, is also considered as a possible method of generating a meaningful coarse grain picture of the design.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694308.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding System-Level Information and Analyzing Its Correlation to FPGA Placement","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Finding System-Level Information and Analyzing Its Correlation to FPGA Placement","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770312","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5694308/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding System-Level Information and Analyzing Its Correlation to FPGA Placement","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081131S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5694309,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Ferreira","affiliation":["Departamento de Informatica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa UFV, Vicosa, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37306756300"},{"name":"Julio C.

These methods are computationally very intensive. More specifically, this work focuses on an efficient approach to compute the attractor cycles in gene regulatory networks, which are modeled by Boolean graphs. This work proposes to explore the inherent parallelism of this approach by using a FPGA based implementation. In addition, we also propose a runtime framework to dynamically insert/delete edges at low cost by using a multistage interconnection network (MIN). We also show that MIN could be efficiently mapped on FPGAs by taking advantages of embedded memory modules. The MIN implementation is close to theoretical complexity O(n lg n). Moreover, we propose a heterogeneous node set, where few nodes are strongly connected and most nodes are poorly connected, which allow us to handle efficiently scale free topologies. Furthermore, our approach is synthesized once onto a FPGA and several simulations are performed, without the need of re-synthesis. Experimental results have shown acceleration gains up to three orders of magnitude compared to sequential approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-accelerated Attractor Computation of Scale Free Gene Regulatory Networks","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.108","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694309.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-accelerated Attractor Computation of Scale Free Gene Regulatory Networks","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5694309/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770313","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-accelerated Attractor Computation of Scale Free Gene Regulatory Networks","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084671S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5694311,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Kirsch","affiliation":["CERN, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Kirsch","id":"37995214100"},{"name":"Felix Rettig","affiliation":["Kirchhoff Institute of Physics, University of Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Rettig","id":"37697784000"},{"name":"Dirk Hutter","affiliation":["Kirchhoff Institute of Physics, University of Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Hutter","id":"38004616200"},{"name":"Jan de Cuveland","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies, Frankfurt University, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"de Cuveland","id":"38625318900"},{"name":"Venelin Angelov","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies, Frankfurt University, Germany"],"firstName":"Venelin","lastName":"Angelov","id":"37562901700"},{"name":"Volker Lindenstruth","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies, Frankfurt University, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Lindenstruth","id":"37267703600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694311","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based High-Speed, Low-Latency Processing System for High-Energy Physics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694311","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Detectors","Data acquisition","Hardware","Linux","Monitoring","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","high energy physics instrumentation computing","nuclear engineering computing","optical links","particle detectors","trigger circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","ALICE transition radiation detector","global tracking unit","Large Hadron Collider","trigger processor","embedded PowerPC core","hardware software codesign","optical link","high-energy physics"]}],"abstract":"The Global Tracking Unit of the ALICE Transition Radiation Detector is a high-speed, low-latency trigger processor installed at the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.

However, little focus is normally given to the FPGA memory organizations to efficiently use the data fetched into the FPGA. This work presents a Front End Memory (FEM) layout based on BRAMs and Distributed RAM for FPGA-based accelerators. The presented memory layout serves as a template for various data organizations which is in fact a step towards the standardization of a methodology for FPGA based memory management inside an accelerator. We present example application kernels implemented as specializations of the template memory layout. Further, the presented layout can be used for Spatially Mapped-Shared Memory multi-kernel applications targeting FPGAs. This fact is evaluated by mapping two applications, an Acoustic Wave Equation code and an N-Body method, to three multi-kernel execution models on a Virtex-4 L\u00d7200 device. The results show that the shared memory model for Acoustic Wave Equation code outperforms the local and runtime reconfigured models by 1.3-1.5\u00d7, respectively. For the N-Body method the shared model is slightly more efficient with a small number of bodies, but for larger systems the runtime reconfigured model shows a 3\u00d7 speedup over the other two models.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.111","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694312.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"FEM: A Step Towards a Common Memory Layout for FPGA Based Accelerators","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770316","htmlLink":"/document/5694312/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM: A Step Towards a Common Memory Layout for FPGA Based Accelerators","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4179a568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085972S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5690273","isNumber":"5694025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5690273","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5694025","articleId":"5694312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5694313,"authors":[{"name":"Florent de Dinechin","affiliation":["Ar\u00e9naire, LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL),ENS-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"de Dinechin","id":"37347508700"},{"name":"Mioara Joldes","affiliation":["Ar\u00e9naire, LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL),ENS-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Mioara","lastName":"Joldes","id":"37545457900"},{"name":"Bogdan Pasca","affiliation":["Ar\u00e9naire, LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL),ENS-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Pasca","id":"37545456300"},{"name":"Guillaume Revy","affiliation":["Ar\u00e9naire, LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL),ENS-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Revy","id":"37392294300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7843-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7842-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4179-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5694313","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplicative Square Root Algorithms for FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5690273/5694025/05694313.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"577","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2010.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694025","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2010.112","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Approximation methods","Hardware","Table lookup","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","polynomial approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplicative square root algorithms","FPGA","embedded multipliers","RAM blocks","radix digit recurrences","polynomial approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","square root","floating-point"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694313","abstract":"Most current square root implementations for FPGAs use a digit recurrence algorithm which is well suited to their LUT structure.

The cost of these solutions is evaluated and compared, and a complete implementation of a polynomial approach is presented within the open-source FloPoCo framework.

First of all, the neural network model for predicting the evolution of shoal in a river is established, through training the neural network to determine the number of hidden layer's neural, thus, a more ration neural network structure is detemaned; In the second step, by using genetic algorithm a fittest initial weight value is selectled from the solution group of initial weight values to avoid the blindness in the selection of initial weight value; if the traditional BP algorithm is used in the training, there are still some hidden dangers. Finally, conjugate gradient algorithm is used to improve performance of network. Simulation results show that the method is feasible and effective.","doi":"10.1109/ICIII.2010.144","startPage":"578","endPage":"582","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5691020/5694334/05694473.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIII.2010.144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5694334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Genetic Neural Network for Predicting the Evolution of Shoal in River","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Rivers","Training","Predictive models","Genetics","Convergence","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","hydrological techniques","neural nets","rivers","water conservation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["river shoal evolution","water conservancy projects","waterways planning","neural network model","initial weight value","conjugate gradient algorithm","genetic algorithm","genetic neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","genetic algorithm","shoal evolution","conjugate gradient algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5694473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Application of Genetic Neural Network for Predicting the Evolution of Shoal in River","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5694473/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11764247","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Genetic Neural Network for Predicting the Evolution of Shoal in River","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"4279a578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064084S","chronDate":"26-28 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5691020","isNumber":"5694334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5691020","xplore-issue":"5694334","articleId":"5694473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5694930,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Gang","affiliation":["School of Information Management and Engineering, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China","School of Economic and Management, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Gang","id":"37407792600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8829-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1472"}],"articleNumber":"5694930","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":944},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information management","Industrial engineering","Innovation management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","computer centres","information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data center","management plan","cloud computing","IT service model","large-scale computing","virtualization","on-demand computing","dynamic deployment","flexible scalability","SaaS","software as service","PaaS","platform as a service","IaaS","infrastructure as a service","IT infrastructure","IT foundation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing Environment","Data Center","Management Plan","Construction Safety"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing environment is a new IT service model to support large-scale computing resources of virtualization, on-demand computing, dynamic deployment and flexible scalability.

Since the SIC detection, which can be regarded as a backward substitution, is inevitable, we develop a computationally efficient preprocessing algorithm that relies on the backward substitution. We then propose a low-cost hardware architecture with a commonly shared backward-substitution module to work at both the preprocessing and detection stages. The very-large-scale-integration implementation results of our architecture for the four-by-four MIMO system using the 0.18-\u03bcm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology reveal that our architecture requires the fewest 79-K gates, provides the high throughput rate of 416 Mb/s, and works with the smallest preprocessing latency of 64 clock cycles.

A good ensemble can also mean one with good stopping set, trapping set, or pseudocodeword properties. In this paper, ensemble codeword weight enumerators for finite-length LDPC and G-LDPC codes based on protographs were derived, and then the asymptotic case was considered. The asymptotic results allow us to determine whether or not the typical relative minimum distance in the ensemble grows linearly with codeword length. Then, the codeword weight enumerator technique is adapted to yield ensemble stopping set, trapping set, and pseudocodeword enumerators for protograph LDPC and G-LDPC codes. In this case, the asymptotic results allow us to determine whether or not the typical relative smallest stopping set size, trapping set size, and pseudoweight grows linearly with codeword length.

We extend this analysis to any MBIOS channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","volume":"57","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11769519","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695116/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"LP Decoding of Regular LDPC Codes in Memoryless Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LP Decoding of Regular LDPC Codes in Memoryless Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-halabi-2094830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114564S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5695090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5695090","articleId":"5695116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5695118,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Li","affiliation":["WINLAB, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Li","id":"37538210200"},{"name":"Emina Soljanin","affiliation":["Mathematics of Networking and Communication Department, Enabling Computing Technologies, Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Emina","lastName":"Soljanin","id":"37269587200"},{"name":"Predrag Spasojevic","affiliation":["WINLAB, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Predrag","lastName":"Spasojevic","id":"38072889000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5695118","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":667},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Decoding","Throughput","Peer to peer computing","Equations","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear network coding","network coded content distribution","random generation scheduling","decoding","coupon collector problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupon collector's problem","Network coding","rateless codes"]}],"abstract":"To reduce computational complexity and delay in randomized network coded content distribution, and for some other practical reasons, coding is not performed simultaneously over all content blocks, but over much smaller, possibly overlapping subsets of these blocks, known as generations. A penalty of this strategy is throughput reduction. To analyze the throughput loss, we model coding over generations with random generation scheduling as a coupon collector's brotherhood problem. This model enables us to derive the expected number of coded packets needed for successful decoding of the entire content as well as the probability of decoding failure (the latter only when generations do not overlap) and further, to quantify the tradeoff between computational complexity and throughput. Interestingly, with a moderate increase in the generation size, throughput quickly approaches link capacity. Overlaps between generations can further improve throughput substantially for relatively small generation sizes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2095111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5695090/05695118.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2095111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695090","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of the Generation Size and Overlap on Throughput and Complexity in Randomized Linear Network Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of the Generation Size and Overlap on Throughput and Complexity in Randomized Linear Network Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695118/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769521","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of the Generation Size and Overlap on Throughput and Complexity in Randomized Linear Network Coding","sourcePdf":"tit-li-2095111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027288S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","isNumber":"5695090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"56","articleId":"5695118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5695120,"authors":[{"name":"Wittawat Kositwattanarerk","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Wittawat Kositwattanarerk received the B.A. degrees in mathematics and economics from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, in 2006.

In this context, state evolution plays the role that density evolution has for sparse graphs. The proof technique is fundamentally different from the standard approach to density evolution, in that it copes with a large number of short cycles in the underlying factor graph.

The network implements linear network coding to deliver n packets from source to each receiver, and the adversary can eavesdrop on \u03bc arbitrarily chosen links. The objective is to provide reliable communication to all receivers, while guaranteeing that the source information remains information-theoretically secure from the adversary. A coding scheme is proposed that can achieve the maximum possible rate of n - \u03bc packets. The scheme, which is based on rank-metric codes, has the distinctive property of being universal: it can be applied on top of any communication network without requiring knowledge of or any modifications on the underlying linear network code. The only requirement of the scheme is that the packet length be at least n, which is shown to be strictly necessary for universal communication at the maximum rate. A further scenario is considered where the adversary is allowed not only to eavesdrop but also to inject up to t erroneous packets into the network, and the network may suffer from a rank deficiency of at most \u03c1. In this case, the proposed scheme can be extended to achieve the rate of n - \u03c1 - 2t - \u03bc packets.

In this paper, we review the turbo equalization approach to coded data transmission over ISI channels, with an emphasis on the basic ideas, some of the practical details, and many of the research directions that have arisen from this offshoot, introduced by Douillard, of the original turbo decoding algorithm. The subsequent relaxation of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) equalization algorithm to include linear and other simpler receivers sparked a decade and a half of research into iterative algorithms, spanning research problems ranging from trellis coded modulation to underwater acoustic communications.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2096033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2096033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5695090/05695128.pdf","startPage":"920","endPage":"952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo Equalization: An Overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Turbo Equalization: An Overview","volume":"57","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695128/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769531","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695128/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo Equalization: An Overview","sourcePdf":"tit-singer-2096033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.268609S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5695090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"5695090","articleId":"5695128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5695129,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Langberg","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, Open University of Israel, Raanana, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Michael Langberg (M'05) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics and computer science from Tel-Aviv University in 1996, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","He is a Senior Lecturer with the Computer Science Department, Open University of Israel.

It has been shown [Lehman and Lehman, SODA 2005] that determining the \u201cscalar linear\u201d capacity of a general network coding instance is NP-hard. In this paper we address the notion of approximation in the context of both linear and nonlinear network coding. Loosely speaking, we show that given an instance of the general network coding problem of capacity \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</i>\n , constructing a code of rate \u03b1\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</i>\n for any universal (i.e., independent of the size of the instance) constant \u03b1 \u2264 1 is \u201chard\u201d. Specifically, finding such network codes would solve a long standing open problem in the field of graph coloring. Our results refer to scalar linear, vector linear, and nonlinear encoding functions and are the first results that address the computational complexity of achieving the network coding capacity in both the vector linear and general network coding scenarios. In addition, we consider the problem of determining the (scalar) linear capacity of a planar network coding instance (i.e., an instance in which the underlying graph is planar). We show that even for planar networks this problem remains NP-hard.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695129/","volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5695129/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11769528","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Hardness of Approximating the Network Coding Capacity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Hardness of Approximating the Network Coding Capacity","sourcePdf":"tit-sprintson-2094910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098643S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5695090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5695090","articleId":"5695129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695130,"authors":[{"name":"Shrinivas Kudekar","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico Consortium, Los Alamos, NM, USA","\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Shrinivas Kudekar (S'06\u2013M'10) received the B.Tech. degree from the Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, in June 2009.","Currently, he is pursuing his postdoctoral research at the New Mexico Consortium and CNLS, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM."]},"firstName":"Shrinivas","lastName":"Kudekar","id":"37546699200"},{"name":"Thomas J.

Several variations on the basic theme have been proposed to date, all of which share the good performance characteristics of convolutional LDPC ensembles. We describe the fundamental mechanism that explains why \u201cconvolutional-like\u201d or \u201cspatially coupled\u201d codes perform so well. In essence, the spatial coupling of individual codes increases the belief-propagation (BP) threshold of the new ensemble to its maximum possible value, namely the maximum a posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. For this reason, we call this phenomenon \u201cthreshold saturation.\u201d This gives an entirely new way of approaching capacity. One significant advantage of this construction is that one can create capacity-approaching ensembles with an error correcting radius that is increasing in the blocklength. Although we prove the \u201cthreshold saturation\u201d only for a specific ensemble and for the binary erasure channel (BEC), empirically the phenomenon occurs for a wide class of ensembles and channels. More generally, we conjecture that for a large range of graphical systems a similar saturation of the \u201cdynamical\u201d threshold occurs once individual components are coupled sufficiently strongly. This might give rise to improved algorithms and new techniques for analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2095072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2095072","startPage":"803","endPage":"834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5695090/05695130.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold Saturation via Spatial Coupling: Why Convolutional LDPC Ensembles Perform So Well over the BEC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Threshold Saturation via Spatial Coupling: Why Convolutional LDPC Ensembles Perform So Well over the BEC","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11769533","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695130/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold Saturation via Spatial Coupling: Why Convolutional LDPC Ensembles Perform So Well over the BEC","sourcePdf":"tit-urbanke-2095072-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145816S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5695090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"397","xplore-issue":"5695090","articleId":"5695130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5695131,"authors":[{"name":"Tuvi Etzion","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Tuvi Etzion (M\u201989\u2013SM\u201999\u2013F\u201904) was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 1956.

First, we present a new description of general expanded codes defined over GF(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">qm</i>\n). The proposed explicit description of the expanded generator matrix and the expanded parity check matrix reserves the symbol-wise algebraic structure. We reveal that the dual of an expanded code is the symbol-wise dual code expanded by the dual basis. Second, we characterize expanded cyclic codes utilizing the proposed expanded generator matrix (a similar analysis may be carried out over the proposed expanded parity check matrix). We focus on exploring the properties of component words of a codeword as well as their reciprocal relations. We reveal that the existence of subspace subcodes is dictated by conjugate roots of its dual generator polynomial, but not by its nonconjugate roots. We further show that each generator (parity check) matrix can be divided into block-bidiagonal submatrices associated with conjugate roots of the dual generator (generator) polynomial. Third, we shed light on binary expanded Reed-Solomon codes, which are of particular mathematical and practical interest. We first show an explicit way of constructing superior subspace subcodes utilizing the product basis which exhibit a higher dimension than the counterpart subfield subcodes. We next demonstrate that the effective dimension of the expanded parity check (generator) matrix, which governs the complexity of maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding, can be noticeably reduced by employing block-bidiagonal structures of submatrices associated with conjugate roots of the generator (dual generator) polynomial. We finally conclude that the fixed-rate binary expanded Reed-Solomon codes are asymptotically \u201cbad,\u201d regardless of basis realization, in the sense that the ratio of minimum distance over code length diminishes with code length going to infinity. We assert \u201cbadness\u201d in three scenarios, namely, (1) (conventional) fixed starting spectral null for all rates; (2) centered spectral null for rates above \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n/\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n; and (3) dynamic spectral null for rates above \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sup>\n/\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n.

We show that DC can be interpreted as a message-passing algorithm on a \u201cnormal\u201d factor graph. The \u201cdifference-map\u201d dynamics of the DC algorithm enables it to avoid \u201ctraps\u201d which may be related to the \u201ctrapping sets\u201d or \u201cpseudo-codewords\u201d that plague BP decoders of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes in the error-floor regime. We investigate two decoders for LDPC codes based on these ideas. The first decoder is based directly on DC, while the second decoder borrows the important \u201cdifference-map\u201d concept from the DC algorithm and translates it into a BP-like decoder. We show that this \u201cdifference-map belief propagation\u201d (DMBP) decoder has dramatically improved error-floor performance compared to standard BP decoders, while maintaining a similar computational complexity. We present simulation results for LDPC codes comparing DC and DMBP decoders with other decoders based on sum-product BP, linear programming, and mixed-integer linear programming. We also describe the close relation of the DMBP decoder to reweighted min-sum algorithms, including those recently proposed by Ruozzi and Tatikonda.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2094815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2094815","startPage":"786","endPage":"802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5695090/05695135.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Divide and Concur and Difference-Map BP Decoders for LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Divide and Concur and Difference-Map BP Decoders for LDPC Codes","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11769538","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695135/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Divide and Concur and Difference-Map BP Decoders for LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-yedidia-2094815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090757S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5695090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5695090","articleId":"5695135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5695137,"authors":[{"name":"Rathinakumar Appuswamy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rathinakumar Appuswamy (S'05) received the B.Tech. degree from Anna University, Chennai, India, and the M.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, both in electrical engineering in 2004, and the M.A. degree in mathematics from the University of California, San Diego, in 2008.","He is currently a doctoral student at the University of California, San Diego, where he is a member of the Information and Coding Laboratory, as well as the Advanced Network Sciences Group.

The network coding problem for a single-receiver network is a special case of the network computing problem in which all of the source messages must be reproduced at the receiver. For network coding with a single receiver, routing is known to achieve the capacity by achieving the network min-cut upper bound. We extend the definition of min-cut to the network computing problem and show that the min-cut is still an upper bound on the maximum achievable rate and is tight for computing (using coding) any target function in multi-edge tree networks. It is also tight for computing linear target functions in any network. We also study the bound's tightness for different classes of target functions. In particular, we give a lower bound on the computing capacity in terms of the Steiner tree packing number and a different bound for symmetric functions. We also show that for certain networks and target functions, the computing capacity can be less than an arbitrarily small fraction of the min-cut bound.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5695090/05695137.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2095070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2095070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Coding for Computing: Cut-Set Bounds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Network coding","Encoding","Upper bound","Indexes","Steiner trees","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","network computing","directed acyclic network","routing","multi edge tree network","Sterner tree packing number","target function","symmetric function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","cut-set bound","function computation","information theory","network coding","throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Network Coding for Computing: Cut-Set Bounds","volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5695137/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769536","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Coding for Computing: Cut-Set Bounds","sourcePdf":"tit-zeger-2095070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184508S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5695090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5695090","articleId":"5695137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5695172,"authors":[{"name":"Hongcheng Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hongcheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38007613600"},{"name":"Liang Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289059600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9018-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4293-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5695172","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"abstract":"A distributed permutation flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) is an NP-hard problem recently put forward in shop scheduling sphere.

To fit into the discrete domain of a DPFSP, modifications to the original EM algorithm, including redefinition of distance and movement and of charge and force calculation, have been made, to improve the performance of the proposed algorithm, a VNS local search mechanism employing the concept of the critical factory has been devised. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the original EM algorithm.

The implementation results showed that our RSA module for 2048-bit RSA encryption/decryption runs in 277.26ms. Quite surprisingly, the multiplier in DSP48E1 used to compute Montgomery multiplication works in more than 97% clock cycles over all clock cycles. Hence, our implementation is close to optimal in the sense that it has only less than 3% overhead in multiplication and no further improvement is possible as long as Montgomery multiplication based algorithm is used.

For this reason this paper shows the results of several experiments to study relation between memory allocation style of AES parameters and granularity as the parallelism exploited from AES encoding process using CUDA with NVIDIA Geforce GTX285. The result of experiments cleared up that the 16Byte/thread granularity had the highest performance and it achieved approximately 35Gbps throughput. Moreover, implementation with overlapping between processing and data transfer brought up 22.5Gbps throughput including data transfer time.

Such a 2-D mesh of RTRMs on a DPR-capable FPGA can be utilized for throughput-driven tasks to dynamically offload compute functions on a host coupled system, providing multi-user and multi-context execution on behalf of user demands. For embedded systems, it can be utilized as a highly dynamical platform by providing functional enhancement by module replacement during run-time. The exploration also includes a CA for real-time communication between RTRMs in a 2-D mesh. The presented CA design is based on a novel methodology by applying run-time reconfiguration to increase the performance. The design, the implementation, the performance and the resource utilization is shown for throughput- and real-time-driven CAs.

However, the PSO algorithm suffers from premature convergence and high elapsed time when solving multimodal and large scale engineering problems. This problem becomes an evident drawback for embedded applications in which the microcontrollers often operates at low computational capacity. This paper proposes a hardware implementation of a parallel self-adaptive PSO algorithm based on an attractive-repulsive scheme and using the efficient floating-point arithmetic which performs computations with large dynamic range and high precision. The parallel capabilities of the PSO are exploited by implementing parallel particles directly in hardware in order to decrease the running time. In addition, the attractive-repulsive technique avoids the premature convergence problem by self-adapting the swarm behavior according to its diversity. Synthesis and simulation results for benchmark test problems were performed, demonstrating the correctness of the proposed architectures. Finally, an elapsed time comparison between the hardware and software implementations shows the suitableness of the proposed architecture for embedded applications.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692850/5695271/05695281.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Particle Swarm Optimization Based on the Attractive-Repulsive Scheme for Embedded Applications","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2010.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2010.73","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Particle Swarm Optimization Based on the Attractive-Repulsive Scheme for Embedded Applications","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772001","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5695281/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Particle Swarm Optimization Based on the Attractive-Repulsive Scheme for Embedded Applications","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4314a055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072855S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692850","isNumber":"5695271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692850","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5695271","articleId":"5695281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695291,"authors":[{"name":"Azad Fakhari","affiliation":["Computer faculty, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Azad","lastName":"Fakhari","id":"37991193100"},{"name":"Mahmood Fathy","affiliation":["Computer faculty, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Fathy","id":"37266676300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9523-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4314-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5695291","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Clocks","Registers","Computer architecture","Flip-flops","Image coding","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","field programmable gate arrays","parallel architectures","pipeline arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two level architecture","DCT-processor","FPGA","frequency analysis","discrete cosine transform","image processing algorithms","Xilinx Virtex5","image matrix","clock pulse"]}],"abstract":"Frequency analysis using discrete cosine transform is being used in a large variety of algorithms such as image processing algorithms.

Since recursive calls are not directly supported by hardware description languages, they are implemented using the model of a hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM). Parallel processing is achieved by constructing N binary trees (N>;1) and applying concurrent sorting to N trees at the same time with the aid of N communicating HFSMs. The paper presents new results in: 1) parallel sorting algorithms, 2) FPGA-based parallel architectures, and 3) the analysis and comparison of alternative and competitive techniques for implementing parallel recursive algorithms.

high quality non-uniform random numbers (RNs) is essential. The implementation of such generators in FPGA-based accelerators has therefore become a very active research field. In this paper we present a novel approach to create RNs for different distributions based on an efficient transformation of floating-point inputs. For the Gaussian distribution we can reduce the number of slices needed by up to 48% compared to the state-of-the-art while achieving a higher output precision in the tail region. Our architecture produces samples up to 8.37\u03c3 and achieves 381MHz. We also present a comprehensive testing methodology based on stochastic analysis and verification in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2010.20","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692850/5695271/05695304.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2010.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Hardware Efficient Inversion Based Random Number Generator for Non-uniform Distributions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695304/","displayDocTitle":"A New Hardware Efficient Inversion Based Random Number Generator for Non-uniform Distributions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772018","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695304/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Hardware Efficient Inversion Based Random Number Generator for Non-uniform Distributions","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4314a190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080411S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692850","isNumber":"5695271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692850","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5695271","articleId":"5695304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695307,"authors":[{"name":"Wendi Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wendi","lastName":"Wang","id":"38008907900"},{"name":"Bo Duan","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Duan","id":"38004499800"},{"name":"Chunming Zhang","affiliation":["High Performance Computer Research Center, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38002491700"},{"name":"Peiheng Zhang","affiliation":["High Performance Computer Research Center, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Peiheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37957889000"},{"name":"Ninghui Sun","affiliation":["High Performance Computer Research Center, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Ninghui","lastName":"Sun","id":"37287666000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9523-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4314-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5695307","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"abstract":"The emergence of embedded and multimedia applications, which have a data-centric favor to them, have great influences on the design methodology of future systems. The 2D FFT is of particular importance to these applications. In this paper, leveraging the reconfigurable features of off-the-shelf FPGAs, we propose a stream architecture that is suitable for accelerating 2D FFT with variable and non-power-of-two problem size. The system is built upon the concept of coarse-grained and application-specific pipeline and is optimized for 2D and real data FFT specifically. Separating data flow from computing flow and providing hardware support for data flow permutation involved in 2D FFT, our design outperforms previous work by 1:8 21 times. Moreover, when facing real data, the speed will further increase by nearly 100%. To increase designer productivity, we reinforced traditional HDL-based hardware design flow with High-Level Synthesis concept. The prototyping system on a customized FPGA-based accelerator card can operate in 200MHz stably.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692850/5695271/05695307.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2010.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2010.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating 2D FFT with Non-Power-of-Two Problem Size on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Algorithm design and analysis","Acceleration","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow computing","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","pipeline processing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D FFT","nonpower-of-two problem size","data centric favor","stream architecture","application specific pipeline","computing flow","hardware support","data flow permutation","HDL based hardware design flow","high level synthesis concept","prototyping system","customized FPGA-based accelerator card"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating 2D FFT with Non-Power-of-Two Problem Size on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695307/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772021","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating 2D FFT with Non-Power-of-Two Problem Size on FPGA","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4314a208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071926S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692850","isNumber":"5695271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692850","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5695271","articleId":"5695307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5695311,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Reza Akoushideh","affiliation":["Electronic Group, Shahid Chamran Institute of Technology, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali Reza","lastName":"Akoushideh","id":"37991199800"},{"name":"Asadollah Shahbahrami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Asadollah","lastName":"Shahbahrami","id":"37398211900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9523-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4314-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5695311","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Feature extraction","Pixel","Clocks","Classification algorithms","Table lookup","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture features extraction algorithm","FPGA architecture","image pixel","cooccurrence matrix","gray level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Haralick texture feature","Image processing","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Statistical texture features extraction algorithms can be classified into first, second, and higher order. The difference between these classes is that the first-order statistics estimate properties of individual image pixel values, while in the second and higher order statistics estimate properties of two or more image pixel values occurring at specific locations relative to each other. The most popular second order statistical texture features are derived from the co-occurrence matrix, which has been proposed by Haralick. However, the computation of both matrix and extracting texture features are very time consuming. In this paper we improve the performance of those algorithms using FPGA implementations. Our experimental results show that the computational time of co-occurrence matrix is 6.74 times faster than the computational time of extracting thirteen texture features for an image size 128\u00d7128 and 8bit gray level.

The detection of multiple-combined faults is still a demanding task, difficult to accomplish even with computing intensive techniques. This work introduces a low-cost, real-time FPGA-based hardware processing unit for multiple-combined fault detection utilizing information entropy and artificial neural networks as tools for analyzing the information contents of the 3-axis vibration signals from the rotary machine during the startup transient.

Unfortunately, the security of cryptographic implementations is threatened by Side Channel Analysis (SCA). SCA attempts to discover the secret key of a device by exploiting implementation characteristics and bypassing the algorithm's mathematical security. Differential Power Analysis (DPA) is a type of SCA, which exploits the device's power consumption characteristics. Several countermeasures to DPA have been proposed, however, all of them increase security at the cost of increased area which in-turn leads to increased power consumption and reduced throughput. FPGAs are popular due to their reconfigurability, lower development cost, off-the-shelf availability and shorter time to market. Block RAMs (BRAM) are large memories in FPGAs that are commonly used as ROM, FIFO, Look-up tables, etc. In this paper we explore the DPA resistance of BRAMs in Xilinx FPGAs and verify if their usage can improve the security. The results of our Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implementations show that using BRAMs alone can improve the security over a look-up table (LUT) only design 9 times. Applying Separated Dynamic Differential Logic (SDDL) for FPGAs, a countermeasure against DPA, to this design doubles the security again leading to an 18 fold increase over the unprotected LUT design.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2010.80","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692850/5695271/05695318.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2010.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of DPA Resistance of Block RAMs in Cryptographic Implementations on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695318/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of DPA Resistance of Block RAMs in Cryptographic Implementations on FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695318/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772030","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of DPA Resistance of Block RAMs in Cryptographic Implementations on FPGAs","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4314a274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096571S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692850","isNumber":"5695271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692850","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5695271","articleId":"5695318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695320,"authors":[{"name":"Mieczyslaw Jessa","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Mieczyslaw","lastName":"Jessa","id":"37332091500"},{"name":"Michal Jaworski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Jaworski","id":"38000784300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9523-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4314-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5695320","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","NIST","Field programmable gate arrays","Random sequences","Entropy","Complexity theory","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","field programmable gate arrays","random number generation","random sequences","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed FPGA based pseudorandom generators","field programmable gate array","number sequences","NIST 800-22 statistical test suite","cryptography","pseudorandom sequences","word length 31 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pseudorandom generators","shuffling","combining bit streams","cryptography"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose the use of a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to construct high-speed pseudorandom generators with extremely long periods of generated number sequences. The output streams pass all statistical tests from the NIST 800-22 statistical test suite. The numbers are encoded using only 31 bits. We show that by implementing many generators in a single FPGA, a new source of pseudorandom sequences with extremely long periods can be obtained. This source produces sequences that pass the NIST 800-22 statistical tests and the bit rate of the output stream is k times greater, where k is the number of 31-bit generators used. The upper limit of the bit rate depends on the number of 31-bit generators that produce streams passing all NIST 800-22 statistical tests. Although the new generator is not secure, it can be used in cryptography if an auxiliary source of pseudorandom numbers is implemented in the same FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2010.32","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692850/5695271/05695320.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2010.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed FPGA-Based Pseudorandom Generators with Extremely Long Periods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695320/","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed FPGA-Based Pseudorandom Generators with Extremely Long Periods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772032","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695320/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed FPGA-Based Pseudorandom Generators with Extremely Long Periods","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4314a286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076925S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692850","isNumber":"5695271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692850","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5695271","articleId":"5695320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5695321,"authors":[{"name":"Aric Schorr","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Aric","lastName":"Schorr","id":"38003420800"},{"name":"Marcin Lukowiak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Lukowiak","id":"37354410500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9523-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4314-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5695321","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Memory management","NIST","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","file organisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate array hardware","Skein tree hashing mode","sequential hashing cores","custom FPGA hardware","scalable control logic","high-speed parallel hashing hardware","leaf-size","nodefanout","internal block size","core assignment strategy","sequential designs","bit rate 3 Gbit/s","bit rate 5.6 Gbit/s","bit rate 1.6 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on design and analysis of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware for Skein's tree hashing mode.

We also propose a grey-box approach, where intermediate random variables are unknown to the attacker. We show that such approach allows to reduce the complexity by using fewer tables.

A significant comparison between the submitted candidates is only possible, if third party implementations of all proposed hash functions are provided. Our work is for the most part motivated by future developments of mass markets, where cryptographic infrastructures will become more and more important. One core component of such an infrastructure is a secure cryptographic hash function, which is used for a lot of applications like challenge-response authentication systems or digital signature schemes. We chose to evaluate the Gr\u00f8stl hash function as one of the candidates heavily influenced by the AES algorithm, because there is reasonable hope to reduce the area of the cryptographic infrastructure by integrating AES and one of these hash algorithms on a FPGA. Hence, Gr\u00f8stl serves as an example for the hash functions related to the AES approach. Our focus on low budget cryptographic solutions makes it natural to investigate possible optimizations for area efficient implementations, alongside our high-throughput variant. Our results show, that - while Gr\u00f8stl is inherently quite large compared to AES - it is possible to implement the Gr\u00f8stl algorithm on small and low budget FPGAs like the second smallest available Spartan-3, while maintaining a reasonably high throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772036","htmlLink":"/document/5695325/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On FPGA-Based Implementations of the SHA-3 Candidate Gr\u00f8stl","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On FPGA-Based Implementations of the SHA-3 Candidate Gr\u00f8stl","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4314a316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05738S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692850","isNumber":"5695271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692850","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5695271","articleId":"5695325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5695326,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo P.

A circuit capable of inverting a nonsingular N\u00d7N matrix in exactly N clock cycles is introduced, described, and tested in FPGA devices.

The time complexity of the proposed circuit is fixed (N clock cycles), which is important when the circuit must be used as part of a high performance or real-time system. The overall circuit operation is based on the Gauss-Jordan (GJ) elimination method, with the addition of several modifications in order to make the algorithm more hardware-oriented. The resulting hardware is still compact compared to a direct implementation of the traditional GJ algorithm, however less compact than the variable-time implementation referred to above.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2010.86","startPage":"322","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692850/5695271/05695326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2010.86","endPage":"327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved GF(2) Matrix Inverter with Linear Time Complexity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Improved GF(2) Matrix Inverter with Linear Time Complexity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695326/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11791750","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved GF(2) Matrix Inverter with Linear Time Complexity","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4314a322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050422S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692850","isNumber":"5695271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692850","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5695271","articleId":"5695326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695337,"authors":[{"name":"Sasmita Deo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Sasmita","lastName":"Deo","id":"37996005500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9523-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4314-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5695337","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Capacitance","Field programmable gate arrays","Leakage current","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","field programmable gate arrays","leakage currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption calculation","AP-DCD algorithm","FPGA platform","total power dissipation","field programmable gate arrays","dynamic power dissipation","static power dissipation","leakage current","supply voltage","effective capacitance","toggling frequency","Xilinx-Virtex-II Pro XC2VP30 device","dichotomous coordinate descent iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AP-DCD","FPGA","Xilinx","Dynamic power","Static power","Effective Capacitance"]}],"abstract":"This paper presented the analysis of total power dissipation of AP-DCD algorithm using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

The optimization problem is formulated as the minimization of the end-effector position and orientation error so as to ensure convergence towards the learnt path taking into account a time constraint. To solve the optimization problem an algorithm based on the basic Evolution Strategies (ES) scheme is used. ES is a stochastic direct search optimization method based on the evolution of a candidate solution population in an iterative process of mutation and selection. The algorithm avoids singularities since it does not require the use of the Jacobian matrix in the kinematic inversion.

However, the majority of these methods require a long time to obtain a feasible solution since large quantities of DNA template need to be analyzed and a specific PCR product size is not provided. Recently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been applied to solve many problems and yield good results. However, it is easily traped into a local optimal solution when the problem is complicated. In this paper, a novel logistic map is proposed to determine the value of inertia weight of PSO to design feasible primers (NCIWPSO). Accuracies for the primer design of the Homo sapiens RNA binding motif protein 11 (RBM11), mRNA (NM_144770), and the Homo sapiens G protein-coupled receptor 78 (GPR78), mRNA (NM_080819) were calculated. Five hundred runs of PSO and the NCIWPSO primer design methods performed different PCR product lengths with different melting temperature calculations. A comparison of the accuracies for PSO and the NCIWPSO primer design showed that the NCIWPSO is superior to PSO for primer design. The proposed method is effective for finding more feasible primer sets than PSO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695479/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11772134","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695479/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Chaotic Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimization for PCR Primer Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Chaotic Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimization for PCR Primer Design","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4253a373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094116S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692853","isNumber":"5695423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692853","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5695423","articleId":"5695479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5695493,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Chieh Huang","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Chieh","lastName":"Huang","id":"38006535800"},{"name":"Remi Coulom","affiliation":["University of Lille (USTL), France"],"firstName":"Remi","lastName":"Coulom","id":"37991071500"},{"name":"Shun-Shii Lin","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shun-Shii","lastName":"Lin","id":"37067208500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8668-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4253-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6816"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6824"}],"articleNumber":"5695493","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695493","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Computers","Resource management","Monte Carlo methods","Testing","Books","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","Monte Carlo methods","time management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time management","Monte-Carlo tree search","Game of Go","Go-playing programs","sudden-death time controls","GNU Go"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carlo tree search","game of Go","time management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAAI.2010.78","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692853/5695423/05695493.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAAI.2010.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Management for Monte-Carlo Tree Search Applied to the Game of Go","abstract":"Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a new technique that has produced a huge leap forward in the strength of Go-playing programs.

Experiments demonstrate that the most basic algorithm for sudden-death time controls(dividing the remaining time by a constant) produces a winning rate of 43.2\u00b12.2% against GNU Go 3.8 Level 2, whereas our most efficient time-allocation strategy can reach a winning rate of 60\u00b12.2% without pondering and 67.4\u00b12.1% with pondering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5695493/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11772146","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Time Management for Monte-Carlo Tree Search Applied to the Game of Go","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Management for Monte-Carlo Tree Search Applied to the Game of Go","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4253a462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053655S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692853","isNumber":"5695423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692853","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5695423","articleId":"5695493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695498,"authors":[{"name":"Hideki Kato","firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Kato","id":"38004537600"},{"name":"Ikuo Takeuchi","firstName":"Ikuo","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37995410300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8668-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4253-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6816"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6824"}],"articleNumber":"5695498","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Simulation Servers","abstract":"Monte-Carlo tree search is a new best-first tree search algorithm that triggered a revolution in the computer Go world. Developing good parallel Monte-Carlo tree search algorithms is importan because single processor's performance cannot be expected to increase as used to. A novel parallel Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm is proposed. A tree searcher runs on a client computer and multiple Monte-Carlo simulators run on other computers (simulation servers) on a network. The tree searcher broadcasts a position being simulated to every simulator, which then simulates the game from the position to the end and sends the result back to the searcher, if not busy. The statistical information in the search tree is updated by the searcher according to the result. This algorithm can run on a loosely coupled heterogeneous computer cluster, consists of inexpensive personal computers and game consoles, on a moderate speed network and allows users to connect or disconnect the servers on-the-fly, in contrast to ones run on an expensive HPC cluster. Experiments using four quad-core Linux personal computers on a private Gigabit Ethernet LAN show its performance scales well.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692853/5695423/05695498.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"498","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/05695498.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAAI.2010.83","doi":"10.1109/TAAI.2010.83","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695498","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computers","Games","Computational modeling","Instruction sets","Clustering algorithms","Servers","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","local area networks","Monte Carlo methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel Monte Carlo tree search","simulation servers","computer Go world","single processor performance","HPC cluster","quad core Linux personal computers","gigabit Ethernet LAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695498/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Simulation Servers","accessionNumber":"11772151","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5695498/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Simulation Servers","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4253a491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044707S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692853","isNumber":"5695423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692853","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5695423","articleId":"5695498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5695525,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiang-Yun Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiang-Yun","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38008560200"},{"name":"Chung-Hsiang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Hsiang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37933240600"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["IBM Austin Research Laboratory, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37538123800"},{"name":"Chia-Lin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279097400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9071-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"}],"articleNumber":"5695525","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":777},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Instruction sets","Processor scheduling","Programming","System performance","Monitoring","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-threading","processor scheduling","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory latency reduction","thread throttling","processor performance improvement","multicore architecture","decouple application threads","memory tasks","concurrent memory tasks","scheduling restriction","CPU core","allowable memory threads","workload variation","phase detection","analytical model","Intel i7 machine","intelligent run-time scheduling","memory wall"]}],"abstract":"Memory Wall is a well-known obstacle to processor performance improvement. The popularity of multi-core architecture will further exaggerate the problem since the memory resource is shared by all cores. Interferences among requests from different cores may prolong the latency of memory accesses thereby degrading the system performance. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes to decouple application threads into compute and memory tasks, and restrict the number of concurrent memory tasks to avoid the interference among memory requests. Yet with this scheduling restriction, a CPU core may unnecessarily stay idle, which incurs adverse impact on the overall performance. Therefore, we develop a memory thread throttling mechanism that tunes the allowable memory threads dynamically under workload variation to improve system performance. The proposed run-time mechanism monitors memory and computation ratios of a program for phase detection. It then decides the memory thread constraint for the next program phase based on an analytical model that can estimate system performance under different constraint values. To prove the concept, we prototype the mechanism in some real-world applications as well as synthetic workloads. We evaluate their performance on real machines. The experimental results demonstrate up to 20% speedup with a pool of synthetic workloads on an Intel i7 (Nehalem) machine and match with the speedup estimated by the proposed analytical model. Furthermore, the intelligent run-time scheduling leads to a geometric mean of 12% performance improvement for real-world applications on the same hardware.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.39","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695525.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","startPage":"53","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Latency Reduction via Thread Throttling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Memory Latency Reduction via Thread Throttling","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695525/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771963","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695525/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Latency Reduction via Thread Throttling","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084077S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695526,"authors":[{"name":"Yoongu Kim","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Yoongu","lastName":"Kim","id":"38264075800"},{"name":"Michael Papamichael","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Papamichael","id":"37704231100"},{"name":"Onur Mutlu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Mutlu","id":"37265510200"},{"name":"Mor Harchol-Balter","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Mor","lastName":"Harchol-Balter","id":"38273775500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9071-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"}],"articleNumber":"5695526","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":244,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1560},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695526","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Throughput","Scheduling algorithm","Clustering algorithms","Interference","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-threading","processor scheduling","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory scheduling algorithm","system throughput","memory request scheduling policies","thread cluster memory scheduling","memory access behavior","latency sensitive cluster","bandwidth sensitive cluster","niceness metric","memory nonintensive threads","memory intensive threads","multiprogrammed workloads","memory channels","chip-multiprocessor system","shared resource"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memory scheduling","memory access behavior","fairness","system throughput","thread cluster","niceness"]}],"abstract":"In a modern chip-multiprocessor system, memory is a shared resource among multiple concurrently executing threads. The memory scheduling algorithm should resolve memory contention by arbitrating memory access in such a way that competing threads progress at a relatively fast and even pace, resulting in high system throughput and fairness. Previously proposed memory scheduling algorithms are predominantly optimized for only one of these objectives: no scheduling algorithm provides the best system throughput and best fairness at the same time. This paper presents a new memory scheduling algorithm that addresses system throughput and fairness separately with the goal of achieving the best of both. The main idea is to divide threads into two separate clusters and employ different memory request scheduling policies in each cluster. Our proposal, Thread Cluster Memory scheduling (TCM), dynamically groups threads with similar memory access behavior into either the latency-sensitive (memory-non-intensive) or the bandwidth-sensitive (memory-intensive) cluster. TCM introduces three major ideas for prioritization: 1) we prioritize the latency-sensitive cluster over the bandwidth-sensitive cluster to improve system throughput, 2) we introduce a ``niceness'' metric that captures a thread's propensity to interfere with other threads, 3) we use niceness to periodically shuffle the priority order of the threads in the bandwidth-sensitive cluster to provide fair access to each thread in a way that reduces inter-thread interference. On the one hand, prioritizing memory-non-intensive threads significantly improves system throughput without degrading fairness, because such ``light'' threads only use a small fraction of the total available memory bandwidth. On the other hand, shuffling the priority order of memory-intensive threads improves fairness because it ensures no thread is disproportionately slowed down or starved. We evaluate TCM on a wide variety of multiprogrammed workloads and compare its performance to four previously proposed scheduling algorithms, finding that TCM achieves both the best system throughput and fairness. Averaged over 96 workloads on a 24-core system with 4 memory channels, TCM improves system throughput and reduces maximum slowdown by 4.6%/38.6% compared to ATLAS (previous work providing the best system throughput) and 7.6%/4.6% compared to PAR-BS (previous work providing the best fairness).","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.51","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695526.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thread Cluster Memory Scheduling: Exploiting Differences in Memory Access Behavior","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Thread Cluster Memory Scheduling: Exploiting Differences in Memory Access Behavior","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695526/","accessionNumber":"11771960","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thread Cluster Memory Scheduling: Exploiting Differences in Memory Access Behavior","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10378S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"244","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5695527,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Janapa Reddi","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Research Laboratories, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay Janapa","lastName":"Reddi","id":"37293801200"},{"name":"Svilen Kanev","affiliation":["Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Svilen","lastName":"Kanev","id":"37594367300"},{"name":"Wonyoung Kim","affiliation":["Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Wonyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37596892500"},{"name":"Simone Campanoni","affiliation":["Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Campanoni","id":"37594368300"},{"name":"Michael D.

Voltage variation is especially daunting because it happens so rapidly. We measure and characterize voltage variation in a running Intel Core2 Duo processor. By sensing on-die voltage as the processor runs single-threaded, multi-threaded, and multi-program workloads, we determine the average supply voltage swing of the processor to be only 4 percent, far from the processor's 14percent worst-case operating voltage margin. While such large margins guarantee correctness, they penalize performance and power efficiency. We investigate and quantify the benefits of designing a processor for typical-case (rather than worst-case) voltage swings, assuming that a fail-safe mechanism protects it from infrequently occurring large voltage fluctuations. With today's processors, such resilient designs could yield 15 percent to 20 percent performance improvements. But we also show that in future systems, these gains could be lost as increasing voltage swings intensify the frequency of fail-safe recoveries. After characterizing micro architectural activity that leads to voltage swings within multi-core systems, we show that a voltage-noise-aware thread scheduler in software can co-schedule phases of different programs to mitigate error recovery overheads in future resilient processor designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695527.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"88","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage Smoothing: Characterizing and Mitigating Voltage Noise in Production Processors via Software-Guided Thread Scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Noise","Voltage measurement","Impedance","Capacitors","Capacitance","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit noise","low-power electronics","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading","power aware computing","processor scheduling","smoothing circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage smoothing","voltage noise","production processors","software-guided thread scheduling","microprocessor design","voltage variation","Intel Core 2 Duo processor","on-die voltage","multiprogram workloads","average supply voltage swing","power efficiency","fail-safe mechanism","voltage fluctuations","resilient designs","microarchitectural activity","multicore systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dI/dt","inductive noise","error resiliency","voltage droop","hw/sw co-design","thread scheduling","hardware reliability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Voltage Smoothing: Characterizing and Mitigating Voltage Noise in Production Processors via Software-Guided Thread Scheduling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695527/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771964","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage Smoothing: Characterizing and Mitigating Voltage Noise in Production Processors via Software-Guided Thread Scheduling","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084315S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695528,"authors":[{"name":"Yoav Etsion","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Yoav","lastName":"Etsion","id":"37295074800"},{"name":"Felipe Cabarcas","affiliation":["Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia","Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Felipe","lastName":"Cabarcas","id":"37283024100"},{"name":"Alejandro Rico","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Rico","id":"37393772800"},{"name":"Alex Ramirez","affiliation":["Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain","Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Ramirez","id":"37275843200"},{"name":"Rosa M.

Utilizing intuitive programmer annotations of task inputs and outputs, the task super scalar pipeline dynamically detects inter-task data dependencies, identifies task-level parallelism, and executes tasks out-of-order. Furthermore, we propose a design for a distributed task super scalar pipeline front end, that can be embedded into any many core fabric, and manages cores as functional units. We show that our proposed mechanism is capable of driving hundreds of cores simultaneously with non-speculative tasks, which allows our pipeline to sustain work windows consisting of tens of thousands of tasks. We further show that our pipeline can maintain a decode rate faster than 60ns per task and dynamically uncover data dependencies among as many as ~50,000 in-flight tasks, using 7MB of on-chip eDRAM storage. This configuration achieves speedups of 95-255x (average 183x) over sequential execution for nine scientific benchmarks, running on a simulated CMP with 256 cores.

To mitigate these effects over a chip's lifetime, this paper proposes Colt, a simple yet holistic scheme to balance the utilization of devices in a processor by equalizing the duty cycle ratio of circuits'internal nodes and the usage frequency of devices. Colt relies on alternating true-and complement-mode operations to equalize the duty cycle ratio of signals (thus the utilization of devices) in most data path and storage devices. Colt also employs a pseudorandom indexing scheme to balance the usage of entries in storage structures that often exhibit highly uneven utilization of entries. Finally, an operand-swapping scheme equalizes utilization of the left and right operand data paths. The proposed mechanisms impose trivial overhead in area, complexity, power, and performance, while recapturing 27% of aging-induced performance degradation and improving meantime to failure by an estimated 40%.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.37","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695529.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combating Aging with the Colt Duty Cycle Equalizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695529/","displayDocTitle":"Combating Aging with the Colt Duty Cycle Equalizer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11791720","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695529/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combating Aging with the Colt Duty Cycle Equalizer","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073657S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695530,"authors":[{"name":"Nak Hee Seong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Nak Hee","lastName":"Seong","id":"37595914600"},{"name":"Dong Hyuk Woo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","Platform Architecture Research, Intel Labs, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Dong Hyuk","lastName":"Woo","id":"37595936800"},{"name":"Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan","affiliation":["IBM T.

One main roadblock for wider adoption of these new memories is the limited write endurance, which leads to wear-out related permanent failures. Furthermore, technology scaling increases the variation in cell lifetime resulting in early failures of many cells. Existing error correcting techniques are primarily devised for recovering from transient faults and are not suitable for recovering from permanent stuck-at faults, which tend to increase gradually with repeated write cycles. In this paper, we propose SAFER, a novel hardware-efficient multi-bit stuck-at fault error recovery scheme for resistive memories, which can function in conjunction with existing wear-leveling techniques. SAFER exploits the key attribute that a failed cell with a stuck-at value is still readable, making it possible to continue to use the failed cell to store data, thereby reducing the hardware overhead for error recovery. SAFER partitions a data block dynamically while ensuring that there is at most one fail bit per partition and uses single error correction techniques per partition for fail recovery. SAFER increases the number of recoverable fails and achieves better lifetime improvement with smaller hardware overhead relative to recently proposed Error Correcting Pointers and even ideal hamming coding scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.46","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.46","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695530.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAFER: Stuck-At-Fault Error Recovery for Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SAFER: Stuck-At-Fault Error Recovery for Memories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771966","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695530/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAFER: Stuck-At-Fault Error Recovery for Memories","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057978S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695532,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Y.

Flex Core provides an efficient platform that can support a broad range of run-time monitoring and bookkeeping techniques. Unlike using custom hardware, which is more efficient but often extremely difficult and expensive to incorporate into a modern microprocessor, the Flex Core architecture allows parallel monitoring and bookkeeping functions to be dynamically added to the processing core and adapt to application needs even after the chip has been fabricated. At the same time, Flex Core is far more efficient than software implementations because its fine-grained reconfigurable architecture closely matches bit level operations of typical monitoring schemes and allows monitoring schemes to operate in parallel to the monitored core. In fact, our experimental results show that monitoring on Flex Core can almost match the performance of full ASIC implementations. To evaluate the Flex Core architecture, we implemented an RTL prototype along with several extensions including uninitialized memory read checking, dynamic information flow tracking, array bound checking, and soft error checking. The prototypes demonstrate that the architecture can support a range of monitoring extensions with different characteristics in an efficient manner. Flex Core takes moderate silicon area and results in far better performance and energy efficiency than software.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.17","startPage":"137","endPage":"148","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695532.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible and Efficient Instruction-Grained Run-Time Monitoring Using On-Chip Reconfigurable Fabric","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Computer architecture","Fabrics","Software","Hardware","Registers","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction-grained run-time monitoring","on-chip reconfigurable fabric","hybrid processor architecture","FPGA","main processing core","bookkeeping techniques","custom hardware","FlexCore architecture","chip fabrication","software implementations","fine-grained reconfigurable architecture","bit- level operations","ASIC","RTL prototype","silicon area","energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coprocessing Architecture","Reconfigurability","Security","Reliability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Flexible and Efficient Instruction-Grained Run-Time Monitoring Using On-Chip Reconfigurable Fabric","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11791722","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible and Efficient Instruction-Grained Run-Time Monitoring Using On-Chip Reconfigurable Fabric","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097505S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5695533,"authors":[{"name":"Aamer Jaleel","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, VSSAD, USA"],"firstName":"Aamer","lastName":"Jaleel","id":"37298078500"},{"name":"Eric Borch","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, VSSAD, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Borch","id":"37886702500"},{"name":"Malini Bhandaru","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, VSSAD, USA"],"firstName":"Malini","lastName":"Bhandaru","id":"37612069700"},{"name":"Simon C.

However, the trade-off has been lower performance compared to non-inclusive and exclusive caches. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that the limited performance of inclusive caches is mostly due to inclusion victims - lines that are evicted from the core caches to satisfy the inclusion property - and not the reduced cache capacity of the hierarchy due to the duplication of data. These inclusion victims are incorrectly chosen for replacement because the last-level cache (LLC) is unaware of the temporal locality of lines in the core caches. We propose Temporal Locality Aware (TLA) cache management policies to allow an inclusive LLC to be aware of the temporal locality of lines in the core caches. We propose three TLA policies: Temporal Locality Hints (TLH), Early Core Invalidation (ECI), and Query Based Selection (QBS). All three policies improve inclusive cache performance without requiring any additional hardware structures. In fact, QBS performs similar to a non-inclusive cache hierarchy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Non-Inclusive Cache Performance with Inclusive Caches: Temporal Locality Aware (TLA) Cache Management Policies","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.52","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695533.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Non-Inclusive Cache Performance with Inclusive Caches: Temporal Locality Aware (TLA) Cache Management Policies","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695533/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771968","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Non-Inclusive Cache Performance with Inclusive Caches: Temporal Locality Aware (TLA) Cache Management Policies","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051104S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5695535,"authors":[{"name":"Samira Manabi Khan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Samira Manabi","lastName":"Khan","id":"37587691000"},{"name":"Yingying Tian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Yingying","lastName":"Tian","id":"38001362600"},{"name":"Daniel A.

They can be quite inefficient. On average, a cache block in a 2MB LRU-managed LLC is dead 86% of the time, i.e., it will not be referenced again before it is evicted. This paper introduces sampling dead block prediction, a technique that samples program counters (PCs) to determine when a cache block is likely to be dead. Rather than learning from accesses and evictions from every set in the cache, a sampling predictor keeps track of a small number of sets using partial tags. Sampling allows the predictor to use far less state than previous predictors to make predictions with superior accuracy. Dead block prediction can be used to drive a dead block replacement and bypass optimization. A sampling predictor can reduce the number of LLC misses over LRU by 11.7% for memory-intensive single-thread benchmarks and 23% for multi-core workloads. The reduction in misses yields a geometric mean speedup of 5.9% for single-thread benchmarks and a geometric mean normalized weighted speedup of 12.5% for multi-core workloads. Due to the reduced state and number of accesses, the sampling predictor consumes only 3.1% of the of the dynamic power and 1.2% of the leakage power of a baseline 2MB LLC, comparing favorably with more costly techniques. The sampling predictor can even be used to significantly improve a cache with a default random replacement policy.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.24","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695535.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Dead Block Prediction for Last-Level Caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695535/","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Dead Block Prediction for Last-Level Caches","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695535/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771967","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Dead Block Prediction for Last-Level Caches","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078684S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695536,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Sanchez","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Sanchez","id":"37531401100"},{"name":"Christos Kozyrakis","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Kozyrakis","id":"37282352700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9071-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"}],"articleNumber":"5695536","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Bandwidth","Indexes","Radiation detectors","Process control","Delay","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","content-addressable storage","multiprocessing systems","multiprogramming","multi-threading","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ZCache","decoupling way","associativity","main memory latency","skew associative cache","cuckoo hashing","probability distribution","set associative cache","multithreading","multiprogramming","chip multiprocessor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cache","associativity","performance","multi-core","energy efficiency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695536","abstract":"The ever-increasing importance of main memory latency and bandwidth is pushing CMPs towards caches with higher capacity and associativity. Associativity is typically improved by increasing the number of ways. This reduces conflict misses, but increases hit latency and energy, placing a stringent trade-off on cache design. We present the zcache, a cache design that allows much higher associativity than the number of physical ways (e.g. a 64-associative cache with 4 ways). The zcache draws on previous research on skew-associative caches and cuckoo hashing. Hits, the common case, require a single lookup, incurring the latency and energy costs of a cache with a very low number of ways. On a miss, additional tag lookups happen off the critical path, yielding an arbitrarily large number of replacement candidates for the incoming block. Unlike conventional designs, the zcache provides associativity by increasing the number of replacement candidates, but not the number of cache ways. To understand the implications of this approach, we develop a general analysis framework that allows to compare associativity across different cache designs (e.g. a set-associative cache and a zcache) by representing associativity as a probability distribution. We use this framework to show that for zcaches, associativity depends only on the number of replacement candidates, and is independent of other factors (such as the number of cache ways or the workload). We also show that, for the same number of replacement candidates, the associativity of a zcache is superior than that of a set-associative cache for most workloads. Finally, we perform detailed simulations of multithreaded and multiprogrammed workloads on a large-scale CMP with zcache as the last-level cache. We show that zcaches provide higher performance and better energy efficiency than conventional caches without incurring the overheads of designs with a large number of ways.","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","startPage":"187","endPage":"198","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.20","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695536.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ZCache: Decoupling Ways and Associativity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695536/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"The ZCache: Decoupling Ways and Associativity","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11791723","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695536/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ZCache: Decoupling Ways and Associativity","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105837S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695537,"authors":[{"name":"Rajkishore Barik","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajkishore","lastName":"Barik","id":"37574723800"},{"name":"Jisheng Zhao","affiliation":["Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jisheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37405217300"},{"name":"Vivek Sarkar","affiliation":["Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37389286300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9071-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"}],"articleNumber":"5695537","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":519},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Tiles","Optimization","Dynamic compiler","Heuristic algorithms","Dynamic programming","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","instruction sets","parallel processing","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector instruction","dynamic programming","SIMD vector","SSE","MMX","VSE","vector code generation","auto vectorization framework","dynamic compiler","instruction scheduler","register allocator","straight line code","scalar packing","algebraic reassociation","algebraic simplification","RVM dynamic compilation","SIMD parallelization","Intel Fortran compiler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vectorization","Instruction Selection","Dynamic Programming","Dynamic Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695537","abstract":"Accelerating program performance via SIMD vector units is very common in modern processors, as evidenced by the use of SSE, MMX, VSE, and VSX SIMD instructions in multimedia, scientific, and embedded applications. To take full advantage of the vector capabilities, a compiler needs to generate efficient vector code automatically. However, most commercial and open-source compilers fall short of using the full potential of vector units, and only generate vector code for simple innermost loops. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an auto-vectorization framework in the back-end of a dynamic compiler that not only generates optimized vector code but is also well integrated with the instruction scheduler and register allocator. The framework includes a novel compile-time efficient dynamic programming-based vector instruction selection algorithm for straight-line code that expands opportunities for vectorization in the following ways: (1) scalar packing explores opportunities of packing multiple scalar variables into short vectors; (2) judicious use of shuffle and horizontal vector operations, when possible; and (3) algebraic reassociation expands opportunities for vectorization by algebraic simplification. We report performance results on the impact of autovectorization on a set of standard numerical benchmarks using the Jikes RVM dynamic compilation environment. Our results show performance improvement of up to 57.71% on an Intel Xeon processor, compared to non-vectorized execution, with a modest increase in compile-time in the range from 0.87% to 9.992%. An investigation of the SIMD parallelization performed by v11.1 of the Intel Fortran Compiler (IFC) on three benchmarks shows that our system achieves speedup with vectorization in all three cases and IFC does not. Finally, a comparison of our approach with an implementation of the Superword Level Parallelization (SLP) algorithm from, shows that our approach yields a performance improvement of up to 13.78% relative to SLP.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695537.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.38","startPage":"201","endPage":"212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Selection of Vector Instructions Using Dynamic Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695537/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Selection of Vector Instructions Using Dynamic Programming","htmlLink":"/document/5695537/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11791724","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Selection of Vector Instructions Using Dynamic Programming","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097436S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695538,"authors":[{"name":"Jaekyu Lee","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jaekyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"38008722600"},{"name":"Nagesh B.

One solution used in conventional CPU systems is prefetching, both in hardware and software. However, we show that straightforwardly applying such mechanisms to GPGPU systems does not deliver the expected performance benefits and can in fact hurt performance when not used judiciously. This paper proposes new hardware and software prefetching mechanisms tailored to GPGPU systems, which we refer to as many-thread aware prefetching (MT-prefetching) mechanisms. Our software MT-prefetching mechanism, called inter-thread prefetching, exploits the existence of common memory access behavior among fine-grained threads. For hardware MT-prefetching, we describe a scalable prefetcher training algorithm along with a hardware-based inter-thread prefetching mechanism. In some cases, blindly applying prefetching degrades performance. To reduce such negative effects, we propose an adaptive prefetch throttling scheme, which permits automatic GPGPU application- and hardware-specific adjustment. We show that adaptation reduces the negative effects of prefetching and can even improve performance. Overall, compared to the state-of-the-art software and hardware prefetching, our MT-prefetching improves performance on average by 16%(software pref.)/15% (hardware pref.) on our benchmarks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","startPage":"213","endPage":"224","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695538.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Many-Thread Aware Prefetching Mechanisms for GPGPU Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5695538/","displayDocTitle":"Many-Thread Aware Prefetching Mechanisms for GPGPU Applications","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771970","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Many-Thread Aware Prefetching Mechanisms for GPGPU Applications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077973S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5695539,"authors":[{"name":"Eric S.

Single-chip heterogeneous computing has the potential to achieve greater energy efficiency by combining traditional processors with unconventional cores (U-cores) such as custom logic, FPGAs, or GPGPUs. Although U-cores are effective at increasing performance, their benefits can also diminish given the scarcity of projected bandwidth in the future. To understand the relative merits between different approaches in the face of technology constraints, this work builds on prior modeling of heterogeneous multicores to support U-cores. Unlike prior models that trade performance, power, and area using well-known relationships between simple and complex processors, our model must consider the less-obvious relationships between conventional processors and a diverse set of U-cores. Further, our model supports speculation of future designs from scaling trends predicted by the ITRS road map. The predictive power of our model depends upon U-core-specific parameters derived by measuring performance and power of tuned applications on today's state-of-the-art multicores, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs. Our results reinforce some current-day understandings of the potential and limitations of U-cores and also provides new insights on their relative merits.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.36","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695539.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Chip Heterogeneous Computing: Does the Future Include Custom Logic, FPGAs, and GPGPUs?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-Chip Heterogeneous Computing: Does the Future Include Custom Logic, FPGAs, and GPGPUs?","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11791725","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695539/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695539/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Chip Heterogeneous Computing: Does the Future Include Custom Logic, FPGAs, and GPGPUs?","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116474S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5695540,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Steffen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Steffen","id":"37542708200"},{"name":"Joseph Zambreno","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Zambreno","id":"37393987200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9071-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"}],"articleNumber":"5695540","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Rendering (computer graphics)","Registers","Hardware","Runtime","Computer architecture","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","multi-threading","operating system kernels","program diagnostics","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIMT efficiency","global rendering algorithm","architectural support","dynamic micro kernel","single instruction multiple thread","static allocation","thread group","application kernel","individual thread branching","convergence algorithm","parallel thread","processor utilization"]}],"abstract":"Wide Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) architectures often require a static allocation of thread groups that are executed in lockstep throughout the entire application kernel. Individual thread branching is supported by executing all control flow paths for threads in a thread group and only committing the results of threads on the current control path. While convergence algorithms are used to maximize processor efficiency during branching operations, applications requiring complex control flow often result in low processor efficiency due to the length and quantity of control paths. Global rendering algorithms are an example of a class of application that can be accelerated using a large number of independent parallel threads that each require complex control flow, resulting in comparatively low efficiency on SIMT processors. To improve processor utilization for global rendering algorithms, we introduce a SIMT architecture that allows for threads to be created dynamically at runtime. Large application kernels are broken down into smaller code blocks we call \u03bc-kernels that dynamically created threads can execute. These runtime \u03bckernels allow for the removal of branching statements that would cause divergence within a thread group, and result in new threads being created and grouped with threads beginning execution of the same \u03bc-kernel. In our evaluation of SIMT processor efficiency for a global rendering algorithms, dynamic \u03bc-kernels improved processor performance by an average of 1.4x.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.45","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695540.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","startPage":"237","endPage":"248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving SIMT Efficiency of Global Rendering Algorithms with Architectural Support for Dynamic Micro-Kernels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving SIMT Efficiency of Global Rendering Algorithms with Architectural Support for Dynamic Micro-Kernels","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695540/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771971","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695540/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving SIMT Efficiency of Global Rendering Algorithms with Architectural Support for Dynamic Micro-Kernels","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065534S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695549,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy N.

A very effective approach to improving the energy efficiency of a chip is to lower its supply voltage to very close to the transitor's threshold voltage, into what is called the near-thresold region. This reduces power consumption dramatically but also decreases reliability by orders of magnitude, especially for SRAM structures such as caches. This paper presents Parichute, a novel and powerful error correction technique based on turbo product codes that allows caches to continue to operate in near-threshold, while trading off some cache capacity to store error correction information. Our Parichute-based cache implementation is flexible, allowing protection to be disabled in error-free high voltage operation and selectively enabled as the voltage is lowered and the error rate increases. Parichute is also self-testing and variation-aware, allowing selective protection of cache sections that exhibit errors at higher supply voltages because of process variation. Parichute achieves significantly stronger error correction compared to prior cache protection techniques, enabling 2\u00d7 to 4\u00d7 higher cache capacity at low voltages. Our results also show that a system with a Parichute-protected L2 cache can achieve a 34% reduction in system energy (processor and DRAM) compared to a system operating at nominal voltage.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Decoding","Error correction","Transistors","Random access memory","Error analysis","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","energy conservation","error correction codes","microprocessor chips","SRAM chips","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized turbocode","error correction codes","near-threshold cache","energy efficiency","microprocessor designers","SRAM","Parichute","cache protection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695549","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.28","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.28","startPage":"351","endPage":"362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parichute: Generalized Turbocode-Based Error Correction for Near-Threshold Caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parichute: Generalized Turbocode-Based Error Correction for Near-Threshold Caches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695549/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695549/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771977","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parichute: Generalized Turbocode-Based Error Correction for Near-Threshold Caches","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134034S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5695550,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Vogelsang","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Vogelsang","id":"37394738300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9071-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"}],"articleNumber":"5695550","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2603},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695550","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Logic gates","Arrays","Capacitance","Transistors","Driver circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","low-power electronics","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","dynamic random access memories","flexible DRAM power model","power usage","DRAM power reduction schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","power"]}],"abstract":"Energy consumption has become a major constraint on the capabilities of computer systems. In large systems the energy consumed by Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAM) is a significant part of the total energy consumption. It is possible to calculate the energy consumption of currently available DRAMs from their datasheets, but datasheets don't allow extrapolation to future DRAM technologies and don't show how other changes like increasing bandwidth requirements change DRAM energy consumption. This paper first presents a flexible DRAM power model which uses a description of DRAM architecture, technology and operation to calculate power usage and verifies it against datasheet values. Then the model is used together with assumptions about the DRAM roadmap to extrapolate DRAM energy consumption to future DRAM generations. Using this model we evaluate some of the proposed DRAM power reduction schemes.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.42","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695550.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Energy Consumption of Dynamic Random Access Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Energy Consumption of Dynamic Random Access Memories","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695550/","accessionNumber":"11771978","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Energy Consumption of Dynamic Random Access Memories","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089857S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5695551,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Stuecheli","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA","IBM Corp, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Stuecheli","id":"37594370000"},{"name":"Dimitris Kaseridis","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Kaseridis","id":"37402257000"},{"name":"Hillery C.Hunter","firstName":"Hillery","lastName":"C.Hunter"},{"name":"Lizy K.

DRAM is ubiquitous as a main memory technology, but while DRAM's per-chip density and frequency continue to scale, the time required to refresh its dynamic cells has grown at an alarming rate. This paper shows how currently-employed methods to schedule refresh operations are ineffective in mitigating the significant performance degradation caused by longer refresh times. Current approaches are deficient- they do not effectively exploit the flexibility of DRAMs to postpone refresh operations. This work proposes dynamically reconfigurable predictive mechanisms that exploit the full dynamic range allowed in the JEDEC DDRx SDRAM specifications. The proposed mechanisms are shown to mitigate much of the penalties seen with dense DRAM devices. We refer to the overall scheme as Elastic Refresh, in that the refresh policy is stretched to fit the currently executing workload, such that the maximum benefit of the DRAM flexibility is realized. We extend the GEMS on SIMICS tool-set to include Elastic Refresh. Simulations show the proposed solution provides a 10% average performance improvement over existing techniques across the entire SPEC CPU suite, and up to a 41%improvement for certain workloads.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695551.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","startPage":"375","endPage":"384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Elastic Refresh: Techniques to Mitigate Refresh Penalties in High Density Memory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695551/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11791729","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastic Refresh: Techniques to Mitigate Refresh Penalties in High Density Memory","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068168S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695552,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian M.

Realizing this potential will require significant changes to the way systems interact with storage devices as well as a rethinking of the storage devices themselves. This paper describes the architecture of a prototype PCIe-attached storage array built from emulated PCM storage called Moneta. Moneta provides a carefully designed hardware/software interface that makes issuing and completing accesses atomic. The atomic management interface, combined with hardware scheduling optimizations, and an optimized storage stack increases performance for small, random accesses by 18x and reduces software overheads by 60%. Moneta array sustain 2.8 GB/s for sequential transfers and 541 K random 4 KB IO operations per second (8x higher than a state-of-the-art flash-based SSD). Moneta can perform a 5f 2-byte write in 9 us (5.6x faster than the SSD). Moneta provides a harmonic mean speedup of 2.1x and a maximum speed up of 9x across a range of file system, paging, and database workloads. We also explore trade-offs in Moneta's architecture between performance, power, memory organization, and memory latency.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.33","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695552.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moneta: A High-Performance Storage Array Architecture for Next-Generation, Non-volatile Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Moneta: A High-Performance Storage Array Architecture for Next-Generation, Non-volatile Memories","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11791730","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695552/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moneta: A High-Performance Storage Array Architecture for Next-Generation, Non-volatile Memories","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073313S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5695555,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Bakhoda","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Bakhoda","id":"37644290200"},{"name":"John Kim","affiliation":["CS Department, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311384600"},{"name":"Tor M.

This paper explores throughput-effective network-on-chips (NoC) for future manycore accelerators that employ bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) programming models such as CUDA and OpenCL. A hardware optimization is \"throughput-effective\" if it improves parallel application level performance per unit chip area. We evaluate performance of future looking workloads using detailed closed-loop simulations modeling compute nodes, NoC and the DRAM memory system. We start from a mesh design with bisection bandwidth balanced with off-chip demand. Accelerator workloads tend to demand high off-chip memory bandwidth which results in a many-to-few traffic pattern when coupled with expected technology constraints of slow growth in pins-per-chip. Leveraging these observations we reduce NoC area by proposing a \"checkerboard\" NoC which alternates between conventional full-routers and half-routers with limited connectivity. Checkerboard employs a new oblivious routing algorithm that maintains a minimum hop-count for architectures that place L2 cache banks at the half-router nodes. Next, we show that increasing network injection bandwidth for the large amount of read reply traffic at the nodes connected to DRAM controllers alleviates a significant fraction of the remaining imbalance resulting from the many-to-few traffic pattern. The combined effect of the above optimizations with an improved placement of memory controllers in the mesh and channel slicing improves application throughput per unit area by 25.4%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692847/5695520/05695555.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"2010 43rd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2010.50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2010.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-Effective On-Chip Networks for Manycore Accelerators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Throughput","Computational modeling","Instruction sets","Benchmark testing","Computer architecture","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","circuit simulation","multiprocessing systems","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network routing","network-on-chip","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manycore compute accelerator","on-chip interconnection network design","throughput-effective network-on-chip","throughput-effective NoC","bulk-synchronous parallel programming model","BSP programming model","hardware optimization","closed-loop simulation","DRAM memory system","off-chip memory bandwidth","pins-per-chip","checkerboard NoC","routing algorithm","L2 cache banks","network injection bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NoC","Compute accelerator","GPGPU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-Effective On-Chip Networks for Manycore Accelerators","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11771980","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-Effective On-Chip Networks for Manycore Accelerators","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4299a421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102938S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692847","isNumber":"5695520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692847","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5695520","articleId":"5695555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695595,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Korch","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Korch","id":"37281843300"},{"name":"Thomas Rauber","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Rauber","id":"37281781200"},{"name":"Carsten Scholtes","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Scholtes","id":"37705689300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9727-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4307-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"},{"format":"CD","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"5695595","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Synchronization","Extrapolation","Pipeline processing","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","extrapolation","parallel algorithms","resource allocation","shared memory systems","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed-parallel implementation","reduced synchronization overhead","large shared-memory computers","extrapolation method","one-step method","ordinary differential equations","shared memory computer systems","data parallelism","task parallelism","load balancing","loop structures","ODE systems","synchronization costs","memory references","SGI Altix 4700"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel extrapolation methods","ODE","shared memory","POSIX Threads","NUMA","locality","scalability"]}],"abstract":"Extrapolation methods belong to the class of one-step methods for the solution of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

However, the cost of NAND flash memory is still high to substitute for hard disk entirely. Using hard disk and NAND flash memory together as secondary storage is an alternative solution to provide relatively low response time, large capacity, and reasonable cost. In this paper, we present a new buffer cache management scheme with data migration that is optimized to use both NAND flash memory and hard disk together as secondary storage. The proposed scheme has three salient features. First, it detects I/O access patterns from each storage, and allocates the buffer cache space for each pattern by computing marginal gain adaptively considering the I/O cost of storage. Second, it prefetches data selectively according to their access pattern and storage devices. Third, it moves the evicted data from the buffer cache to hard disk or NAND flash memory considering the access patterns of block references on the reclamation. Trace-driven simulations show that the proposed scheme improves the I/O performance significantly. It enhances the buffer cache hit ratio by up to 29.9% and reduces the total I/O elapsed time by up to 49.5% compared to the well-acknowledged UBM scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unifying Buffer Replacement and Prefetching with Data Migration for Heterogeneous Storage Devices","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2010.103","startPage":"330","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2010.103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695578","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692856/5695578/05695620.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Unifying Buffer Replacement and Prefetching with Data Migration for Heterogeneous Storage Devices","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695620/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772250","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unifying Buffer Replacement and Prefetching with Data Migration for Heterogeneous Storage Devices","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4307a330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05337S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692856","isNumber":"5695578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692856","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5695578","articleId":"5695620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5695638,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Benoit","affiliation":["LIP, ENS Lyon, CNRS-ENS Lyon-UCB Lyon-INRIA, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Benoit","id":"37408200000"},{"name":"Hinde Bouziane","affiliation":["LIP, ENS Lyon, CNRS-ENS Lyon-UCB Lyon-INRIA, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Hinde","lastName":"Bouziane","id":"37540951600"},{"name":"Yves Robert","affiliation":["LIP, ENS Lyon, CNRS-ENS Lyon-UCB Lyon-INRIA, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Robert","id":"37283850600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9727-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4307-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"},{"format":"CD","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"5695638","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Reliability","Bandwidth","Silicon","Pipelines","Complexity theory","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interval mappings","streaming applications","pipelined application mapping","heterogeneous platforms","bi-criteria problem","communication network capabilities","NP-complete problem","polynomial bounds","bi-criteria mapping problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pipelined applications","general mapping","interval mapping","throughput","reliability","heterogeneous platforms","bi-criteria optimization","complexity","heuristics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695638","abstract":"This paper deals with the problem of mapping pipelined applications on heterogeneous platforms whose processors are subject to failures. We address a difficult bi-criteria problem, namely deciding which stages to replicate, and on which resources, in order to optimize the reliability of the schedule, while guaranteeing a minimal throughput. Previous work had addressed the complexity of interval mappings, where the application is partitioned into intervals of consecutive stages (which are then replicated and assigned to processors). In this paper we investigate general mappings, where stages may be partitioned without any constraint, thereby allowing a better usage of processors and communication network capabilities. The price to pay for general mappings is a dramatic increase in the problem complexity. We show that computing the period of a given general mapping is an NP-complete problem, and we provide polynomial bounds to determine a (conservative) approximated value. The bi-criteria mapping problem itself becomes NP-complete on homogeneous platforms, while it is polynomial with interval mappings. We design a set of efficient heuristics, which we compare with interval mapping strategies through extensive simulations.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"476","endPage":"483","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2010.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2010.15","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692856/5695578/05695638.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General vs. Interval Mappings for Streaming Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695638/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"General vs. Interval Mappings for Streaming Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772264","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695638/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General vs. Interval Mappings for Streaming Applications","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4307a476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066664S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692856","isNumber":"5695578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692856","xplore-issue":"5695578","articleId":"5695638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5695642,"authors":[{"name":"Qishi Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Qishi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290357300"},{"name":"Yi Gu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Gu","id":"37399837700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9727-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4307-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"},{"format":"CD","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"5695642","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Workflow Mapping Algorithm for Minimum End-to-End Delay under Fault-Tolerance Constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695642","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Computer networks","Delay","Complexity theory","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","fault tolerant computing","optimisation","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed workflow mapping algorithm","minimum end-to-end delay","fault-tolerance constraint","large-scale scientific applications","distributed computing workflows","complex structures","shared wide-area networks","faulty network environments","eScience","optimization problem","distributed heuristic mapping solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed algorithm","end-to-end delay","scientific workflow","fault tolerance"]}],"abstract":"Many large-scale scientific applications feature distributed computing workflows of complex structures that must be executed and transferred in shared wide-area networks consisting of unreliable nodes and links.

We construct analytical cost models and formulate workflow mapping as an optimization problem under failure rate constraint. We propose a distributed heuristic mapping solution based on recursive critical path to achieve minimum end-to-end delay and satisfy a pre-specified overall failure rate for a guaranteed level of fault tolerance. The performance superiority of the proposed mapping solution is illustrated by extensive simulation-based comparisons with existing mapping algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2010.38","startPage":"508","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692856/5695578/05695642.pdf","endPage":"515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2010.38","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695642/","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Workflow Mapping Algorithm for Minimum End-to-End Delay under Fault-Tolerance Constraint","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5695642/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11772161","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Workflow Mapping Algorithm for Minimum End-to-End Delay under Fault-Tolerance Constraint","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4307a508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092411S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692856","isNumber":"5695578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692856","xplore-issue":"5695578","articleId":"5695642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5695661,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information Processing & Human-Robot Systems, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537668200"},{"name":"Xuemei Guo","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information Processing & Human-Robot Systems, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37406274300"},{"name":"Min Liu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information Processing & Human-Robot Systems, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289817800"},{"name":"Guoli Wang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information Processing & Human-Robot Systems, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Guoli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37278828800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9727-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4307-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"},{"format":"CD","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"5695661","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tracking","Detectors","Bayesian methods","Mathematical model","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image motion analysis","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion tracking","Bayesian filtering","Boolean compressive infrared sampling","measurement transformation method","functional vector quantizer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion tracking","boolean compressive infrared sampling","functional quantizer","vector quantization","Bayesian filtering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695661","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2010.126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2010.126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695578","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692856/5695578/05695661.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Tracking Based on Boolean Compressive Infrared Sampling","abstract":"This paper concerns the issue of motion tracking with Bayesian filtering driven by boolean compressive infrared sampling.

The system is reconfigurable in hardware and software in the sense that certain components may be reused in different applications; hence allowing rapid development of embedded control systems. Concurrent real-time operation can be achieved by utilizing hardware and software modules consisting of dedicated hardware cores and real-time operating systems. For demonstration purposes we discuss development of a system consisting of a network-enabled master processor that handles two slave processors each controlling a mechatronic system. The user interface is implemented using an internet browser through the master processor which allows monitoring and supervisory control of the individual systems. A multi-threaded Real-time Operating System (RTOS) runs on each of the softcore processors which allows flexibility and modularity in software design while pre-designed hardware modules on the FPGA chip can be utilized to build computing hardware for control applications in Mechatronics. Experimental results are presented to illustrate how control applications can be developed and deployed using modular components and the hardware/software environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685170/5695712/05695754.pdf","startPage":"1356","endPage":"1361","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2010.5695754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2010.5695754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using FPGA-based platforms for embedded control applications in Mechatronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Software","Multiprocessing systems","Pulse width modulation","Control systems","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","mechatronics","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based platform","embedded control","mechatronic system","reconfigurable multiprocessor system","field programmable gate array","network-enabled master processor","multithreaded real-time operating system","RTOS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded Controllers","Distributed Control","Multiprocessor Systems","System on a Programmable Chip (SoPC)","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Using FPGA-based platforms for embedded control applications in Mechatronics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695754/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11763047","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using FPGA-based platforms for embedded control applications in Mechatronics","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069699S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685170","isNumber":"5695712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685170","xplore-issue":"5695712","articleId":"5695754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695787,"authors":[{"name":"Fayi Luo","affiliation":["Intelligent Control Laboratory, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fayi","lastName":"Luo","id":"38002801200"},{"name":"Guangming Xie","affiliation":["Intelligent Control Laboratory, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Xie","id":"37270592800"},{"name":"Qining Wang","affiliation":["Intelligent Control Laboratory, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qining","lastName":"Wang","id":"37577407400"},{"name":"Long Wang","affiliation":["Intelligent Control Laboratory, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280759400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8032-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8031-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8030-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"5695787","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695787","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Leg","Robot kinematics","Trajectory","Servomotors","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["legged locomotion","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","five-bar mechanism","quadruped amphibious robot","flipper-leg","terrestrial gaits","swimming gaits","leg system","leg trajectory"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the development and gait analysis of a quadruped amphibious robot.

The control strategy achieves accurate tracking by making use of artificial neural network (ANN) learning capabilities to approximate the machine's nonlinear dynamics. The ANN controller's output is then fed to a Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) to produce duty cycles for the inverter. On the other hand, a second ANN is used as an observer to estimate rotor speed and the rotor position is obtained by direct integration to reduce the effect of the system's noise. Unlike other sensorless control strategies, no a priori offline training, weights initialization, voltage transducer or mechanical parameters knowledge is required.

One analyzes an environment's scenery by matching the inputs with imaginary database to find the optimum result. The other uses fiduciary markers. In proposed method, the system uses fiduciary markers with a capital alphabet in it. When the known size fiduciary marker is captured by a camera, by using homography transformation, the 6-DOF camera pose with respect to the marker's local coordinate can be calculated. To recognize the character in the marker, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with back-propagation training method is used. 12 unique features of a character are defined and used as inputs of ANN. Since more than 95% recognition rate is achieved in testing phase, the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with ANN could be used as a marker detection method. The localization experimental result with the fiduciary marker shows that the proposed method could be a solution for indoor localization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695801/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11762900","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695801/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fiducial marker indoor localization with Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiducial marker indoor localization with Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075294S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685170","isNumber":"5695712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685170","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5695712","articleId":"5695801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5695828,"authors":[{"name":"Michael R.

A switching-based control scheme is developed that enables damping control within the limb's regenerative region of operation. This control approach allows the limb to realize bounded mechanical dissipation using a strictly passive means, while at the same time generating electrical power to augment the limb's power requirements in active modes of operation. Experimental characterizations of the performance and regenerative efficiency of the switching-based controller indicate that the passive switching controller can provide damping modulation, but at the expense of decreased efficiencies of regeneration as compared to the theoretical projections of the actuator model.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2010.5695828","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685170/5695712/05695828.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2010.5695828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanical damping with electrical regeneration for a powered transfemoral prosthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695828/","displayDocTitle":"Mechanical damping with electrical regeneration for a powered transfemoral prosthesis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11769905","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695828/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanical damping with electrical regeneration for a powered transfemoral prosthesis","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097538S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685170","isNumber":"5695712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685170","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5695712","articleId":"5695828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5695870,"authors":[{"name":"Hicham Chaoui","affiliation":["Industrial Electronics Research Group, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, QUE, Canada","\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Hicham","lastName":"Chaoui","id":"37273376100"},{"name":"Pierre Sicard","affiliation":["Industrial Electronics Research Group, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Sicard","id":"37275732300"},{"name":"Herv\u00e9 Jo\u00ebl Nanga Ndjana","affiliation":["Industrial Electronics Research Group, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Herv\u00e9 Jo\u00ebl Nanga","lastName":"Ndjana","id":"37564596000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8032-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8031-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8030-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"5695870","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive state of charge (SOC) estimation for batteries with parametric uncertainties","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an adaptive state of charge (SOC) estimator for batteries.

The traditional spectrum sensing technology is to detect that a band of frequencies is occupied or not by the primary user of that band at the appointment time and location. However, with multi-antenna technologies, e.g. beamforming, multiple users can be multiplexed into the same channel at the same time in same geographical areas. In this paper, an angle dimension is introduced into the detection algorithm as a new spectrum opportunity. The Ratio of maximum to minimum eigenvalue (MME) detector is applied to detect the presence of primary signal, and then the MUSIC algorithm is involved into the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of the primary signal. It is obviously demonstrated by the simulation results that the proposed method has the more spectrum sensing opportunities without interference to the primary user.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685179/5695954/05695980.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695954","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","startPage":"39","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing based on estimation of direction of arrival","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing based on estimation of direction of arrival","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695980/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695980/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763294","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing based on estimation of direction of arrival","confLoc":"Li Jiang, China","sourcePdf":"A152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081218S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685179","isNumber":"5695954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685179","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5695954","articleId":"5695980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Memetic Computing Society","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":5695987,"authors":[{"name":"Xinhua Yu","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xinhua Yu","id":"37600331600"},{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311070800"},{"name":"Haogang Wang","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599282300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8654-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5695987","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mutual coupling","Transmission line matrix methods","Antenna arrays","Arrays","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","genetic algorithms","Green's function methods","indoor radio","interpolation","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","receiving antennas","telecommunication transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor MIMO","matching network","nolinear optimization method","mutual coupling","transmitters","transmission lines","receiver antennas","Green's function","interpolation","channel capacity","genetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In our recent research, we study a novel matching network by using nolinear optimization method for excellent capacity performance of MIMO system. Most of the matching methods in previous research neglect the mutual coupling (MC) effects. In this paper, we focus on a new multi-port matching network synthesis method that not only takes account of the mutual coupling of antennas on the transmitters/receivers but also the coupling between the transmission lines that connect the receiver antennas and the loads. In this novel synthesis method, we 1) build a rigorous analysis model of the MIMO channel with a matching network by using the MultiLevel Green's Function Interpolation Method+Geometric Optical method (MLGFIM+GO) recently developed by ourselves that can be used to handle the mutual coupling of the antennas systems efficiently, and second set the capacity as the target functions and 2) employ the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the matching network. Here, we simulate the capacity of a 2\u00d72 array with matching networks considering MC. The numerical results in this paper demonstrate that the designed matching network can gain higher MIMO channel capacity than the matching network without considering the MC.","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685179/5695954/05695987.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching network optimization for indoor MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5695987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5695987/","displayDocTitle":"Matching network optimization for indoor MIMO","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763301","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5695987/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching network optimization for indoor MIMO","confLoc":"Li Jiang, China","sourcePdf":"A2245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050084S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685179","isNumber":"5695954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685179","xplore-issue":"5695954","articleId":"5695987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Memetic Computing Society","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5696002,"authors":[{"name":"You-qi Li","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Technology, Huludao, Liaoning, China","Liaoning Technical University, Huludao, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"You-qi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085947362"},{"name":"Jing-chang Nan","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Technology, Huludao, Liaoning, China","Liaoning Technical University, Huludao, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Jing-chang","lastName":"Nan","id":"37529829200"},{"name":"Jiu-chao Li","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Technology, Huludao, Liaoning, China","Liaoning Technical University, Huludao, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Jiu-chao","lastName":"Li","id":"37538141900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8654-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696002","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1337},"abstract":"In order to solve the conflict between the efficiency and the linearity of a power amplifier in the base station, the Doherty structure is adopted to design the power amplifier in this paper. The problem is successfully solved in Agilent's ADS design platform by incorporating with the load-pull technology. A single amplifier, a balanced amplifier and a Doherty amplifier are designed in this work, which are used in the base station driver amplifier in the 920MHz-960MHz frequency band. The power-added efficiency of the Doherty amplifier can reach 48.9% when the peak output power backs off 6dB, with increase of 14.6% compared with the balanced amplifier. Besides, the third-order inter-modulation distortion is below -30dBc with the improvement of 4.9dB as well. The Doherty power amplifier is proved to have higher efficiency and good linearity from the simulation experiment, thus the structure can be well applied to the design of RF power amplifiers, which has an important reference value for PA designers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Linearity","Base stations","Impedance","Power generation","Microwave communication","Microwave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","circuit simulation","driver circuits","network synthesis","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doherty power amplifier","base station","Doherty structure","Agilent ADS design platform","load-pull technology","single amplifier","base station driver amplifier","balanced amplifier","third-order intermodulation distortion","RF power amplifiers","PA designers","frequency 920 MHz to 960 MHz"]}],"publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685179/5695954/05696002.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and simulation of a Doherty power amplifier for the base station","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and simulation of a Doherty power amplifier for the base station","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696002/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696002/","accessionNumber":"11763316","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and simulation of a Doherty power amplifier for the base station","confLoc":"Li Jiang, China","sourcePdf":"A3237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04059S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685179","isNumber":"5695954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685179","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5695954","articleId":"5696002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Memetic Computing Society","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5696010,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Guang","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Liang Guang","id":"37581144100"},{"name":"Gong Wenbin","affiliation":["Shanghai Engineering Center of Microsatellites, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Gong Wenbin","id":"37642635300"},{"name":"Jia Boqi","affiliation":["Shanghai Engineering Center of Microsatellites, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jia Boqi","id":"37991243200"},{"name":"Liu Huijie","affiliation":["Shanghai Engineering Center of Microsatellites, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Liu Huijie","id":"37398624100"},{"name":"Yu Jinpei","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Yu Jinpei","id":"37645164800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8654-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696010","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":597},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","genetic algorithms","mobile satellite communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital beamforming","transmitter antenna array","mobile satellite communication","pattern synthesis","genetic algorithm","DBF"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of a digital beamforming (DBF) transmitter array with 16 beams","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695954","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685179/5695954/05696010.pdf","startPage":"82","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696010","abstract":"A 61-channel digital beamforming transmitter array antenna for the mobile satellite communication application is presented in this paper, which can form sixteen beams simultaneously.

OD traffic anomalies in a network are investigated in this paper, using statistical analysis based on principle component analysis (PCA). Firstly, we use PCA method to analyze network traffic characteristics and to divide OD flows in the network into both normal and abnormal subspace. Then in abnormal subspace, OD flows are grouped according to common destination address. At the same time, we compute statistical correlations between OD flows in each group and detect traffic anomaly behavior. Finally, we exploit traffic data from a real network to validate our method. Simulation results show that our approach can effectively and accurately detect OD traffic anomalies.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685179/5695954/05696013.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical analysis for origin-destination traffic anomalies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Computer crime","Equations","Principal component analysis","Mathematical model","Simulation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component analysis","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","origin-destination traffic anomalies","principle component analysis","PCA method","network traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis for origin-destination traffic anomalies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696013/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763326","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis for origin-destination traffic anomalies","confLoc":"Li Jiang, China","sourcePdf":"B1281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114079S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685179","isNumber":"5695954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685179","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5695954","articleId":"5696013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Memetic Computing Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5696017,"authors":[{"name":"Xingli Huang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xingli Huang","id":"37087849165"},{"name":"Huaizong Shao","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Huaizong Shao","id":"37087655275"},{"name":"Wei Huang","affiliation":["Military Representative Office Chengdu, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Wei Huang","id":"37087846387"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8654-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696017","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Convergence","Steady-state","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bit error rate","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft decision-directed scheme","cross-QAM system","square-QAM system","constant modulus equalization algorithm","MCMA+MSDD","CMA+SDD","variable step-size","rectangular decision region","convergence speed","steady-state mean square error"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an improved constant modulus equalization algorithm called MCMA+MSDD is proposed based on CMA+SDD.

The PTS scheme can be directly applied to a space-frequency block coding (SFBC) multiple-input multiple-output OFDM (MIMO-OFDM) system, selecting the transmitted sequence with lowest average PAPR over all transmitting antennas. However, the computational complexity increases in proportion to the number of sub-blocks and antennas. In this letter, a novel scheme, called as the polyphase circular shift and conjugate (PCSC), is proposed. The proposed method uses properties of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and employs the character of multiple antennas. Simulation results of the proposed method can provide good performance compared to PTS in the case of the same number of sub-blocks, phase weighting factors and antennas.","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685179/5695954/05696044.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695954","startPage":"108","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction scheme in SFBC MIMO-OFDM based on transformation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction scheme in SFBC MIMO-OFDM based on transformation","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696044/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763356","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5696044/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction scheme in SFBC MIMO-OFDM based on transformation","confLoc":"Li Jiang, China","sourcePdf":"C1161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075048S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685179","isNumber":"5695954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685179","xplore-issue":"5695954","articleId":"5696044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Memetic Computing Society","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5696045,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering of UESTC, Sichuan Chengdu, 611731, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Chun He","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering of UESTC, Sichuan Chengdu, 611731, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Zhu-lin Zong","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology of UESTC, Sichuan Chengdu, 611731, China"],"firstName":"Zhu-lin","lastName":"Zong"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8654-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696045","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel correlation architecture of acquisition for GNSS satellite navigation system receiver based on CORDIC algorithm","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685179/5695954/05696045.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"121","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695954","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Mathematical model","Correlation","Global Navigation Satellite Systems","Equations","Artificial neural networks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","digital arithmetic","digital signal processing chips","fast Fourier transforms","Global Positioning System","multiplying circuits","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation architecture","GNSS satellite navigation system receiver","CORDIC algorithm","key function modules","satellite navigation receiver","GNSS receiver","GPS","GLONASS","Beidou","navigation signals","chip rates","chip frequency","FFT processors","parallel search","signal strength","acquisition module","arbitrary system","GNSS navigation baseband system","twiddle multiplications","CORDIC-based multipliers","hardware multiplier","hardware resource"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GNSS receiver","CORDIC","acquisition","FFT"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696045","abstract":"Acquisition is the key function modules of the baseband system of satellite navigation receiver. In the GNSS receiver for GPS, GLONASS and Beidou, in order to acquire the three navigation signals at different chip rates and frequency, three FFT processors are needed when using the parallel search based on FFT. GNSS receiver can choose best navigation system according to the signal strength of different system. Under this background, a novel correlation architecture based on CORDIC algorithm is proposed in this paper. Based on the CORDIC architecture, one common acquisition module configured by different parameters for arbitrary system in the GNSS navigation baseband system is built. While in this architecture, the twiddle multiplications are performed by CORDIC-based multipliers, avoids the hardware multiplier which always occupies a lot of hardware resource. The experiment results show that the proposed correlation architecture can greatly reduce the power, hardware resource and consumption while keeping the fast acquisition. It is attractive for the GNSS navigation receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763358","htmlLink":"/document/5696045/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel correlation architecture of acquisition for GNSS satellite navigation system receiver based on CORDIC algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel correlation architecture of acquisition for GNSS satellite navigation system receiver based on CORDIC algorithm","confLoc":"Li Jiang, China","sourcePdf":"C1165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042185S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685179","isNumber":"5695954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685179","xplore-issue":"5695954","articleId":"5696045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Memetic Computing Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5696051,"authors":[{"name":"Dingde Jiang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, NEU, Shenyang, China","State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dingde Jiang","id":"37653012100"},{"name":"Yang Han","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, NEU, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yang Han","id":"38009454700"},{"name":"Xingwei Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, NEU, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Xingwei Wang","id":"37293609500"},{"name":"Zhengzheng Xu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, NEU, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Zhengzheng Xu","id":"37710501900"},{"name":"Hongwei Xu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, NEU, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Hongwei Xu","id":"37714034300"},{"name":"Zhenhua Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, NEU, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Zhenhua Chen","id":"37714689700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8654-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-981-08-6322-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696051","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Computer crime","Time frequency analysis","Equations","Mathematical model","Computers","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network management","telecommunication traffic","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency detecting method","network traffic anomalies","network fault","network attack","origin-destination flows","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network traffic","anomaly detecting","time-frequency analysis","origin-destination flow","correlation coefficient"]}],"abstract":"Traffic anomalies are abnormal changes in network traffic.

We then make time-frequency analysis for each group and extract their high frequency component. Based on the extracted high frequency signal, correlation coefficients of each OD flow against the other in a group are computed. Consequently, we can make the exact anomaly detection.

High performance hardware implementations of RSA and ECC systems use the Montgomery algorithm for modular multiplication, since it allows results to be obtained without performing the division operation. The aim of this article is to explore various modified structures of the Montgomery algorithm for high speed implementation. We present the implementation of a modified Montgomery algorithm with CSA and with different radix. In order to optimize the implementation regarding operation speed, we considered carry save adders structures and the Booth recoding scheme. The structure used in this paper simplifies the computation of the partial products avoiding the use of memories to store pre-calculated data for partial products which cannot be achieved by the shifting operation. The result shows that high-radix implementations are better for high speed applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High radix implementation of Montgomery multipliers with CSA","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2010.5696148","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686267/5696080/05696148.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2010.5696148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"High radix implementation of Montgomery multipliers with CSA","conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696148/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763775","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High radix implementation of Montgomery multipliers with CSA","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"p315teshome.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055543S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686267","isNumber":"5696080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686267","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5696080","articleId":"5696148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5696151,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Ruiz-Amaya","affiliation":["Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla, IMSE-CNM (CSIC), Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"Ruiz-Amaya","id":"38272388200"},{"name":"Alberto Rodr\u00edguez-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla, IMSE-CNM (CSIC), Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Rodr\u00edguez-P\u00e9rez","id":"38335204500"},{"name":"Manuel Delgado-Restituto","affiliation":["Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla, IMSE-CNM (CSIC), Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Delgado-Restituto","id":"38494053600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-151-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-149-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-150-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"5696151","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"abstract":"This paper presents a comparative study of three low-noise amplifiers for neural recording applications.

We show that the replica cell biasing scheme can achieve 85.9% reduction in leakage current with an estimated gate area overhead of 2.3% plus area of polysilicon resistors (per memory instance) together with a speed reduction of 34.5% under most leaking conditions.

Major contributors to the reliability issues of MOSFET devices include negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in p-type MOSFET. NBTI phenomena causes threshold voltage shift (increasing Vt) of pMOS devices over time. This results in slow down of devices and loss of performance for logic gates. Vt shift of pMOS due to NBTI compromises SRAM stability and could cause corruption of stored data due to negative effects on Static Noise margin (SNM). It is essential to screen for NBTI effect at production time to eliminate future field failures. Current methods to screen for NBTI are expensive and inconclusive. We propose a design for test approach which enables screening for NBTI with low overhead and less test time.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2010.5696167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2010.5696167","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686267/5696080/05696167.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Effective screening for NBTI effect on SRAM-based memory","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763793","htmlLink":"/document/5696167/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective screening for NBTI effect on SRAM-based memory","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"p383mohammad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058139S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686267","isNumber":"5696080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686267","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5696080","articleId":"5696167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5696169,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Senning","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Senning","id":"37887789400"},{"name":"Andreas Staudacher","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Staudacher","id":"37991308900"},{"name":"Andreas Burg","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Burg","id":"37268709200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-151-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-149-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-150-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"5696169","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696169","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Detectors","Microprocessors","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","IEEE 802.11n Standard","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","fast Fourier transforms","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","systolic arrays","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined systolic-array architecture","regularized QR-decomposition","IEEE 802.11n","soft-MMSE detection","packet-based MIMO-OFDM transmission","channel-matrix preprocessing","soft-output MMSE detector","FFT","CMOS technology","size 0.13 micron"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696080","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2010.5696169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systolic-array based regularized QR-decomposition for IEEE 802.11n compliant soft-MMSE detection","startPage":"391","endPage":"394","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686267/5696080/05696169.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2010.5696169","abstract":"This paper considers the implementation of a soft-output MMSE detector for packet-based MIMO-OFDM transmission.

Arithmetic-intensive applications often contain large portion of datapath circuits. Datapath circuits usually contain hard-blocks (e.g. multipliers, adders, memories etc) that are connected together by regularly structured signals called buses. Conventional FPGAs do not use the regularity of datapath circuits. So it is possible to modify the conventional FPGA architectures to exploit the regularity of datapath circuits and achieve significant area savings. This paper describes a new tree-based FPGA architecture that uses bus-based connections and exploits the regularity of datapath circuits to achieve area savings. Experiments show that the proposed architecture is 24%, 21% more area efficient than conventional mesh-based and tree-based architectures respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new datapath-oriented tree-based FPGA architecture","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2010.5696172","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686267/5696080/05696172.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2010.5696172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new datapath-oriented tree-based FPGA architecture","conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696172/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763797","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new datapath-oriented tree-based FPGA architecture","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"p403farooq.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062852S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686267","isNumber":"5696080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686267","xplore-issue":"5696080","articleId":"5696172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5696173,"authors":[{"name":"Najeh Masmoudi Kamoun","affiliation":["CIRTA'COM, SUP'COM, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Najeh Masmoudi","lastName":"Kamoun","id":"38191710100"},{"name":"Lilian Bossuet","affiliation":["IMS, EINSEIRB, Bordeaux, France"],"firstName":"Lilian","lastName":"Bossuet","id":"37281910400"},{"name":"Adel Ghazel","affiliation":["CIRTA'COM, SUP'COM, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Ghazel","id":"37283433500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-151-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-149-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-150-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"5696173","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Field programmable gate arrays","Electrical resistance measurement","Helium","Immune system","Noise measurement","Oscilloscopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["experimental implementation","2ODPA attacks","AES design","flash-based FPGA technology","experimental second order differential power analysis","advanced encryption standard hardware implementation","AES hardware implementation","improved product combining function","FPGA board critical AES modules","experimental second order DPA attack"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","Second order DPA","Combining function","masking schemes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696173","abstract":"A successful experimental second order Differential Power Analysis (DPA) on an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) hardware implementation on flash-based FPGA technology with improved product combining function is achieved.

The second changes the key using a pseudorandom number generator. Using time-variable key technique enhances the security of DES because the same plaintext is ciphered to different cipher texts by time. Hackers will face difficulty to hack into the proposed schemes because of time-variant behavior. Final 16-stage pipelined design of the two proposed schemes is implemented on Xilinx Spartan-3e Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The 16-stage pipelined design of the first scheme is achieved with encryption rate of 7.97 Gbit/s and 2697 number of Configurable logic blocks (CLBs). The second operates at data rates up to 7.26 Gbit/s and 2566 CLBs.

On the other hand, commercial microcontrollers run at slower speed compared to the high data-rate of the image sensors and many embedded system applications need random access of the pixel values. Besides, commercial microcontrollers do not have sufficient internal memory to store a complete image. In this paper, the design of a novel bridge is proposed to interface high speed image sensors in low power and low speed embedded systems. By using the proposed bridge, the image processor or microcontroller can capture and store an image in the bridge's internal memory. The pixel values can then be accessed in a random fashion through a parallel memory access interface at the desired speed. The bridge can be used in different embedded system applications such as pattern recognition, robotic vision, bio-medical imaging etc.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards design of a bridge to enable high speed image sensors for random access","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2010.5696180","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686267/5696080/05696180.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2010.5696180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Towards design of a bridge to enable high speed image sensors for random access","conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696180/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763804","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards design of a bridge to enable high speed image sensors for random access","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"p431khan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05786S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686267","isNumber":"5696080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686267","xplore-issue":"5696080","articleId":"5696180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5696186,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The architecture is composed of a library of components that can be used to perform several image processing and vision tasks. Components can be organized in one or more processing pipelines. A full frame or part of the frame can be buffered during the process to allow region-based operations that are commonly used in various vision algorithms. The functionality of the architecture is verified by implementing an algorithm for detecting ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse. The algorithm is implemented using both Matlab and the proposed architecture. An image set composed of 1511 images captured using the proposed architecture is used for testing. The results show that hardware implementation using the proposed architecture introduces a comparable accuracy with a very significant savings in processing time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686267/5696080/05696187.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"458","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microelectronics","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2010.5696187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2010.5696187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable architecture for real-time vision systems on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Software","Field programmable gate arrays","Image resolution","Hardware","Variable speed drives","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","pipeline processing","real-time systems","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable architecture","real-time vision systems","FPGA","image processing","vision tasks","processing pipelines","region-based operations","vision algorithms","hardware implementation","comparable accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable architecture for real-time vision systems on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696187/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763808","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable architecture for real-time vision systems on FPGA","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"p455elhossini.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06435S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686267","isNumber":"5696080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686267","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5696080","articleId":"5696187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5696188,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Bahoura","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Quebec, Rimouski, Rimouski, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Bahoura","id":"37267277600"},{"name":"Hassan Ezzaidi","affiliation":["Department of Applied Sciences, University of Quebec, Chicoutimi, Chicoutimi, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Ezzaidi","id":"37395174100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-151-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-149-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-150-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"5696188","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Computer architecture","Helium","Discrete wavelet transforms","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transform implementation","FPGA","pipelined real-time architecture","forward wavelet transforms","inverse wavelet transforms","filter group delays","reconstruction error","Xilinx system generator","XUP Virtex-II pro development board"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a pipelined real-time architecture for forward/inverse wavelet transforms that take into account the filter group delays.

This paper proposes an improved particle swarm optimization utilizing Iterative Chaotic Map with Infinite Collapses (ICMIC) perturbations (ICMICPSO) for shortest path computation in computer networks. The chaotic perturbation generated by the ICMIC is incorporated into the particle's velocity updating rule to make the particles have a larger potential space to fly. With the coefficient of chaotic perturbation decaying, the dynamics of ICMICPSO algorithm is a chaotic dynamics first and then a steepest descent dynamics. The proposed ICMICPSO method as hybrid optimization is tested on several network topologies. Numerical results are compared with that of some other Chaotic PSO methods available in the usual literature. The performance studies demonstrate that the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ICMICPSO approach are comparably to or better than that of the other CPSO variants in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2010.45","startPage":"179","endPage":"183","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2010.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696218","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692951/5696218/05696258.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Particle Swarm Optimization with Decaying ICMIC for Shortest Path Computation in Computer Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696258/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Particle Swarm Optimization with Decaying ICMIC for Shortest Path Computation in Computer Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696258/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11772362","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Particle Swarm Optimization with Decaying ICMIC for Shortest Path Computation in Computer Networks","confLoc":"Nanning, China","sourcePdf":"4297a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081664S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692951","isNumber":"5696218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692951","xplore-issue":"5696218","articleId":"5696258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5696259,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangjun Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Management, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China","Faculty of Information and Communication Technologies, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhangjun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37655127700"},{"name":"Zhiwei Ni","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Management, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Ni","id":"37550270500"},{"name":"Lichuan Gu","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Management, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Lichuan","lastName":"Gu","id":"37529669800"},{"name":"Xiao Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technologies, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406542800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9114-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4297-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696259","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":129,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1577},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Processor scheduling","Scheduling","Cloud computing","Optimal scheduling","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","grid computing","particle swarm optimisation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud workflow scheduling","distributed applications","grid environment","data transfer","market-oriented business model","revised discrete particle swarm optimization","data transmission cost","computation cost","cloud price model","best resource selection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["discrete particle swarm optimization","workflow scheduling","cloud computing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIS.2010.46","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2010.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696218","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692951/5696218/05696259.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Revised Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization for Cloud Workflow Scheduling","abstract":"A cloud workflow system is a type of platform service which facilitates the automation of distributed applications based on the novel cloud infrastructure. Compared with grid environment, data transfer is a big overhead for cloud workflows due to the market-oriented business model in the cloud environments. In this paper, a Revised Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (RDPSO) is proposed to schedule applications among cloud services that takes both data transmission cost and computation cost into account. Experiment is conducted with a set of workflow applications by varying their data communication costs and computation costs according to a cloud price model. Comparison is made on make span and cost optimization ratio and the cost savings with RDPSO, the standard PSO and BRS (Best Resource Selection) algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed RDPSO algorithm can achieve much more cost savings and better performance on make span and cost optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772364","htmlLink":"/document/5696259/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Revised Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization for Cloud Workflow Scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Revised Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization for Cloud Workflow Scheduling","confLoc":"Nanning, China","sourcePdf":"4297a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065362S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692951","isNumber":"5696218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692951","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"5696218","articleId":"5696259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5696263,"authors":[{"name":"Changyou Liu","affiliation":["Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Changyou","lastName":"Liu","id":"37716489900"},{"name":"Kaifeng Guo","affiliation":["Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Kaifeng","lastName":"Guo","id":"38014484100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9114-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4297-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696263","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Airports","Optimization","Biological cells","Trajectory","Encoding","Air traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airports","avionics","genetic algorithms","road traffic","safety","scheduling","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airport taxi scheduling optimization","genetic algorithm","civil aviation transportation","airport surface traffic system","genetic encoding method","aircraft safe taxiing problem","conflict restriction","Chengdu Shuangliu airport"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["aircraft taxiing optimization","safety constraints","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIS.2010.50","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692951/5696218/05696263.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2010.50","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Airport Taxi Scheduling Optimization Based on Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"The increasing development of civil aviation transportation has caused serious congestion, which often results in low efficiency and potential risks of airport surface traffic system.

To cope with these concerns, several privacy preserving methodologies have been proposed, classified in two categories, methodologies that aim at protecting the sensitive data and those that aim at protecting the mining results. In our work, we focus on sensitive data protection and compare existing techniques according to their anonymity degree achieved, the information loss suffered and their performance characteristics. The l-diversity principle is combined with k-anonymity concepts, so that background information can not be exploited to successfully attack the privacy of data subjects data refer to. Based on Kohonen Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOMs), we firstly organize data sets in subspaces according to their information theoretical distance to each other, then create the most relevant classes paying special attention to rare sensitive attribute values, and finally generalize attribute values to the minimum extend required so that both the data disclosure probability and the information loss are possibly kept negligible. Furthermore, we propose information theoretical measures for assessing the anonymity degree achieved and empirical tests to demonstrate it.","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2010.93","startPage":"401","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2010.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696218","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692951/5696218/05696308.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Clustering Based Algorithm for Privacy Preserving Data Mining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696308/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Clustering Based Algorithm for Privacy Preserving Data Mining","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696308/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11772402","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Clustering Based Algorithm for Privacy Preserving Data Mining","confLoc":"Nanning, China","sourcePdf":"4297a401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100455S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5692951","isNumber":"5696218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692951","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5696218","articleId":"5696308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5696326,"authors":[{"name":"Hongning Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Networks and Information Security of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongning","lastName":"Li","id":"38009785600"},{"name":"Qingqi Pei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Networks and Information Security of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qingqi","lastName":"Pei","id":"37294380000"},{"name":"Xiaohong Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Networks and Information Security of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37277313600"},{"name":"Rui Liang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Networks and Information Security of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Liang","id":"38013481000"},{"name":"Peng Geng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Networks and Information Security of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Geng","id":"37684277400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9114-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4297-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696326","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696326","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Security","Reliability","Energy consumption","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy consumption","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive radio networks","energy consumption","data fusion","spectrum allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","data fusion","reputation","band division"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIS.2010.110","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692951/5696218/05696326.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2010.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sub-spectrum Sensing Scheme Based on Reputation in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"With the existing Cognitive Radio Networks development, we present a sub-spectrum sensing scheme based on reputation, which takes advantage in energy consumption, security and fairness from spectrum sensing, data fusion and spectrum allocation by classifying users and spectrum bands reasonably.

In the signal stretching process, high resolution target echo can be acquired through second sample for the coarse-resolution range profile. Based on the sparsity of the signal in the spectrogram, we can construct a reasonable partial fourier sparse basis matrix to realize the sparsity of radar data. Then, the high-resolution range profile information is recovered by using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, and the high resolution target imaging can be gained whose target sidelobe is suppressed efficiently. Finally, the results with simulation data validate the feasibility and superiority of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2010.5696555","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684367/5695145/05696555.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2010.5696555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High resolution radar imaging based on compressed sensing using sparse stepped-frequency signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696555/","displayDocTitle":"High resolution radar imaging based on compressed sensing using sparse stepped-frequency signal","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772908","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696555/","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High resolution radar imaging based on compressed sensing using sparse stepped-frequency signal","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"C16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054693S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684367","isNumber":"5695145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684367","xplore-issue":"5695145","articleId":"5696555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5696567,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wave Scattering and Remote Sensing Information (MoE), Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wei Li","id":"38006864800"},{"name":"Ya-Qiu Jin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wave Scattering and Remote Sensing Information (MoE), Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ya-Qiu Jin","id":"37290209600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6908-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6906-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6907-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5696567","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Variable speed drives","MIMO","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","channel capacity","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","rough surfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","three-dimensional rough surface","Monte Carlo method","Kirchhoff approximation","channel transfer matrix","array geometry","surface parameter","channel capacity","antenna array"]}],"abstract":"Multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) system is a promising technique for B3G/4G development.

The Monte Carlo method is employed to generate randomly rough surface, and the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) is applied to calculation of system scattering and the channel transfer matrix. It shows the dependence of the system capacity upon the array geometry and underlying surface parameters. It is found that the channel capacity significantly related with the inter-element separation of the antenna array. When the separation is small, the MIMO capacity due to presence of rough surface can be enhanced.

Firstly, symmetric operator and uniform splitting are adopted to split the matrix derived from the classical Maxwell's equations into four sub-matrices. Simultaneously, two controlling parameters are introduced to decrease the numerical dispersion error. Accordingly, the time step is divided into four sub-steps.

The \u201cworst-case\u201d method can mitigate overmuch computation, but it gives a too conservative prediction. In order to account for these problems, a neural network approach to predict crosstalk in non-uniform cable bundles at low frequencies where circuits are electrically small is proposed. A BP neural network model is trained by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm based on statistical simulation results calculated by RDSI algorithm.

On the other hand, it can be considered as a generalization of the standard partially homogeneous model to the stochastic Bayesian framework, which treats the covariance matrix as a random matrix. According to the stochastic partially homogeneous model, a scale-invariant generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for the adaptive signal detection is developed, which is a knowledge-aided version of the well-known adaptive coherence estimator (ACE). The resulting knowledge-aided ACE (KA-ACE) employs a colored loading step utilizing the a priori knowledge and the sample covariance matrix. Various simulation results and comparison with respect to other detectors confirm the scale-invariance and the effectiveness of the KA-ACE.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5685323/05696739.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2011.2107510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2011.2107510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-Aided Adaptive Coherence Estimator in Stochastic Partially Homogeneous Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Training","Detectors","Stochastic processes","Adaptation model","Signal to noise ratio","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian inference","generalized likelihood ratio test","knowledge-aided","partially homogeneous model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-Aided Adaptive Coherence Estimator in Stochastic Partially Homogeneous Environments","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5696739/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-Aided Adaptive Coherence Estimator in Stochastic Partially Homogeneous Environments","sourcePdf":"lsp-li-2107510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084313S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5685323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5685323","articleId":"5696739","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5696751,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher W.

Four overlapping lines were flown over a forested area in Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Forty-six 0.04-ha plots were systematically established, and commonly derived variables were extracted from first and last returns, including height-related metrics, cover estimates, return intensities, and absolute scan angles. Plot-level metrics from each LiDAR pass were then compared using multivariate repeated-measures analysis-of-variance tests. Results indicate that, while the number of returns was significantly different between the four overlapping flight lines, most LiDAR-derived first return vegetation height metrics were not. First return maximum height and overstory cover, however, were significantly different and varied between flight lines by an average of approximately 2% and 4%, respectively. First return intensities differed significantly between overpasses where sudden changes in the metric occurred without any apparent explanation; intensity should only be used following calibration. With the exception of the standard deviation of height, all second return metrics were significantly different between flight lines. Despite these minor differences, the study demonstrates that, when the LiDAR sensor, settings, and data acquisition flight parameters remain constant, and time-related forest dynamics are not factors, LiDAR-derived metrics of the same location provide stable and repeatable measures of the forest structure, confirming the suitability of LiDAR for forest monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2099232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2099232","startPage":"2385","endPage":"2392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5770377/05696751.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5770377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of Sample-Based Scanning-LiDAR-Derived Vegetation Metrics for Forest Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Stability of Sample-Based Scanning-LiDAR-Derived Vegetation Metrics for Forest Monitoring","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","volume":"49","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696751/","accessionNumber":"12007047","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696751/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of Sample-Based Scanning-LiDAR-Derived Vegetation Metrics for Forest Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bater-2099232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086878S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5770377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5770377","articleId":"5696751","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5696753,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xiang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5767706/5696753/5696753-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Xiang (A'08\u2013M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Deakin University, Victoria, Australia, in 2007.","He is currently with the School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Australia.

It has the capacity to elude the current anomaly-based detection schemes. An information metric can quantify the differences of network traffic with various probability distributions. In this paper, we innovatively propose using two new information metrics such as the generalized entropy metric and the information distance metric to detect low-rate DDoS attacks by measuring the difference between legitimate traffic and attack traffic. The proposed generalized entropy metric can detect attacks several hops earlier (three hops earlier while the order \u03b1 = 10 ) than the traditional Shannon metric. The proposed information distance metric outperforms (six hops earlier while the order \u03b1 = 10) the popular Kullback-Leibler divergence approach as it can clearly enlarge the adjudication distance and then obtain the optimal detection sensitivity. The experimental results show that the proposed information metrics can effectively detect low-rate DDoS attacks and clearly reduce the false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed IP traceback algorithm can find all attacks as well as attackers from their own local area networks (LANs) and discard attack traffic.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2107320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5767706/05696753.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2107320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Rate DDoS Attacks Detection and Traceback by Using New Information Metrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-Rate DDoS Attacks Detection and Traceback by Using New Information Metrics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696753/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11989766","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696753/","volume":"6","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Rate DDoS Attacks Detection and Traceback by Using New Information Metrics","sourcePdf":"tifs-xiang-2107320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129452S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5767706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"205","xplore-issue":"5767706","articleId":"5696753","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5696755,"authors":[{"name":"Hakran Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5876607/5696755/5696755-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hakran Kim received the B.D., M.D., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Sookmyung Womens University, Seoul, Korea, in 1987, 2003, and 2008, respectively.

After interpolating the curvature to the high-resolution image domain, the CIM constructs the high-resolution image by solving a linearized curvature equation, incorporating the interpolated curvature as an explicit driving force. It has been numerically verified that the new zooming method can produce clear images of sharp edges which are already denoised and superior to those obtained from linear methods and PDE-based methods of no curvature information.

By means of the T-S fuzzy model, both a fuzzy fault detection filter system and the dynamics of filtering error generator are constructed. Two finite-frequency performance indices are introduced to measure fault sensitivity and disturbance robustness. Faults are considered in a middle frequency domain, while disturbances are considered in another certain finite-frequency domain interval. By using the generalized Kalman-Yakubovic-Popov Lemma in a local linear system model, the design methods are presented in terms of solutions to a set of linear matrix inequalities, which can be readily solved via standard numerical software. The design problem is formulated as a two-objective optimization algorithm. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the developed techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2099653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5956099/05696767.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2099653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5956099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection for T\u2013S Fuzzy Discrete Systems in Finite-Frequency Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696767/","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection for T\u2013S Fuzzy Discrete Systems in Finite-Frequency Domain","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12157982","pubMedId":"21257383","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696767/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection for T\u2013S Fuzzy Discrete Systems in Finite-Frequency Domain","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-xia-2099653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135501S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5956099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5956099","articleId":"5696767","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5696786,"authors":[{"name":"Junrui Liang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5773659/5696786/5696786-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junrui Liang (S'09\u2013M'10) was born in Guangdong, China, in 1982.

Owning to this extension, the impedances of different circuit components in the Class-E PA circuits, including the active switches, can be expressed in matrix form. Based on the conventional circuit laws, e.g., the series and parallel laws and the Ohm's law, the steady-state characteristics of a whole Class-E PA circuit can be obtained by vector and matrix manipulation. The number of harmonics involved in the calculation have effects on the computational efficiency and accuracy. The influences of some circuit conditions towards the selection of harmonic number are discussed. The proposed formulation enables fast mapping of some performance indices, e.g., the output power and conversion efficiency, under steady state, so that the changing trends of these indices with respect to the variations of specified circuit parameters can be estimated. This feature can be utilized to carry out offline optimization by tuning some passive components, or online optimization by tuning two in situ adjustable parameters, i.e., the switch driving frequency and duty cycle. The later scheme provides preliminary knowledge on the in situ tuning of Class-E PA in the load varying applications, e.g., electric process heating and wireless power link.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5773659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2097671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5773659/05696786.pdf","startPage":"1433","endPage":"1445","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2097671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady-State Simulation and Optimization of Class-E Power Amplifiers With Extended Impedance Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Steady-State Simulation and Optimization of Class-E Power Amplifiers With Extended Impedance Method","volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5696786/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12023251","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady-State Simulation and Optimization of Class-E Power Amplifiers With Extended Impedance Method","sourcePdf":"tcsi-liang-2097671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102255S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5773659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5773659","articleId":"5696786","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5696787,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Chi Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5773659/5696787/5696787-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Chi Wong received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu Taiwan, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.","His research interests include algorithms and VLSI architecture of error correction codes."]},"firstName":"Cheng-Chi","lastName":"Wong","id":"37293014700"},{"name":"Hsie-Chia Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5773659/5696787/5696787-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hsie-Chia Chang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1995, 1997, and 2002, respectively.","From 2002 to 2003, he was with OSP/DE1 in MediaTek Corp., working in the area of decoding architectures for Combo single chip.

We show analytically, by simulations, and with measurements, that commonly used single-tone calibration procedures for diode power probes can provide erroneous values when measuring modulated signals used in many new wireless standards. We show that high values of peak-to-average-power ratio can degrade the calibration results due to the low-frequency response imposed by the power probe's baseband circuit impedance. This effect is first theoretically demonstrated by use of a Volterra series, and then validated by simulations and measurements with a diode power probe circuit. This study provides engineers with guidelines for techniques for correction of diode power probe measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5696790/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11911187","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diode Power Probe Measurements of Wireless Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diode Power Probe Measurements of Wireless Signals","sourcePdf":"tmtt-carvalho-2100405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06384S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5745708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5745708","articleId":"5696790","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5696791,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro M.

When multiple relays are present, the relay with the highest channel gain to the source is the first to successfully decode a packet from the source and forward it to the destination. Thus, the unique properties of rateless codes ensure that both rate adaptation and relay selection occur without the transmitting source or relays acquiring instantaneous channel knowledge. In this paper, we show that in such cooperative systems, buffering packets at relays significantly increases throughput. We develop a novel analysis of these systems that combines the communication-theoretic aspects of cooperation over fading channels with the queuing-theoretic aspects associated with buffering. Closed-form expressions are derived for the throughput and end-to-end delay for the general case in which the channels between various nodes are not statistically identical. Corresponding results are also derived for benchmark systems that either do not exploit spatial diversity or do not buffer packets. Altogether, our results show that buffering - a capability that will be commonly available in practical deployments of relays - amplifies the benefits of cooperation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.011211.091506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5749768/05696846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.011211.091506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5749768","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of a Cooperative System with Rateless Codes and Buffered Relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of a Cooperative System with Rateless Codes and Buffered Relays","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696846/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11944528","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5696846/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of a Cooperative System with Rateless Codes and Buffered Relays","sourcePdf":"1069-tw1104-mehta.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092061S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5749768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5749768","articleId":"5696846","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5696895,"authors":[{"name":"Yawei Yin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, USA"],"lastName":"Yawei Yin"},{"name":"Roberto Proietti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Proietti"},{"name":"Xiaohui Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaohui Ye"},{"name":"S.J.

The result is shown that the algorithm is capable of performing the fault detection as well as arranging the protective relay sequence, with accurate results.","doi":"10.1109/IPECON.2010.5696955","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685176/5696950/05696955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPECON.2010.5696955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696950","startPage":"980","endPage":"983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new directional relay algorithm for the protection of transmission network systems using discrete wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new directional relay algorithm for the protection of transmission network systems using discrete wavelet transforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696955/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770003","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5696955/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new directional relay algorithm for the protection of transmission network systems using discrete wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"FrMP14P0287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100709S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685176","isNumber":"5696950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685176","xplore-issue":"5696950","articleId":"5696955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5696989,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwini Chegu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ashwini Chegu is presently pursuing her M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at The University of Tennessee at Knoxville.

The original PSO algorithm gives an intelligent strategy to search the feasible solution space, but tends to find the best solution only. The proposed method combines the original PSO with tabu search such that a number of top candidates will be identified. This fits the need of high order contingency screening, which can be eventually the input to many other more complicate security analyses. Next, reordering of branches based on the severity of N-1 contingencies is applied as a pre-processing to increase the convergence properties and efficiency of the algorithm. With this reordering approach, many critical high order contingencies are located in a small area in the whole searching space. Therefore, the proposed algorithm tends to concentrate in searching this area such that the number of critical branch combinations searched will increase. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated with N-2 contingency selection using a sample system modified from the original IEEE 118-bus system. Satisfying results are observed.","doi":"10.1109/IPECON.2010.5696989","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1116","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685176/5696950/05696989.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPECON.2010.5696989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High order contingency selection based on particle swarm optimization and branch reordering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Mathematical model","Equations","Load flow","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","power system planning","power system reliability","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high order contingency selection","particle swarm optimization","branch reordering","heuristic searching method","PSO","tabu search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blackouts","high order contingency","N-k contingency","particle swarm optimization","tabu search","branch reordereing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"High order contingency selection based on particle swarm optimization and branch reordering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696989/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763265","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High order contingency selection based on particle swarm optimization and branch reordering","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"FrN13P0471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05343S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685176","isNumber":"5696950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685176","xplore-issue":"5696950","articleId":"5696989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5696995,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan Mulyawan Malik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Irfan Mulyawan","lastName":"Malik","id":"38257891300"},{"name":"Dipti Srinivasan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dipti","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37280047000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7398-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7399-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7397-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1270"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1947-1262"},{"format":"CD","value":"1947-1262"}],"articleNumber":"5696995","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":925},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5696995","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Gallium","Power generation","Fuels","Biological cells","Load flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuel economy","genetic algorithms","industrial power systems","load flow control","load forecasting","mining","power generation control","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum power flow","flexible genetic algorithm model","OPF control variable","generator bus voltage","shunt devices","generator fuel cost parameter","load demand forecast","GA model","standard IEEE 30-bus system","industrial park power system","gold-copper mining power system","Indonesia","power plant engineers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimum power flow","power system optimisation","economic dispatch","genetic algorithm","evolutionary algorithm","computational intelligence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPECON.2010.5696995","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685176/5696950/05696995.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPECON.2010.5696995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum power flow using flexible genetic algorithm model in practical power systems","abstract":"This paper aims at providing a solution to Optimum Power Flow (OPF) in practical power systems by using a flexible genetic algorithm (GA) model. The proposed approach finds the optimal setting of OPF control variables which include generator active power output, generator bus voltages, transformer tap-setting and shunt devices with the objective function of minimising the fuel cost. The proposed GA is modelled to be flexible for implementation to any practical power systems with the given system line, bus data, generator fuel cost parameter and forecasted load demand. The GA model has been analysed and tested on the standard IEEE 30-bus system and two real practical power systems which are an industrial park power system and a gold-copper mining power system both located in Indonesia. These case studies of real power systems have been performed using actual data and the demand pattern. The results obtained outperform other approaches from the literature which was recently applied to the IEEE 30-bus system with the same control variable limits and system data. Better results are also found when compared against the configurations used in the two real power systems which are heuristic based on the practical expertise of power plant engineers. These superior results are achieved due to the robust and reliable algorithm of the proposed GA which utilises the elitism and non-uniform mutation rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5696995/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11763273","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5696995/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimum power flow using flexible genetic algorithm model in practical power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum power flow using flexible genetic algorithm model in practical power systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"FrN32P0476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078947S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685176","isNumber":"5696950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685176","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5696950","articleId":"5696995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5696997,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Bhongade","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"p":["Sandeep Bhongade (b'1974) received M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Mumbai University (India) in 2003.

These hybrid systems require separate dc-dc converters, or at least one dc-dc converter for the supercapacitor bank, to connect them to the dc-link of the grid connecting inverter. However, the use of such dc-dc converters introduces additional cost and power losses. Therefore, the possibility of direct connection of energy storage systems, to the dc-link of a diode clamped 3-level inverter is investigated in this paper. Even though the proposed topology does not use dc-dc converters, a vector selection method is proposed to produce a similar control flexibility that is found in the separate dc-dc converter topology. The major issue with the proposed system is the imminent imbalance of the neutral point potential. A PWM technique with modified carriers is used to solve this problem. Simulations are carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK to verify the efficacy of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696950","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1216","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685176/5696950/05697006.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697006","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Supercapacitors","Inverters","Converters","Discharges","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","secondary cells","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interfacing battery/supercapacitor energy storage systems","distributed energy sources","grid connecting inverter","PWM technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy storage systems interfacing","Hybrid energy storage systems","NPC unbalance","Supercapacitor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new method of interfacing battery/supercapacitor energy storage systems for distributed energy sources","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763283","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5697006/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697006/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method of interfacing battery/supercapacitor energy storage systems for distributed energy sources","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"FrN54P0456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038359S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685176","isNumber":"5696950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685176","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5696950","articleId":"5697006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5697038,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The microgrid is called to be a feasible alternative to solve these issues. As it is a weak electrical grid, the microgrid is very sensitive to load or generation changes. To reduce the effect of these variations and to better harness the energy generated by RES, the Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are used. As the different ESS technologies that are currently available are not enough to satisfy the wide frequency spectrum of the generated energy, the use of a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) is necessary. A HESS is usually formed by two complementary storage devices that can be associated in many different topologies. Of course, the two devices have to be coordinated by an Energy Management System (EMS). In this paper the different topologies and energy management algorithms that have been applied in the RES and microgrid contexts have been analysed and compared. A review of the latest papers related to the use of HESS to facilitate the integration of the RES in the microgrid context is carried out. Some examples of the (hybrid) electric vehicles are also addressed, as the use of the HESS is more extended in this field than in the field of the microgrids.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696950","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685176/5696950/05697053.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697053","startPage":"532","endPage":"537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Energy Storage Systems for renewable Energy Sources Integration in microgrids: A review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697053/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Energy Storage Systems for renewable Energy Sources Integration in microgrids: A review","htmlLink":"/document/5697053/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11791551","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Energy Storage Systems for renewable Energy Sources Integration in microgrids: A review","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ThM54P0178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057074S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685176","isNumber":"5696950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685176","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5696950","articleId":"5697053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5697056,"authors":[{"name":"Shantanu Chakraborty","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shantanu","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37672618100"},{"name":"Tomonobu Senjyu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomonobu","lastName":"Senjyu","id":"37275165700"},{"name":"Atsushi Yona","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Yona","id":"37404086600"},{"name":"Toshihisa Funabashi","affiliation":["Meidensha Corporation, Shinagawa, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihisa","lastName":"Funabashi","id":"37275181600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7398-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7399-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7397-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1270"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1947-1262"},{"format":"CD","value":"1947-1262"}],"articleNumber":"5697056","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":619},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697056","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind power generation","Generators","Production","Security","Fuels","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","hybrid power systems","iterative methods","load (electric)","particle swarm optimisation","power generation dispatch","power generation protection","power generation scheduling","thermal power stations","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security constrained unit commitment strategy","wind thermal unit","Lagrangian relaxation","particle swarm optimization","thermal power system","wind power system","load demand","SCUC","transmission flow","iterative problem","heuristic method","Lagraingian multiplier","Gaussian distribution stochastic function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["security constrained unit commitment","Lagrangian relaxation","particle swarm optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697056","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685176/5696950/05697056.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","startPage":"549","endPage":"554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security constrained unit commitment strategy for wind/thermal units using Lagrangian relaxation based Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"System security in the generation market is one of the important aspects in power system operation under deregulated environment. It becomes more crucial when thermal power system is integrated with wind system. This paper presents an approach to determine the security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) for thermal units integrated with wind power system. A Lagrangian relaxation based algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been applied to solve this model. The method initially decomposes the load demand hours into several groups based on their homogeneity. Then instead of solving hourly SCUC, this method solves SCUC for each group. Lagrangian formulations are applied to relax the constraints with objective function using multipliers. PSO is then applied to solve UC. Since security constraints including transmission flow and voltage limits are considered, an iterative sub problem is introduced to minimize the security constraint violation using a simplified heuristic method. The Lagraingian multipliers are updated using gradient method. The process will continue until the difference between the primal and dual problem comes to a tolerable limit. To compromise the uncertainty of wind power, it is injected with the provided supply using a Gaussian distribution stochastic function. The simulation provides some analysis of the proposed method with two test systems (IEEE 6-bus and and 31-bus).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697056/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11763191","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697056/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Security constrained unit commitment strategy for wind/thermal units using Lagrangian relaxation based Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security constrained unit commitment strategy for wind/thermal units using Lagrangian relaxation based Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ThN12P0430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062204S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685176","isNumber":"5696950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685176","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5696950","articleId":"5697056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5697083,"authors":[{"name":"H.Z.

As PV installation is moving towards large scale and high penetration today, fast maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control, or in other words fast PV power control, is not always a better option for power systems, because it may cause power surge with rapid sunlight intensity increase, which can further result in network overvoltage, and this could lead to line circuit breaker tripping and damage to customers' appliances.

The proposed optimized FLC provides fast and accurate tracking of the maximum power point (MPP) under varying operating conditions. The formulation, implementation, and simulation results are presented. Results obtained has shown that the optimized FLC gives a better performance compared with the conventional FLC tuned using trial and error.","doi":"10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697136","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685176/5696950/05697136.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimized T-S fuzzy logic controller for maximum power point tracking in a photovoltaic system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Load modeling","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Fuzzy logic","Solar radiation","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","maximum power point trackers","particle swarm optimisation","photovoltaic power systems","power generation control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic controller","maximum power point tracking","photovoltaic system","trial and error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimized T-S fuzzy logic controller for maximum power point tracking in a photovoltaic system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697136/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770001","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimized T-S fuzzy logic controller for maximum power point tracking in a photovoltaic system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WeN42P0342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078118S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685176","isNumber":"5696950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685176","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5696950","articleId":"5697136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5697144,"authors":[{"name":"Rasoul Rahmani","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Power Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rasoul","lastName":"Rahmani","id":"38012474700"},{"name":"A.

However, there are some practical application issues for FCL in commercial industrial deployments. In this paper, the coordination issue of FCL with the other protective devices is discussed making use of simulation and experimental results. The fundamental point of operating a FCL is that it introduces an additional equivalent impedance into the power system and thus influencing the operation of the other protective devices, sometimes, leading to malfunction. A formula is proposed in this paper to estimate the impedance range of the equivalent FCL in order to maintain the coordination with the other protective devices. An example is used to demonstrate that the fault current can be limited by controlling the switching position of a solid state fault current limiter (SSFCL) while maintaining system coordination.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A solid state fault current limiter control algorithm","publicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","doi":"10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697153","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Conference Proceedings IPEC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685176/5696950/05697153.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPECON.2010.5697153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5696950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A solid state fault current limiter control algorithm","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697153/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763136","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A solid state fault current limiter control algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WeP24P0442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069017S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685176","isNumber":"5696950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685176","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5696950","articleId":"5697153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5697187,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaldo Sepulveda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Brunswick, NB, Canada"],"firstName":"Arnaldo","lastName":"Sepulveda","id":"37990776700"},{"name":"Liam Paull","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Brunswick, NB, Canada"],"firstName":"Liam","lastName":"Paull","id":"37935956000"},{"name":"Walid G.

Much research and attention is being given to find more environmental friendly sources of power generation. Naturally, more power is required when the load is at its peak value, and this tends to be when the most non environmentally friendly sources of power generation are used. This paper proposes a new controller for peak load shaving by intelligently scheduling power consumption of domestic electric water heater using binary particle swarm optimization. Past studies show that similar demand side management programs were not successful because the impact that the load control has on the end users' comfort. In this study, Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) finds the optimal load demand schedule for minimizing the peak load demand while maximizing customer comfort level. A simulation in Matlab is used to test the performance of the demand response program using field data gathered by smart meters from 200 households. The direct load control is shown to be an effective tool for peak shaving of load demand, shifting the loads to valleys and reducing the aggregated load of electricity without compromising customer satisfaction.","doi":"10.1109/EPEC.2010.5697187","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electrical Power & Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686264/5697169/05697187.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electrical Power & Energy Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEC.2010.5697187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel demand side management program using water heaters and particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Water heating","Load modeling","Load flow control","Particle swarm optimization","Resistance heating","Temperature","Load management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand side management","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand side management program","water heaters","power generation","binary particle swarm optimization","customer satisfaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel demand side management program using water heaters and particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697187/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763668","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel demand side management program using water heaters and particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"1724CR.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054449S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686264","isNumber":"5697169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686264","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5697169","articleId":"5697187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5697189,"authors":[{"name":"D.

As the demand for electricity grows seemingly endless, it is expected that a number of constraints, such as environmental, regulatory and economic, prevent the construction of new power plants and transmission lines. Finding improved ways to utilize the capacity supplied by existing power generation facilities and power transmission infrastructure is the problem that engineers, equipment manufacturers, and regulatory agencies are now facing. This paper introduces an optimization method using Dynamical Thermal Rating (DTR) and linear programming (LP) to minimize generation costs or transmission losses. DTR values are derived from a spatially resolved thermal model of the transmission system based on actual weather conditions along the line. This allows determination of line ampacity based on thermal bottlenecks that can exist at different locations along the line. The thermal model can also account for power losses more accurately, by considering actual distribution of temperature-dependent conductor resistance along the line. The model is used in a case study involving a simplified power transmission system with two types of generators, and a single load center. The simulation results show that more energy from hydro power plant can be transmitted to the load center, instead of using more expensive and polluting thermal generation.","doi":"10.1109/EPEC.2010.5697195","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electrical Power & Energy Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electrical Power & Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686264/5697169/05697195.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEC.2010.5697195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric power system cost/loss optimization using Dynamic Thermal Rating and linear programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697195/","displayDocTitle":"Electric power system cost/loss optimization using Dynamic Thermal Rating and linear programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763677","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697195/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric power system cost/loss optimization using Dynamic Thermal Rating and linear programming","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"1734CR.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092513S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686264","isNumber":"5697169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686264","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5697169","articleId":"5697195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5697205,"authors":[{"name":"Pooya Rezaei","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Pooya","lastName":"Rezaei","id":"38498998200"},{"name":"Mehdi Vakilian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Vakilian","id":"37269403600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8188-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8186-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8187-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5697205","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":608},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697205","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Minimization","Optimization","Sensitivity analysis","Particle swarm optimization","Simulation","Load flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","minimisation","particle swarm optimisation","power capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network","capacitor placement","modified particle swarm optimization","voltage profile improvement","energy loss","optimum capacitors setting","network reconfiguration","power loss minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitor Placement","Distribution System Reconfiguration","Loss Reduction","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EPEC.2010.5697205","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686264/5697169/05697205.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electrical Power & Energy Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Electrical Power & Energy Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEC.2010.5697205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution system efficiency improvement by reconfiguration and capacitor placement using a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm","abstract":"Capacitor placement/setting is one of the main means for loss reduction and voltage profile improvement in distribution systems. If capacitor placement is meant, the objective function will be the cost of energy losses besides the capacitors costs in a specified period of time. Here, reconfiguration can be used as a strategy to reform the base configuration of the distribution network in order to place the capacitors more efficiently with lower costs. On the other hand, if capacitors are already available in a network, optimum capacitors setting and network reconfiguration should be performed for power loss minimization. In this paper both power loss minimization and capacitor placement cost minimization are implemented using a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm. PSO is a robust optimization algorithm inspired by social behavior. Several simulations are performed on two conventional sample distribution networks and compared against the results of existing methods which demonstrated the advantage of this method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697205/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11763686","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697205/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distribution system efficiency improvement by reconfiguration and capacitor placement using a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution system efficiency improvement by reconfiguration and capacitor placement using a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"1751CR.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12301S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686264","isNumber":"5697169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686264","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5697169","articleId":"5697205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5697209,"authors":[{"name":"Nuwan Perera","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5686264/5697169/5697209/5697209-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["N.

The output of the NN is fed into a state input after a unit step delay completing the Jordan type recurrent neural network. The proposed concept is analyzed in a grid connected direct drive variable speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) WECS with a back-to-back frequency converter. Vector control of the grid side converter is realized in the grid voltage vector reference frame.

This new algorithm relies on the idea that high-resolution (HR) image patches can be correctly recovered from the downsampled low-resolution (LR) image patches under two mild conditions, i.e., the sparsity of image patches, and the incoherence between the sensing and projection matrix. Consequently if most of HR image patches can be represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from a dictionary that is incoherent with sensing matrix, the HR image patches can be recovered accurately from its LR version. To find a dictionary which can sparsely represent HR image patches to guarantee the reconstruction error over a set of patches be minimal, an example patches-aided dictionary learning algorithm named KSVD algorithm is adopted. Moreover, the incoherence between the learned dictionary and sensing matrix is experimentally investigated. The new proposed method is tested on the restoration of remote sensing images came from USC-SIPI Image Database, and the results show that the proposed algorithm can provide substantial improvement in resolution of remote sensing images, and the restored images are superior in quality to that of other related methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Super Resolution Restoration of Remote Sensing Images Based on Compressive Sensing and Example Patches-Aided Dictionary Learning","publicationTitle":"2011 International Workshop on Multi-Platform/Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing and Mapping","doi":"10.1109/M2RSM.2011.5697375","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Workshop on Multi-Platform/Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing and Mapping","pdfPath":"/iel5/5692950/5697356/05697375.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/M2RSM.2011.5697375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel Super Resolution Restoration of Remote Sensing Images Based on Compressive Sensing and Example Patches-Aided Dictionary Learning","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697375/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11772309","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Super Resolution Restoration of Remote Sensing Images Based on Compressive Sensing and Example Patches-Aided Dictionary Learning","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111729S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5692950","isNumber":"5697356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5692950","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5697356","articleId":"5697375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5697440,"authors":[{"name":"Peyman Babaei","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Babaei","id":"37990655300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8594-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8595-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8593-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5697440","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":711},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Pixel","Feature extraction","Computational modeling","Adaptation model","Streaming media","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","cameras","traffic information systems","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicles tracking","traffic zones","intersection traffic management","smart cameras","automatic vehicles counting","video surveillance","intelligent transportation systems","intersections monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Background model","vehicles classification and tracking","Intersection traffic flow","Traffic zone","Smart camera"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697440","doi":"10.1109/ICSIP.2010.5697440","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal and Image Processing","abstract":"This paper proposes an automatic vehicles counting, classification and tracking for identifying Traffic flows in an intersection which is a fundamental task for video surveillance in urban traffic management. In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), especially in field of urban traffic management, intersections monitoring is one of the critical and challenging tasks. Where, objects have different characteristics such as varying velocities, stop and go. Therefore it is necessary to use a hybrid scheme of adaptive background mixture model to learn background model faster and more accurately, instead of using single rate of adaptation, which is not adequate. The main focus of this paper is to analyze activities at intersection in number of traffic zones for counting and classifying vehicles and then tracking to extract traffic flows which assists in regulating traffic lights for using in smart cameras. Traffic zones definition in intersection video, based on trajectories clustering; greatly reduce the time and volume of computations. Smart camera's fundamental purpose is to efficiently reduce the transmission rate and also analyze an intersection scene and report statics and information of interest which is not an image. Ground-truth experiments with urban traffic sequences show that our proposed algorithm is very promising relative to results using other techniques.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIP.2010.5697440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697428","startPage":"49","endPage":"53","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686259/5697428/05697440.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicles tracking and classification using Traffic zones in a hybrid scheme for intersection traffic management by smart cameras","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5697440/","displayDocTitle":"Vehicles tracking and classification using Traffic zones in a hybrid scheme for intersection traffic management by smart cameras","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763454","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicles tracking and classification using Traffic zones in a hybrid scheme for intersection traffic management by smart cameras","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP011T110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066744S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686259","isNumber":"5697428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686259","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5697428","articleId":"5697440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5697480,"authors":[{"name":"Avijit Kundu","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Camellia Institute of Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Avijit","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37997541500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8594-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8595-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8593-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5697480","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Prediction algorithms","Diamond-like carbon","Image coding","Pixel","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","pattern matching","search problems","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified block matching algorithm","video coding standard","fast block motion estimation","video sequence","optimized search area","exhaustive full search","three step search","adaptive dual cross diamond hexagon search","modified diamond hexagon search","local motion analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block matching algorithm","motion estimation","video compression"]}],"abstract":"Motion estimation is the most important component of any video coding standard. So development of an efficient algorithm for fast motion estimation is the basic need for video encoder design. Block based motion estimation algorithms are used for fast motion estimation as block matching algorithms eliminate the temporal redundancy present in any video sequence and use optimized search area to reduce computational time. In this paper I have reviewed existing block based motion estimation algorithms like exhaustive full search (FS), three step search (TSS), adaptive dual cross diamond hexagon search (ADCDHS) and performed a comparative analysis of their performance. I have also proposed a Modified Diamond Hexagon Search which will use reduced search area compare to existing TSS, DAHSA, and ADCDHS and in turn it will reduce computational time. Application of proposed algorithm for local motion analysis is also discussed in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified block matching algorithm for fast block motion estimation","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal and Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICSIP.2010.5697480","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686259/5697428/05697480.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIP.2010.5697480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Modified block matching algorithm for fast block motion estimation","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697480/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763493","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified block matching algorithm for fast block motion estimation","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP051T802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055953S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686259","isNumber":"5697428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686259","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5697428","articleId":"5697480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5697481,"authors":[{"name":"V.S.

The chance of pregnancy will be reduced, if more than 50 percent of a man's sperm lack movement. Assessing the ability of sperm to move forward through the cervix into the fallopian tubes is a widely used measure of male infertility. Since the examination is done by a person through a microscope, a fairly simple system is used for classifying the spermatozoa. This paper proposes a technique to evaluate the motility of human spermatozoon which includes moving object detection, tracking and behavioral analysis. The objective is to measure the speed and quality of movement by tracking video clips of individual sperm cells. The approach chosen was frame differencing on consecutive frames, which identifies moving objects from the portion of a video frame that differs significantly from the previous frame. This method has less computation complexity, high recognition rate and a faster processing speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697481/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11763494","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697481/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spermatozoa detection, counting and tracking in video streams to detect asthenozoospermia","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spermatozoa detection, counting and tracking in video streams to detect asthenozoospermia","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP052T901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046905S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686259","isNumber":"5697428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686259","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5697428","articleId":"5697481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5697486,"authors":[{"name":"C.

RBFC approach is used for segmentation of speech signal and the results are compared with other voiced segmentation approaches. Berlin emotional speech database is used for experimental purpose.

The reason for the attractiveness of ECC is that there is no sub-exponential algorithm known to solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. This leads to lower memory requirements, lower computation requirements and higher security than other public key cryptosystems. This project describes an implementation of a micro coded elliptic curve processor using FPGA technology. This processor implements optimal normal basis field operations. The design is generated by a parameterized module generator which can accommodate arbitrary n and also produce field multipliers with different speed/area tradeoffs. The control part of the processor is micro coded, enabling curve operations to be incorporated into the processor hence reducing the chip's I/O requirements. The micro coded approach also facilitates rapid development and algorithmic optimization. for example, projective and affine coordinates were supported using different sets of micro codes. The design was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan -II kit device. Elliptic curve processor is particularly suitable for recourse limited devices because of its lower requirements of memory and computation. It is applicable to be implanted into smart cards, cellular phones and other hand-held devices so that secure communication can be provided.

Similarly the decomposed pixel is regrouped using 9 column counters. This architecture requires a less number of slices and look up table for its VLSI implementation.

The aims of this study are to find the significant control action that alleviates a bus voltage violation of a power system and to demonstrate the ability of a neural network in terms of evaluating the generation re-dispatch and load shedding amounts. The remedial action is based on a steady-state security assessment of the power system. The proposed algorithm has been successfully tested on a 9-bus test system. The results are compared with other conventional methods and it reveals that an ANN can provide the required amount of generation re-dispatch and load shedding accurately and instantaneously compared to other methods. On average, remedial actions were shown to have a positive effect for reducing the number of bus voltage violations and improving system security.","doi":"10.1109/PECON.2010.5697671","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684398/5697536/05697671.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"711","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECON.2010.5697671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control action based on steady-state security assessment using an Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Control action based on steady-state security assessment using an Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11773069","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5697671/","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control action based on steady-state security assessment using an Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092788S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684398","isNumber":"5697536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684398","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5697536","articleId":"5697671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5697675,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Hadi Salar","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University South Tehran Branch, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hadi","lastName":"Salar","id":"37992045000"},{"name":"Mahmoud Reza Haghifam","affiliation":["Tarbiat Moalem University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmoud Reza","lastName":"Haghifam","id":"37300552500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8946-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8947-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8945-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5697675","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697675","abstract":"Cost allocation and determining the part of the operators in a power system from the total costs are among the most important issues appeared along with the restructuring in the power industry. One of these imposed costs in the utilization domain is the cost of the power losses which should be fairly distributed between the participants in the electric power market. In this paper, using the load flow calculations, the part of each bus in the power losses is determined by the Z-Bus method. These results are compared with those obtained from the load flow calculations using the artificial neural network. It is shown that the artificial neural network is an efficient tool for power loss allocation in the large and complicated power systems which may have a nonlinear nature. The proposed method is then applied to two test bench systems, the IEEE 5-bus and 30-bus test benches, and the results from two approaches are compared and the differences in term of error are reported. A real case study including a 400kV transmission system is also studied and the annual peak-load power loss allocation assuming the peak hour in a month is determined and the related errors are computed.","doi":"10.1109/PECON.2010.5697675","startPage":"729","endPage":"734","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684398/5697536/05697675.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECON.2010.5697675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission loss allocation in power systems using artificial neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Resource management","Propagation losses","Load flow","Training","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","neural nets","power engineering computing","power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission loss allocation","power systems","artificial neural network","cost allocation","power industry","electric power market","load flow","Z-Bus method","IEEE 5-bus","IEEE 30-bus","voltage 400 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Loss Allocation","Neural Network","Load Flow","Error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Transmission loss allocation in power systems using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697675/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773070","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission loss allocation in power systems using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115763S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684398","isNumber":"5697536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684398","xplore-issue":"5697536","articleId":"5697675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5697701,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Aminian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Aminian","id":"37395463200"},{"name":"Ehsan Moazami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Moazami","id":"37992091000"},{"name":"Maryam Mirzaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Mirzaei","id":"38011658800"},{"name":"Mohd Zainal Abidin Ab Kadir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Zainal Abidin Ab","lastName":"Kadir","id":"37718721500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8946-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8947-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8945-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5697701","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transformer insulation","Oil insulation","Gallium","Circuit faults","Loading","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","genetic algorithms","power system reliability","power system restoration","power system stability","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","service restoration optimization","electrical networks","transformers failure probability","power system reliability","power system stability","multiobjective multiconstraint optimization problem","out-of-service area minimization","minimum electrical power loss minimization","condition monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electrical power system","transformer failure","genetic algorithm","restoration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697701","abstract":"Power system reliability, stability and efficiency are the most important issues to insure continuously feeding of customers. However in process of time, system will be age and the probability of failures will increase and faults inevitably will occur. When a fault occurs, the first reaction is isolation of the faulty area, then with aid of software and/or skillful person quick restoration is essentially needed. To minimize the out-of-service area and activity time of restoration many methods are suggested depend on objectives and constraints of restoration strategy. In many researches a Genetic Algorithm is employed as a powerful tool to solve this multi-objective, multi-constraint optimization problem. Out-of-service area minimization, reduce the number of switching operation and minimizing the minimum electrical power loss in restored system are the prior objectives of restoration plan. In this paper, as transformers are the most expensive and more effective equipments in the electrical network, failure probability increasing is introduced as a new constraint in genetic algorithm by authors. Expected results of this new algorithm should lead to a new plan of restoration in permissible ranges of transformer loading in respect of their age, previous experienced faults and condition monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/PECON.2010.5697701","startPage":"870","endPage":"873","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECON.2010.5697701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697536","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684398/5697536/05697701.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposed Genetic Algorithm to optimize service restoration in electrical networks with respect to the probability of transformers failure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697701/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A proposed Genetic Algorithm to optimize service restoration in electrical networks with respect to the probability of transformers failure","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697701/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11773091","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposed Genetic Algorithm to optimize service restoration in electrical networks with respect to the probability of transformers failure","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095171S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684398","isNumber":"5697536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684398","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5697536","articleId":"5697701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5697729,"authors":[{"name":"Hannes Bistry","affiliation":["Dept of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Bistry","id":"37601289600"},{"name":"Boris Wolter","affiliation":["University of Hamburg, Institute of Applied Physics, Germany"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Wolter","id":"37991813800"},{"name":"Bernd Sch\u00fctz","affiliation":["Dept of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Sch\u00fctz","id":"37863365300"},{"name":"Roland Wiesendanger","affiliation":["University of Hamburg, Institute of Applied Physics, Germany"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Wiesendanger","id":"37319690200"},{"name":"Jianwei Zhang","affiliation":["Dept of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281460600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7032-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7033-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7031-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9380"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"5697729","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image resolution","matrix algebra","scanning tunnelling microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated scale invariant STM","scan matching","scale invariant feature transform","SIFT","automated matching","scanning tunneling microscope images","image resolutions","transformation matrices","automated atom manipulation","spatial uncertainty","sophisticated control"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present our research on automated matching of Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) images acquired at different scales and resolutions.

The channels with the depth up to 150um can be achieved by implementing a typical photoresist and wet etching process without any complicated deposition methods such as CVD, evaporation or other sophisticated techniques. In particular, AZ5214 photoresist is for the first time introduced for glass etching mask which can strongly resist against etchant attacks up to 2 hours, showing high accuracy for fabrication of microfluidic microchannels. The width of the channels is determined by the width of the lines in photo-mask design and the etch rate of the substrate because of glass isotropic etching characteristics. In practical the channel width range about 30\u03bcm to 350\u03bcm is attainable. Commercially available inexpensive microscopic slides have been used as substrate for etching channels using special etchant solutions. The etch rate of the glass strongly depends on the concentration of the etchant. Achieving smooth and clear surface after wet etching process is an important factor for easily flowing fluid through channels and monitoring purposes. A mixture of different solutions with special ratios has been applied to achieve smooth and clear surface of the etching regions. Two different bonding techniques, optical UV curable glue, and glass-PDMS-glass methods for adhering the etched glass substrate and non-etched glass cover is applied. A novel method for packaging, tubing and fittings for microfluidic devices using PMMA has been presented without the need for any drilling process.","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International

We have been developed the nanorobotic manipulation system inside an Environmental-Scanning Electron Microscope (E-SEM). The E-SEM provides the real-time high resolution image under water-contained condition. We have been applied this system for nano-biomanipulation, nano-bioevaluation, single cell-manipulation environments using various nanotools and nanodevices. The stiffness values are important to reveal and evaluate the cell condition depending on health, diagnosis, growth phase, and so on. The deformation of the biological organism can be observed by E-SEM with real-time imaging. In this paper, the local stiffness distribution of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is evaluated. Using single nanoprobe, we can evaluate the local stiffness individually. However, it is needed time and precise alignment to measure distributed values at each points. In this paper, we fabricate the comb-type silicon nanoprobes to measure the local stiffness distribution in each C. elegans. The local stiffness distribution will be discussed depended on the growth phase or mutation of C. elegans.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2010.5697861","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2010.5697861","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1035","pdfPath":"/iel5/5682486/5697724/05697861.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697861/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of local stiffness distribution for biological organism by comb-nanoprobes","conferenceDate":"17-20 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11772707","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5697861/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of local stiffness distribution for biological organism by comb-nanoprobes","confLoc":"Ilsan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICOTS11022Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058185S","chronDate":"17-20 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5682486","isNumber":"5697724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5682486","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5697724","articleId":"5697861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5697869,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37715113800"},{"name":"Minsu Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Minsu","lastName":"Choi","id":"37275573500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7032-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7033-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7031-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9380"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"5697869","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":657},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5697869","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Memristors","Table lookup","Hysteresis","Nanoscale devices","Wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","logic gates","memristors","nanowires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor lookup table","asynchronous nanowire crossbar architecture","configurable memristors","delay-insensitive logic paradigm","null convention logic gate function","clock-free operation","primitive logic block","programmable gate macro block","state-holding behavior","feedback interconnect","process-voltage-temperature variations","low-noise asynchronous operation","encoding-level logic inversion","event-driven low-power asynchronous operation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nanowire crossbar","Asynchronous computing","Null convention logic(NCL)","Reconfigurable logic","Memristor","Lookup table (LUT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NANO.2010.5697869","endPage":"1103","startPage":"1100","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5682486/5697724/05697869.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2010.5697869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor lookup table (MLUT)-based asynchronous nanowire crossbar architecture","abstract":"In this work, a novel memristor lookup table (MLUT)-based asynchronous nanowire reconfigurable crossbar architecture (ANRCA) is proposed. Unlike the existing nanowire crossbar architectures that mostly use crosspoints as pro-grammable diodes and/or field-effect transistors, the proposed architecture utilizes crosspoints as configurable memristors to realize nanoscale lookup tables (LUTs) and relies on a delay-insensitive logic paradigm known as Null Convention Logic (NCL) for the proposed clock-free operation. The primitive logic block of the proposed MLUT ANRCA is referred to as the Programmable Gate Macro Block (PGMB) and can be programmed to realize any given NCL gate function by directly implementing the truth table of the given NCL gate function using the proposed MLUT and also providing hysteresis (i.e., state-holding behavior) that is required to achieve the proposed delay-insensitivity via a feedback interconnect. Potential technical merits of the proposed MLUT ANRCA includes: 1) better manufacturability due to structural simplicity and regularity; 2) improved robustness over PVT (Process-Voltage-Temperature) variations; 3) event-driven low-power/noise asynchronous operation; and 4) encoding-level logic inversion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697869/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697869/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11772714","conferenceDate":"17-20 Aug. 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Memristor lookup table (MLUT)-based asynchronous nanowire crossbar architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor lookup table (MLUT)-based asynchronous nanowire crossbar architecture","confLoc":"Ilsan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICOTS12010Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054632S","chronDate":"17-20 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5682486","isNumber":"5697724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5682486","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5697724","articleId":"5697869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5697872,"authors":[{"name":"Himanshu Thapliyal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Himanshu","lastName":"Thapliyal","id":"37294966700"},{"name":"Nagarajan Ranganathan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Nagarajan","lastName":"Ranganathan","id":"37273564100"},{"name":"Ryan Ferreira","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"38001773100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7032-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7033-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7031-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9380"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"5697872","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Delay","Binary trees","Equations","Propagation delay","Quantum computing","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparators (circuits)","logic gates","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparator tree","reversible logic","reversible n-bit binary comparator","binary tree structure","latency","2-bit reversible binary comparator","root node","Toffoli gate","NOT gates","word length 2 bit"]}],"abstract":"The ex\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\nsting design of reversible n-bit binary comparator that compares two n-bit numbers is a serial design [1] having the latency of O(n).

Its dynamic scalability enables users to quickly scale up and scale down underlying infrastructure in response to business volume, performance desire and other dynamic behaviors. However, challenges arise when considering computing instance non-deterministic acquisition time, multiple VM instance types, unique cloud billing models and user budget constraints. Planning enough computing resources for user desired performance with less cost, which can also automatically adapt to workload changes, is not a trivial problem. In this paper, we present a cloud auto-scaling mechanism to automatically scale computing instances based on workload information and performance desire. Our mechanism schedules VM instance startup and shut-down activities. It enables cloud applications to finish submitted jobs within the deadline by controlling underlying instance numbers and reduces user cost by choosing appropriate instance types.

Almost all research works related to this kind of algorithms do not pay much attention to energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the energy issue in task scheduling particularly on high-performance computing systems (HCSs). We propose a new island-based bi-objective hybrid algorithm that takes into account, not only makespan, but also energy consumption. The proposed approach uses dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) to minimize energy consumption. Our study provides the significance and potential of DVS. The proposed approach is powerful as it profits from the cooperative paradigm of the island model. Indeed, the obtained results show that our approach outperforms previous scheduling methods, in terms of energy consumption, by a noticeable margin. The obtained schedules are also shorter, in terms of completion time, than those of other algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5697985/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11763425","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5697985/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A parallel island-based hybrid genetic algorithm for precedence-constrained applications to minimize energy consumption and makespan","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel island-based hybrid genetic algorithm for precedence-constrained applications to minimize energy consumption and makespan","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"2002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071909S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685607","isNumber":"5697799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685607","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5697799","articleId":"5697985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5697990,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew W.

We use HPL as a representative tightly coupled computational workload and a web server providing content to customers as a representative loosely coupled network intensive workload. The performance evaluation demonstrates VM granularity has a significant impact on the performance of the computational workload. On an 8-CPU machine, the performance obtained from utilizing 8VMs is more than 4 times higher than that given by 4 or 16 VMs for HPL of problem size 4096; whereas on two machines with a total of 12 CPUs 24 VMs gives the best performance for HPL of problem sizes from 256 to 1024. Our results also indicate that the effect of VM granularity on the performance of the web system is not critical. The largest standard deviation of the transaction rates obtained from varying VM granularity is merely 2.89 with a mean value of 21.34. These observations suggest that VM malleability strategies where VM granularity is changed dynamically, can be used to improve the performance of tightly coupled computational workloads, whereas VM consolidation for energy savings can be more effectively applied to loosely coupled network intensive workloads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 11th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685607/5697799/05698018.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"400","publicationTitle":"2010 11th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Grid Computing","doi":"10.1109/GRID.2010.5698018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRID.2010.5698018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of virtual machine granularity on cloud computing workloads performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Cloud computing","Web server","Niobium","Benchmark testing","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual machine granularity","cloud computing workloads performance","cloud computing environments","web server","network intensive workload","VM malleability strategies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Granularity","Malleability","Performance","Virtual Machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Impact of virtual machine granularity on cloud computing workloads performance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698018/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763439","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of virtual machine granularity on cloud computing workloads performance","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"4002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074229S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685607","isNumber":"5697799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685607","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5697799","articleId":"5698018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5698053,"authors":[{"name":"Kaustav Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaustav","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37272724900"},{"name":"Hong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Li","id":"37407161000"},{"name":"Chuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404060600"},{"name":"Yasin Khatami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yasin","lastName":"Khatami","id":"37547217000"},{"name":"Hamed F.

Extracted map has been used for estimating leakage power and critical path delay in placement. Proposed placement algorithm that's named Total Power Aware Placement (TPAP) is implemented on VPR and power estimation and measurement has been computed by PowerModel and ACE tools in 45-nm technology. Simulation results for 20 MCNC benchmark circuits show that Power-Delay Product (PDP) parameter has been improved nearly 7.2% compared with default VPR placement algorithm. Simulations for each benchmark circuit are repeated 10 times for different variation maps. Results show that, PDP improvement standard deviation is 16.8%. As a result, proposed placement algorithm is adaptable with per-chip variation map, so proposed algorithm has been named chip-dependent algorithm.","publicationTitle":"National Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"National Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5687566/5697726/05698088.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chip-dependent leakage Power-Aware Placement algorithm for FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698088/","displayDocTitle":"Chip-dependent leakage Power-Aware Placement algorithm for FPGAs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763878","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698088/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chip-dependent leakage Power-Aware Placement algorithm for FPGAs","confLoc":"Bursa, Turkey","sourcePdf":"final1089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06015S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5687566","isNumber":"5697726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5687566","xplore-issue":"5697726","articleId":"5698088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chambers of Turkish Elec E","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5698122,"authors":[{"name":"Fatma Yildirim Dalkiran","affiliation":["Erciyes \u00dcniversitesi, Kayseri, Turkey"],"firstName":"Fatma","lastName":"Yildirim Dalkiran","id":"37892296300"},{"name":"Enis G\u00fcnay","affiliation":["Erciyes \u00dcniversitesi, Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fch, Kayseri, Turkey"],"firstName":"Enis","lastName":"G\u00fcnay","id":"37294559400"},{"name":"Recai Kili\u00e7","affiliation":["Erciyes \u00dcniversitesi, Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fch, Kayseri, Turkey"],"firstName":"Recai","lastName":"Kili\u00e7","id":"37327023600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-605-01-0013-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9588-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5698122","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698122","abstract":"Cellular Neural Network (CNN)-based chaos generators have attracted considerable interest, and many theoretical and experimental studies related to these generators have been presented in the literature.

This paper investigates the sensitivity of MC-CDMA performance to guard interval and demonstrates a novel approach to determine the Optimum Guard Interval (OGI).

The OGI for a given channel profile and system parameters is determined as the guard interval with maximum SNR.

We aim to clarify the validity of this simplification by quantifying the impact of obstructions through a series of wireless experiments. Using two cars equipped with Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) hardware designed for vehicular use, we perform experimental measurements in order to collect received signal power and packet delivery ratio information in a multitude of relevant scenarios: parking lot, highway, suburban and urban canyon. Upon separating the data into line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) categories, our results show that obstructing vehicles cause significant impact on the channel quality. A single obstacle can cause a drop of over 20 dB in received signal strength when two cars communicate at a distance of 10 m. At longer distances, NLOS conditions affect the usable communication range, effectively halving the distance at which communication can be achieved with 90% chance of success. The presented results motivate the inclusion of vehicles in the radio propagation models used for VANET simulation in order to increase the level of realism.","doi":"10.1109/VNC.2010.5698233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNC.2010.5698233","startPage":"338","endPage":"345","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686850/5698226/05698233.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental study on the impact of vehicular obstructions in VANETs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Experimental study on the impact of vehicular obstructions in VANETs","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698233/","accessionNumber":"11763860","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698233/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental study on the impact of vehicular obstructions in VANETs","confLoc":"Jersey City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569357657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.245409S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686850","isNumber":"5698226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686850","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5698226","articleId":"5698233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5698242,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Sommer","affiliation":["Computer Networks, University of Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Sommer","id":"37547372900"},{"name":"Ozan K.

From previous research findings, we see that centralized solutions, VANETs, and broadcasting based approaches each show benefits and drawbacks depending on traffic density, penetration, network utilization, and other parameters; intelligent transportation systems are therefore tuned for specific settings. In order to overcome this limitation, we developed a broadcast-based solution that has been designed to carefully use only the remaining capacity of the wireless channel. Thus, it will not influence other applications using the same radio network. ATB is adaptive in two dimensions: First, the beacon interval is adapted dynamically according to the channel quality and the importance of messages in the local knowledge base, and, secondly, the protocol can dynamically make use of available infrastructure elements. Simulation experiments demonstrate that ATB performs well in a broad range of settings. It maintains a non-congested wireless channel to prevent collisions during the data exchange.","doi":"10.1109/VNC.2010.5698242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNC.2010.5698242","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686850/5698226/05698242.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beaconing for delay-sensitive and congestion-aware traffic information systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beaconing for delay-sensitive and congestion-aware traffic information systems","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698242/","accessionNumber":"11763868","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698242/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beaconing for delay-sensitive and congestion-aware traffic information systems","confLoc":"Jersey City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569358661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101096S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686850","isNumber":"5698226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686850","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5698226","articleId":"5698242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5698245,"authors":[{"name":"Vinh Van Phan","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Vinh","lastName":"Van Phan","id":"37888413800"},{"name":"Kari Horneman","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Kari","lastName":"Horneman","id":"37269213500"},{"name":"Ling Yu","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Yu","id":"38003675300"},{"name":"Jaakko Vihriala","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jaakko","lastName":"Vihriala","id":"37269214300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9525-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9526-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9524-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9865"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9857"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9857"}],"articleNumber":"5698245","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":637},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Wireless communication","Transportation","Mobile computing","Mobile radio mobility management","Radio link"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cooperative communication","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular coverage","public transportation","smart relay systems","coordinated and cooperative relay systems","architecture alternatives"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular network","coordinated and cooperative relay","LTE-A","mobile wireless backhaul","transportation"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a notion of coordinated and cooperative relay systems (CCRS) for providing enhanced cellular coverage in highly populated public transportation such as passenger trains, cruise ships, etc. This notion considers a closed group of relay nodes and cells thereof, deployed together for particular service area of interest, as a new interconnected-and-extended network entity of advanced cellular systems - the CCRS.

Most of the existing security mechanisms focus on traditional cryptographic schemes. In recent years, features of multi-path channels, such as randomness, coherence and reciprocity, have driven researchers to exploit their potential to enhance the security of mobile wireless networks. As OFDM occupies wide bandwidth, it will experience a prolific source of multi-path components. In this paper, we comprehensively exploit the inherent physical features of the multi-path fading channel to achieve continuous two way authentication between mobile terminals. In our scheme, the coherence of the time-variant channel for the continuous symbols is exploited to achieve authentication of the OFDM communication networks. Unlike other channel-based approaches, the coherence of both amplitude and phase of the channel signature in the continuous symbol is utilized to enhance the security of the OFDM communication network. More specifically, the receiver will detect the channel response continuously according to the inserted pilots and identify the legal user based on the statistical channel signature information. Simulation results indicate the high efficiency of our proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/VNC.2010.5698262","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686850/5698226/05698262.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNC.2010.5698262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698226","startPage":"346","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical layer assisted security for mobile OFDM networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physical layer assisted security for mobile OFDM networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698262/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11770145","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5698262/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical layer assisted security for mobile OFDM networks","confLoc":"Jersey City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569359179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09154S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686850","isNumber":"5698226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686850","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5698226","articleId":"5698262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5698307,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The fusion in medical images is necessary for efficient diseases diagnosis from multimodality, multidimensional and multiparameter type of images. This paper describes a multimodality medical image fusion system using different fusion techniques and the resultant is analysed with quantitative measures. Initially, the registered images from two different modalities such as CT (anatomical information) and MRI-T2, FLAIR (pathological information) are considered as input, since the diagnosis requires anatomical and pathological information. Then the fusion techniques namely Redundancy Discrete Wavelet Transform (RDWT) and Contourlet Transform are applied. Further the fused image is analyzed with five types of quantitative metrics such as Standard Deviation (SD), Entropy (EN), Overall Cross Entropy (OCE), Ratio of Spatial Frequency Error (RSFE), and Power Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for performance evaluation. From the experimental results we observed that RDWT method provides better information (quality) using EN metric and the Contourlet Transform gives the difference in source to the fused image using OCE metric and also the fused image obtained from the proposed fusion techniques has more information than the source images are proved through all metrics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5696799/5698278/05698307.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"139","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2010.122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2010.122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundancy Discrete Wavelet Transform and Contourlet Transform for Multimodality Medical Image Fusion with Quantitative Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computed tomography","Filter bank","Entropy","Measurement","Biomedical imaging","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","computerised tomography","discrete wavelet transforms","image fusion","image registration","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redundancy discrete wavelet transform","Contourlet transform","multimodality medical image fusion","image registration","standard deviation metric","entropy metric","overall cross entropy metric","spatial frequency error ratio metric","power signal to noise ratio metric","computed tomography","magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medical image fusion","Multimodality images","Redundancy Discrete Wavelet Transform","Contourlet Transform","Quantitative Metrics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Redundancy Discrete Wavelet Transform and Contourlet Transform for Multimodality Medical Image Fusion with Quantitative Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698307/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11832729","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundancy Discrete Wavelet Transform and Contourlet Transform for Multimodality Medical Image Fusion with Quantitative Analysis","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"4246a134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07372S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5696799","isNumber":"5698278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5696799","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5698278","articleId":"5698307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5698328,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.

For recording daily human activity, monitoring system which consists of multiple micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) has been developed. Using the MEMS based monitoring system, numerical data of subject's activity can be stored into a database. For example, when subject's activity on a single day is recorded, a huge volume of data is saved. To estimate the subject's activity condition from such a huge volume data, a fuzzy rule based approach is used in our study. Our proposed method consists of two steps of abstraction. First, action primitives are defined. In the first-step abstraction, sensor data is expressed as a sequence of actions by using the defined action primitives. Next, a fuzzy rule which maps a sequence of actions to a behavior is defined for each behavior. In the second-step abstraction, each sequence of actions is expressed as a behavior. From the results of abstraction, we can estimate the subject's state.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5698364/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11832786","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Action Estimation from Human Activity Monitoring Data Using Soft Computing Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action Estimation from Human Activity Monitoring Data Using Soft Computing Approach","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"4246a434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102122S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5696799","isNumber":"5698278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5696799","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5698278","articleId":"5698364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5698377,"authors":[{"name":"Kalpana C.

The face features are first extracted by PCA method. The Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) is commonly used in pattern recognition. It finds a linear subspace that maximally separates class patterns. The resulting features from PCA are further processed by the Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) technique to acquire lower-dimensional discriminant patterns.

It has been seen that the facial changes due to variations of pose, illumination, expression, etc. are appeared only some regions of the whole image. Therefore, the conventional face recognition methods, which use whole image for feature extraction and recognition, do not result much success. To cope with the above facial changes, face images are divided into a number of non-overlapping sub-images and then G-2DFLD method is applied to each of these sub-images as well as to the whole image to extract local and global discriminant features, respectively. A multi-class SVM is used as a classifier for each of the sub-images and also for the whole image for recognition based on those extracted features. Finally, a decision is made for recognition of the image by fusing the decisions of the individual SVMs. The proposed HAFR G-2DFLD method was evaluated on two popular face recognition databases, the AT&T and the UMIST face databases. The experimental results show that the new HAFR G-2DFLD method outperforms the conventional global feature extraction methods like, PCA, 2DPCA, PCA+FLD, 2DFLD and G-2DFLD methods in terms of face recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2010.80","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5696799/5698278/05698378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2010.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698278","startPage":"506","endPage":"511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Approach to Face Recognition Using Generalized Two-Dimensional Fisher's Linear Discriminant Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Approach to Face Recognition Using Generalized Two-Dimensional Fisher's Linear Discriminant Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698378/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11832800","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5698378/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Approach to Face Recognition Using Generalized Two-Dimensional Fisher's Linear Discriminant Method","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"4246a506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119897S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5696799","isNumber":"5698278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5696799","xplore-issue":"5698278","articleId":"5698378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5698383,"authors":[{"name":"Sudhir Kumar Sharma","affiliation":["Ansal Institute of Technology, GGS Indraprastha University, Gurgaon, India"],"firstName":"Sudhir Kumar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37329333300"},{"name":"Pravin Chandra","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics & Communication, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Pravin","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37271944300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8481-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4246-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0477"}],"articleNumber":"5698383","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function approximation","gradient methods","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive slope sigmoidal function","cascading neural network","cascade 2 algorithm","cascade-correlation algorithm","constructive neural networks","architectural adaptation","functional adaptation","cascading architecture","gradient descent method","sequential mode","weight update rule","slope parameter","nonlinear nodes","ASCNNA","function approximation","fixed shape sigmoidal function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aadaptive slope sigmoidal function","Cascade-Correlation algorithm","Cascade 2 algorithm","Constructive neural networks","Dynamic node creation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Cascade 2 algorithm is a variant of Cascade-Correlation algorithm that is a well-known and widely used constructive neural networks algorithm.

This algorithm is a constructive approach of building cascading architecture and uses gradient descent method in sequential mode as the weight update rule of individual hidden node. To achieve functional adaptation, the slope of the sigmoidal function is adapted during learning. The algorithm determines not only the optimum number of hidden layers' node, as also the optimum value of the slope parameter of sigmoidal function for nonlinear nodes. One simple variant derived from ASCNNA is where the slope parameter of sigmoidal function is fixed. Both the variants are compared to each other on five function approximation tasks. Simulation results reveal that adaptive slope sigmoidal function presents several advantages over traditional fixed shape sigmoidal function, resulting in increased flexibility, smoother learning, and better convergence and generalization performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Slope Sigmoidal Function Cascading Neural Networks Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2010.71","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5696799/5698278/05698383.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2010.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Slope Sigmoidal Function Cascading Neural Networks Algorithm","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698383/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11832805","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Slope Sigmoidal Function Cascading Neural Networks Algorithm","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"4246a531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08871S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5696799","isNumber":"5698278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5696799","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5698278","articleId":"5698383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5698390,"authors":[{"name":"Praveen K.

High speed digital telecommunication systems such as OFDM and DSL need real-time high-speed computation of the Fast Fourier Transform. Thus there is a need of innovative algorithms to improve the speed. In this paper, we propose vedic algorithm for the implementation of multipliers to be used in the FFT. Vedic mathematics (VM) comes with the simplest and effective algorithm for solving any typical engineering problem standing on the pillars of the \u201cVedic\u201d principles. The conventional multiplication method requires more time & area on silicon than vedic algorithms. More importantly processing speed increases with the bit length. This will help ultimately to speed up the signal processing task, as it is well known that the multiplier is the basic building block of FFT. The VM has been synthesized for the target device 5vlx30ff324-3.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5696799/5698278/05698399.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"619","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2010.57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2010.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation and Synthesis of Multiplier Used in FFT Operation Using Conventional and Vedic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Hardware","Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis","Digital signal processing","Books"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vedic multiplier","Vedic algorithm","digital signal processing","high speed digital telecommunication system","OFDM","DSL","real-time high-speed computation","fast Fourier transform","Vedic mathematics","multiplication method","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FFT","Multipliers","Vedic algorithms [Urdhva Triyakbhyam]","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation and Synthesis of Multiplier Used in FFT Operation Using Conventional and Vedic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11832821","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation and Synthesis of Multiplier Used in FFT Operation Using Conventional and Vedic Algorithms","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"4246a614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061923S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5696799","isNumber":"5698278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5696799","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5698278","articleId":"5698399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5698402,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

Now-a-days various DSP systems are implemented on a variety of programmable signal processors or on application specific VLSI chips. Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm has turned out to be widely researched topic in the field of vector rotated Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications due to its simplicity. This paper presents the design of pipelined architecture for coordinate rotation algorithm for the computation of loop performance of complex Digital Phase Locked Loop (DPLL). The design of CORDIC in the vector rotation mode results in high system throughput due to its pipelined architecture where latency is reduced in each of the pipelined stage. Saving area on silicon substrate is essential to the design of any pipelined CORDIC. The area reduction in proposed design can be achieved through optimization in the number of micro rotations. For better loop performance of first order complex DPLL and to minimize quantization error, the number of iterations are also optimized.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2010.164","startPage":"721","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5696799/5698278/05698421.pdf","endPage":"725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2010.164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xploreNote":"One of the author's name incorrectly added as Brajesh Kumar should read Kaushik, B.K","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698421/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Coordinate Rotation Algorithm for Digital Phase Locked Loop System in In-Phase and Quadrature Channel Signal Processing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5698421/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11832843","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Coordinate Rotation Algorithm for Digital Phase Locked Loop System in In-Phase and Quadrature Channel Signal Processing","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"4246a721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151865S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5696799","isNumber":"5698278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5696799","xplore-issue":"5698278","articleId":"5698421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5698422,"authors":[{"name":"Nishant Ghate","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunication, G.

Compression of images leads to reduction of storage space and reduces transmission bandwidth and hence also the cost. Advances in VLSI technology are rapidly changing the technological needs of common man. One of the major technological domains that are directly related to mankind is image compression. Neural networks can be used for image compression. Neural network architectures have proven to be more reliable, robust, and programmable and offer better performance when compared with classical techniques. In this paper the main focus is to development of new architectures for hardware implementation of neural network based image compression optimizing area, power and speed as specific to ASIC implementation, and comparison with FPGA. The proposed architecture design is realized on ASIC using Synopsys tools targeting 130nm TSMC library. The ASIC implementation for 16 input neuron with low power techniques adopted such as buffer insertion, clock gating and power gating limits dynamic power in the range 449\u03bcW to 713\u03bcW, cell leakage power to 18\u03bcW to 28\u03bcW, total cell area from 6319 Sq \u03bcm to 8662 Sq \u03bcm with maximum frequency ranging from 80MHz to 120MHz. ASIC physical design reports, the total power to be 20.2574\u03bcW, 97% better than the power during synthesis. In ASIC Physical Design a chip size of 14334.07Sq \u03bcm is achieved out of which the core area is 9945.07Sq \u03bcm, and it requires 8 metal layers for routing total wire length of 12592.2\u03bcm.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2010.87","pdfPath":"/iel5/5696799/5698278/05698427.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"754","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2010.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Architecuture for Neural Network Based Image Compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Architecuture for Neural Network Based Image Compression","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11832849","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5698427/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Architecuture for Neural Network Based Image Compression","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"4246a749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036966S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5696799","isNumber":"5698278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5696799","xplore-issue":"5698278","articleId":"5698427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5698429,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Darji","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Darji","id":"37545627800"},{"name":"A.N.

However, increasing clock speed is not viable due to heat dissipation and power consumption constraints. Hence Instead of trying to increase the clock speed, multi-core processor architectures with the lower frequency can be used. A multi-core processor is a single integrated circuit in which two or more processors have been attached for enhanced performance, reduced power consumption and more efficient simultaneous processing of multiple tasks. This paper presents multicore embedded controller designed with multiple Leon processors. System has developed with centralized shared memory, shared bus, tightly-coupled homogeneous scalable architecture. From the result it is concluded that Power consumption reduces by increasing number for on chip cores.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2010.153","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5696799/5698278/05698432.pdf","startPage":"776","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2010.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Shared Resource Based Multicore Embedded Controller Using LEON Processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698432/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Shared Resource Based Multicore Embedded Controller Using LEON Processor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11832854","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698432/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Shared Resource Based Multicore Embedded Controller Using LEON Processor","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"4246a776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038257S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5696799","isNumber":"5698278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5696799","xplore-issue":"5698278","articleId":"5698432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5698440,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

The objective is to minimize a first order cost function subject to linear constraints. The dynamic analog circuit, consisting of N identical units for N variable problem, can solve the general LPP and always converges to the optimal solution in constant time, irrespective of the initial conditions, which is of the order of its time constant. The proposed circuit employs non-linear feedback, in the form of Differential Voltage Current Conveyor (DVCC) based unipolar comparators, to introduce transcendental terms in the energy function ensuring fast convergence to the solution. Further, the use of resistors to generate weighted inputs to the neurons is avoided. Instead, DVCCs are utilized to directly generate the required scaled currents. PSPICE simulation results are presented for a chosen optimization problem and are found to agree with the algebraic solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DVCC-based non-linear analog circuit for solving linear programming problems","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power, Control and Embedded Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICPCES.2010.5698617","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power, Control and Embedded Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686263/5698599/05698617.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPCES.2010.5698617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"A DVCC-based non-linear analog circuit for solving linear programming problems","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698617/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11763574","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DVCC-based non-linear analog circuit for solving linear programming problems","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"finalpaper125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032863S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686263","isNumber":"5698599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686263","xplore-issue":"5698599","articleId":"5698617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5698618,"authors":[{"name":"Bhanu Pratap","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Bhanu","lastName":"Pratap","id":"37546704300"},{"name":"Shubhi Purwar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Shubhi","lastName":"Purwar","id":"37271160700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8542-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8543-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8541-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5698618","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":574},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Rotors","Transmission line measurements","MIMO","Equations","DC motors","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","observers","robust control","rotors","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding mode state observer","2 DOF twin rotor MIMO system","nonlinear system","robust control","asymptotic stability","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","sliding mode technique","state observer","twin rotor MIMO system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a sliding mode state observer for the 2-DOF twin rotor MIMO (multi-input-multi-output) system which belongs to a class of inherently nonlinear systems.

In this paper, two different algorithms, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) have been discussed. In the training of the ANNs, we use historic data. Then we use ANNs for forecasting a daily real time short-term traffic flow. The ANNs are trained by the Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm. The variable coefficients produced by temporal signals improve the performance of the BP algorithm. The temporal signals provide a new method of learning called Temporal Difference Back-Propagation (TDBP) learning. We demonstrate the capability and the performance of the TDBP learning method with the simulation results. The data of the two lane street I-494 in Minnesota city are used for this analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICPCES.2010.5698623","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power, Control and Embedded Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPCES.2010.5698623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698599","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power, Control and Embedded Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686263/5698599/05698623.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of RBF and MLP neural networks in short-term traffic flow forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698623/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of RBF and MLP neural networks in short-term traffic flow forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5698623/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11763580","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of RBF and MLP neural networks in short-term traffic flow forecasting","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"finalpaper137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048923S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686263","isNumber":"5698599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686263","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5698599","articleId":"5698623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5698625,"authors":[{"name":"K Sundareswaran","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Sundareswaran","id":"37324051600"},{"name":"B Hariharan","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"B","lastName":"Hariharan","id":"37085946577"},{"name":"Fawas Palasseri Parasseri","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Fawas Palasseri","lastName":"Parasseri","id":"37992298800"},{"name":"Daniel Sanju Antony","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Daniel Sanju","lastName":"Antony","id":"37998063700"},{"name":"Binyamin Subair","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Binyamin","lastName":"Subair","id":"37992302200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8542-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8543-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8541-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5698625","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":539},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Static VAr compensators","Flexible AC transmission systems","Stability criteria","Optimization","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","power system stability","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal placement","static VAr compensators","particle swarm optimization","IEEE 30 bus system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FACTS","PSO","SVC","Voltage Stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698625","abstract":"The identification of optimal locations for 3 Static VAr Compensators (SVC's) in an IEEE 30 bus system is considered in this paper.

For Satellites, the smallest category envisioned is the \u201cfemptosat\u201d which would weigh less than one-tenth of a kilogram, a satellite that would handle very simple missions and would be implemented on a single chip. One of the elementary things required in these satellites is the Satellite Attitude Determination System. The Satellite Attitude Determination system requires the calculation of sine and cosine values with good accuracy. Normally these values are calculated using a software. In this paper using Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm we propose an architecture for the calculation of sine and cosine values which is much faster than the software counterpart and also occupies very small area on the chip. This architecture is also suitable for systems like calculator where the chip count has to be reduced. Also this approach uses a very small lookup table resulting into very small memory requirement.","doi":"10.1109/ICPCES.2010.5698645","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power, Control and Embedded Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power, Control and Embedded Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5686263/5698599/05698645.pdf","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPCES.2010.5698645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5698645/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of sine and cosine value generators using Cordic Algorithm for Satellite Attitude Determination and calculators","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5698645/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11763596","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of sine and cosine value generators using Cordic Algorithm for Satellite Attitude Determination and calculators","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"finalpaper177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06473S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5686263","isNumber":"5698599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5686263","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5698599","articleId":"5698645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5698647,"authors":[{"name":"Tarun Varshney","affiliation":["Electronics and Institute Engineering MIT, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Tarun","lastName":"Varshney","id":"37992144500"},{"name":"Satya Sheel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, MNNIT, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Satya","lastName":"Sheel","id":"37993766300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8542-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8543-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8541-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5698647","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Function approximation","Graphical user interfaces","Approximation algorithms","Training","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","function approximation","graphical user interfaces","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D function approximation","GUI system development","feed forward neural network","graphical user interface","Levenberg Marquardt back propagation","training algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Function approximation","GUI","Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm","multilayer neural network","MISO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5698647","abstract":"This paper demonstrates the function approximation capability of feed forward neural network (FFNN).

Parameters of neural network can be set from a single panel. This GUI system provides approximation for various functions which made this GUI universal for the wide range of the users without theoretical knowledge about the function approximation. A Neural network with a single hidden layer has been used to approximate the functions. To train the neural network various type of learning algorithms has been accumulated in GUI system.

But in few conditions such as in fault conditions, SSR phenomenon takes place which can damage the turbine generator shaft.

There exist many distortion measures in the literature which are often validated by comparing them to the human appreciation of the image quality, in particular the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Until now, we do not know precisely which factors intervene into the human evaluation of the image quality. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question. We study a set of indicators and see what are the most relevant for the image quality assessment by using an Artificial Neural Network based model. The variable selection system results in defining the image indicators that convey relevant information for the subjective evaluation of image quality.","doi":"10.1109/EUVIP.2010.5699110","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684397/5698737/05699110.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP)","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUVIP.2010.5699110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5698737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable selection for image quality assessment using a Neural Network based approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Variable selection for image quality assessment using a Neural Network based approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11773024","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5699110/","conferenceDate":"5-6 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable selection for image quality assessment using a Neural Network based approach","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067462S","chronDate":"5-6 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684397","isNumber":"5698737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684397","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5698737","articleId":"5699110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5699127,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The functionality and design techniques are demonstrated through an efficient implementation of colour space conversion (CSC) intellectual property (IP) core used in many image processing applications such as compression. Furthermore, an evaluation and application flow example are presented for the CSC core. The evaluation of the proposed approach has shown the important features such as the flexibility, application connectivity, standardised interfaces, host applications and DPR area/size placement. Results obtained reveal that the proposed environment offers a better design and implementation solution using a scriptable program to establish communication between the field programmable gate array (FPGA) with IP cores such as CSC and their application, power consumption estimation for partial reconfiguration area and automatically generated the partial and initial bitstreams. The design exploration offered by the proposed DPR environment allows the generation of optimised CSC IP core in terms of area/speed ratio.

Fabricating these 3D-SICs using Wafer-to-Wafer (W2W) stacking has several advantages including: high throughput, thin wafer and small die handling, and high TSV density. However, W2W stacking suffers from low compound yield. This paper investigates various matching processes by using different wafer matching criteria in order to maximize the compound yield. It first establishes a framework covering different matching processes and wafer matching criteria for both replenished and non-replenished wafer repositories. Thereafter, a subset of the framework is analyzed. The simulation results show that the compound yield not only depends on the number of stacked dies, die yield, and repository size, but it also strongly depends on the used matching process and the wafer matching criteria. Moreover, by choosing an appropriate wafer matching scenario (e.g., wafer matching process, criterion etc.), the compound yield can be improved up to 13.4% relative to random W2W stacking.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684496/5699173/05699218.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Test Conference","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2010.5699218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2010.5699218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On maximizing the compound yield for 3D Wafer-to-Wafer stacked ICs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compounds","Stacking","Three dimensional displays","Bonding","Containers","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D wafer-to-wafer stacked IC","heterogeneous integration","wafer matching criteria","nonreplenished wafer repositories","stacked dies","repository size","TSV density","die handling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D integration","wafer matching","matching criteria","compound yield","wafer-to-wafer stacking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"On maximizing the compound yield for 3D Wafer-to-Wafer stacked ICs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699218/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773210","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On maximizing the compound yield for 3D Wafer-to-Wafer stacked ICs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121623S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684496","isNumber":"5699173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684496","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5699173","articleId":"5699218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699219,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Noia","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Noia","id":"37400445900"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"},{"name":"Erik Jan Marinissen","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Erik Jan","lastName":"Marinissen","id":"37273353200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7207-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7206-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7205-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"CD","value":"1089-3539"}],"articleNumber":"5699219","dbTime":"135 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":601},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699219","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Testing","Pins","Through-silicon vias","Schedules","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","integrated circuit design","logic circuits","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization methods","post-bond die-internal-external testing","3D stacked IC","three-dimensional stacked IC","test-architecture optimization","multiple partial stacks","single final stack test","TSV testing","die-external logic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEST.2010.5699219","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684496/5699173/05699219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2010.5699219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization methods for post-bond die-internal/external testing in 3D stacked ICs","abstract":"Testing of three-dimensional (3D) stacked ICs (SICs) is starting to receive considerable attention in the semiconductor industry.

We address the problem of test-architecture optimization for 3D stacked ICs to minimize overall test time when either the complete stack only, or the complete stack and multiple partial stacks, need to be tested.

In this paper, we generalize the coding problem for error detection and correction of both local (burst) and global (random) errors. We suggest using error-locality-aware codes for SRAM memories to correct single-bit or multi-bit upsets as well as physical defects. Solving the coding problem with a SAT-solver, we have found codes to correct double global or multiple (>;=3) local errors for 8, 12, 16, and 24-bit memories. For 16-bit memories, we propose a code that corrects two global or four local errors. With the same cost, our proposed code provides extra reliability than double-error-correcting BCH code. For 12-bit memories, we suggest a code that corrects two global or five local errors and has the same cost as triple-error-correcting Golay code but provides better reliability against multi-bit upsets. For memories of other widths, using syndrome analysis, we demonstrate the possibility of designing codes to correct any arbitrary number of local and global errors.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699173","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684496/5699173/05699220.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2010.5699220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2010.5699220","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-locality-aware linear coding to correct multi-bit upsets in SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699220/","displayDocTitle":"Error-locality-aware linear coding to correct multi-bit upsets in SRAMs","htmlLink":"/document/5699220/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11773212","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-locality-aware linear coding to correct multi-bit upsets in SRAMs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.174576S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684496","isNumber":"5699173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684496","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5699173","articleId":"5699220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699221,"authors":[{"name":"Rudrajit Datta","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Center, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rudrajit","lastName":"Datta","id":"37575455600"},{"name":"Nur A.

The defect map is obtained from a memory characterization test which identifies which cells are defective or marginal. The idea proposed here is that if a general t-bit error correcting code is implemented in hardware and requires c\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">full</sub>\n=n-k check bits for k information bits, then once the defect map is known, the defective cells become erasures w.r.t. the ECC. This fact can be used to select only a subset of the n-k rows in the H-matrix which are sufficient to provide the desired error detection/correction capability in the presences of the known erasures. By selectively reducing the number of rows in the H-matrix, the number of check bits that are actually stored and used, c\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">used</sub>\n, can be restricted and the corresponding unused ECC hardware disabled. This reduces the check bit storage requirements and hence frees up more of the cache for storing data and improving performance. This strategy is applied to the problem of providing reliable cache operation in ultra-low voltage modes, and results indicate that with the proposed post-manufacturing ECC customization, a fraction of the number of check bits are required compared to using a full OLS code for handling a particular defect rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773213","htmlLink":"/document/5699221/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Post-manufacturing ECC customization based on Orthogonal Latin Square codes and its application to ultra-low power caches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post-manufacturing ECC customization based on Orthogonal Latin Square codes and its application to ultra-low power caches","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068966S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684496","isNumber":"5699173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684496","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5699173","articleId":"5699221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5699224,"authors":[{"name":"Devin Morris","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Devin","lastName":"Morris","id":"37679565500"},{"name":"William R.

The existing built-in self-test (BIST) methods work by incrementing the clock frequency until timing failures occur within the combinational circuit-under-test (CUT). A standing challenge for industrial adoption of post-silicon device profiling by this method is the time required for the characterization process. To perform rapid and accurate delay characterization, we introduce a number of techniques to rapidly scan the CUTs while changing the clock frequency using off-chip and on-chip clock synthesis modules. We next find a compact parametric representation of the CUT timing failure probability. Using this representation, the minimum number of frequency samples is determined to accurately estimate the delay for each CUT within the 2D FPGA array. After that, we exploit the spatial correlation of the delays across the FPGA die to measure a small subset of CUT delays from an array of CUTs and recover the remaining entries with high accuracy. Our implementation and evaluations on Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA demonstrate that the combination of the new techniques reduces the characterization timing overhead by at least three orders of magnitude while simultaneously reducing the required storage requirements.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5684496/5699173/05699248.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid FPGA delay characterization using clock synthesis and sparse sampling","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2010.5699248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2010.5699248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Rapid FPGA delay characterization using clock synthesis and sparse sampling","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773240","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5699248/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid FPGA delay characterization using clock synthesis and sparse sampling","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109212S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684496","isNumber":"5699173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684496","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5699173","articleId":"5699248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699271,"authors":[{"name":"Ender Yilmaz","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ender","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37393170600"},{"name":"Sule Ozev","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Sule","lastName":"Ozev","id":"37275335200"},{"name":"Kenneth M.

During production ramp up, most of these tests are dropped using statistical analysis techniques based on the dropout patterns. While effective in reducing the number of tests, this approach treats each device in an identical manner. As the statistical diversity of the devices increases due to increasing process variations, such homogeneous testing approaches may prove to be inefficient. After a number of initial measurements, device-specific information is available, which can provide clues as to where in the process space that device falls. Using this information, the test set for each device can be tailored with respect to its own statistical information. In this paper, we present an adaptive test flow for mixed-signal circuits that aims at optimizing the test set per-device basis so that more test resources can be devoted to marginal devices whereas devices that fall in the middle of the process space are passed with less testing. We also include provisions to identify potentially defective devices and test them more extensively since these devices do not conform to learned collective information. We conduct experiments on an LNA circuit in simulations and apply our techniques to production data of two distinct industrial circuits. Both the simulation results and the results on large-scale production data show that adaptive test provides the best trade-off between test time and test quality as measured in terms of defective parts per million.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5699271/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773263","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive test flow for mixed-signal/RF circuits using learned information from device under test","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive test flow for mixed-signal/RF circuits using learned information from device under test","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070936S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5684496","isNumber":"5699173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5684496","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5699173","articleId":"5699271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5699272,"authors":[{"name":"Dzmitry Maliuk","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Maliuk","id":"37545633900"},{"name":"Haralampos-G.

In essence, the neural network implements a non-linear classifier which can be trained to map directly sensor-based measurements to the Go/No-Go test decision. The neural network is fabricated as a single chip and is put to the test to recognize faulty from functional RF LNA instances. Its decision is based on the readings of two amplitude detectors that are connected to the input and output ports of the RF LNA.

Communication constraints impose that, per transmission, only one node can access the network and send its information. The order in which nodes send their information is orchestrated by a network protocol, such as, the Round-Robin (RR) and the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocol. In this paper, we generalize the mentioned protocols to novel classes of so-called \u201cperiodic\u201d and \u201cquadratic\u201d protocols. By focusing on linear plants and controllers, we present a modeling framework for NCSs based on discrete-time switched linear uncertain systems. This framework allows the controller to be given in discrete time as well as in continuous time. To analyze stability of such systems for a range of possible transmission intervals and delays, with a possible nonzero lower bound, we propose a new procedure to obtain a convex overapproximation in the form of a polytopic system with norm-bounded additive uncertainty. We show that this approximation can be made arbitrarily tight in an appropriate sense. Based on this overapproximation, we derive stability results in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). We illustrate our stability analysis on the benchmark example of a batch reactor and show how this leads to tradeoffs between different protocols, allowable ranges of transmission intervals and delays. In addition, we show that the exploitation of the linearity of the system and controller leads to a significant reduction in conservatism with respect to existing approaches in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6011601/05699348.pdf","startPage":"2101","endPage":"2115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2107631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2107631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Analysis of Networked Control Systems Using a Switched Linear Systems Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Delay","Switches","Uncertain systems","Stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","delays","discrete time systems","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","networked control systems","stability","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","networked control systems","switched linear system approach","time-varying transmission intervals","time-varying transmission delays","network protocol","Round-Robin protocol","try-once-discard protocol","linear plants","linear controllers","discrete-time switched linear uncertain systems","convex overapproximation","polytopic system","linear matrix inequalities","batch reactor","periodic protocols","quadratic protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication constraints","networked control systems (NCSs)","stability","switched systems","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis of Networked Control Systems Using a Switched Linear Systems Approach","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5699348/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12216391","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis of Networked Control Systems Using a Switched Linear Systems Approach","sourcePdf":"tac-donkers-2107631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140733S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6011601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"381","xplore-issue":"6011601","articleId":"5699348","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5699350,"authors":[{"name":"Vikash Gilja","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and SINTN, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vikash","lastName":"Gilja","id":"37322499400"},{"name":"Cindy A.

Intracortical electrode arrays measure action potentials and local field potentials from individual neurons, or small populations of neurons, in the motor cortices and can provide considerable information for controlling prostheses. Despite several compelling proof-of-concept laboratory animal experiments and an initial human clinical trial, at least three key challenges remain which, if left unaddressed, may hamper the translation of these systems into widespread clinical use. We review these challenges: achieving able-bodied levels of performance across tasks and across environments, achieving robustness across multiple decades, and restoring able-bodied quality proprioception and somatosensation. We also describe some emerging opportunities for meeting these challenges. If these challenges can be largely or fully met, intracortically based neural prostheses may achieve true clinical viability and help increasing numbers of disabled patients.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2107553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5895009/05699350.pdf","startPage":"1891","endPage":"1899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2107553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges and Opportunities for Next-Generation Intracortically Based Neural Prostheses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699350/","displayDocTitle":"Challenges and Opportunities for Next-Generation Intracortically Based Neural Prostheses","volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063158","pubMedId":"21257365","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699350/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges and Opportunities for Next-Generation Intracortically Based Neural Prostheses","sourcePdf":"tbme-shenoy-2107553-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.249203S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5895009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5895009","articleId":"5699350","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5699354,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Jen Hsu","affiliation":["Columbia Laboratory of Unconventional Electronics, Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5718234/5699354/5699354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Jen Hsu (S'08) received the M.S. degree in applied mechanics from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2006.

We have used organic field-effect transistors, which are compatible with the low Curie temperature of a flexible piezoelectric polymer, i.e., PVDF, to monolithically fabricate transimpedance amplifiers directly on the sensor surface and convert the piezoelectric charge signal into a current signal, which can be detected even in the presence of parasitic capacitance. The device couples the voltage generated by the PVDF film under strain into the gate of organic thin-film transistors using an arrangement that allows the full piezoelectric voltage to couple to the channel while also increasing charge-retention time. A bipolar detector is created using ultraviolet-ozone treatment to shift the threshold voltage and increase the current of the transistor under both compressive and tensile strain. An array of devices that maps the strain field on a PVDF film surface is demonstrated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strain","Logic gates","OFETs","Robot sensing systems","Substrates","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","Curie temperature","operational amplifiers","organic field effect transistors","piezoelectric transducers","strain sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strain sensor","piezoelectric polymer","organic field-effect transistor","piezoelectric sensor","passive array","array-based polyvinylidene difluoride","PVDF sensor","low Curie temperature","transimpedance amplifier","sensor surface","piezoelectric charge signal","current signal","parasitic capacitance","PVDF film","organic thin-film transistor","piezoelectric voltage","charge-retention time","bipolar detector","ultraviolet-ozone treatment","threshold voltage","compressive strain","tensile strain","strain field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFETs","piezoelectric","sensors","strain"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TED.2010.2102631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5718234/05699354.pdf","startPage":"910","endPage":"917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5718234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2010.2102631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Locally Amplified Strain Sensor Based on a Piezoelectric Polymer and Organic Field-Effect Transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Locally Amplified Strain Sensor Based on a Piezoelectric Polymer and Organic Field-Effect Transistors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699354/","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699354/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11833812","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Locally Amplified Strain Sensor Based on a Piezoelectric Polymer and Organic Field-Effect Transistors","sourcePdf":"ted-hsu-2102631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042946S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5718234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5718234","articleId":"5699354","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5699360,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias D.

The use of multiple disparate sonars allows one to exploit a high-resolution sonar with good target definition while taking advantage of the clutter suppression abilities of a low-resolution broadband (BB) sonar coregistered over the same region to provide much better detection performance comparing to those of the single-sonar cases. In this paper, the standard Neyman-Pearson detector is extended to the dual disparate sonar case allowing target detection across two sensory channels simultaneously. A novel distributed detection system is also developed that exploits the use of multiple dual-sonar detectors for multiplatform target detection. Test results of the proposed detection methods are also presented on an underwater synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery database containing data from three different imaging sonars operating at three different frequencies and resolutions. Test results illustrating the effectiveness of different coherent-based detection systems will be presented and benchmarked against those of two other detection methods in terms of probability of detection, false alarm rate, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Performance gains of about 23% in probability of detection were achieved over the benchmarked methods.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2010.2094230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5732754/05699365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2010.2094230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5732754","startPage":"37","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherence-Based Underwater Target Detection From Multiple Disparate Sonar Platforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coherence-Based Underwater Target Detection From Multiple Disparate Sonar Platforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699365/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11883046","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5699365/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherence-Based Underwater Target Detection From Multiple Disparate Sonar Platforms","sourcePdf":"joe-tucker-2094230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076727S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5732754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5732754","articleId":"5699365","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5699377,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Huang","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5773659/5699377/5699377-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Huang received the B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree from the University of Notre Dame (ND), Notre Dame, IN, in 2010, all in electrical engineering.","He was a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Electrical Engineering, ND, from January 2008 to December 2008.

The number of pulses in the waveform is equal to the number of Nyquist samples and the peak constraint is independent of whether the waveform is two-level or three-level. The proof of the sampling theorem uses a simple iterative technique that is guaranteed to converge to the exact PWM representation whenever it exists. The paper goes on to develop a practical matrix based iterative technique to generate the PWM waveform that is guaranteed to converge exponentially. The peak constraint in the theorem is only a sufficient condition. In fact, many signals with higher peaks, e.g., lower than Nyquist frequency sinusoids, can be accurately represented by a PWM waveform.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2094350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2094350","startPage":"1178","endPage":"1190","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5773659/05699377.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5773659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sampling Theorem With Constant Amplitude Variable Width Pulses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"The Sampling Theorem With Constant Amplitude Variable Width Pulses","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2011","volume":"58","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699377/","accessionNumber":"12023253","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699377/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Sampling Theorem With Constant Amplitude Variable Width Pulses","sourcePdf":"tcsi-huang-2094350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068061S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5773659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5773659","articleId":"5699377","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5699378,"authors":[{"name":"Jingbo Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6097172/5699378/5699378-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingbo Jiang received the B.Sc. degree in automation and the M.Sc. degree in control theory and engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2010.","He is currently with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta.

Both open- and closed-loop data are used to tune the scaling factors of the nonlinear model. The effectiveness of the model is validated over a large temperature range with the experimental data from a thermal cycling application of the Peltier device used to perform the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a genetic amplification technique having important medical diagnostic applications. Based on the theoretical model, two novel nonlinear controllers are designed for a PCR cycling temperature profile. The first controller is an extension of conventional input-to-state feedback linearization design to a class of nonlinear systems that is not only affine on the control but also affine on the square of control inputs. The desired performance is achieved by tuning the parameters to control the convergent rates of the tracking errors. The second one is a switching controller design, which switches between a nonlinear pseudo-proportional-integral-differential (PID)/state feedback controller and a linear time-invariant proportional-integral (PI)/state feedback controller. A Lyapunov function method is used to develop the algorithm for the nonlinear controller, whose parameter values at the switching time are used in the linear controller. Such a combination of linear and nonlinear controllers could reduce the calculation burden and minimize the steady-state errors. Both controllers are tested with our simulation model and implemented in a microcontroller. We verified the designs with improved temperature tracking performances compared to our earlier linear switching design on reduced overshoots (<; 0.5 \u00b0C) and settling time (8-10 s faster). The modeling methodology and the feedback linearization-based controller design are scalable and both nonlinear designs can avoid future local model identifications when applied to different references, therefore, are easily extended to other thermal applications.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2010.2099660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2010.2099660","startPage":"11","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6097172/05699378.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6097172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Controller Designs for Thermal Management in PCR Amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Controller Designs for Thermal Management in PCR Amplification","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699378/","accessionNumber":"12409560","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699378/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Controller Designs for Thermal Management in PCR Amplification","sourcePdf":"tcst-jiang-2099660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112578S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6097172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6097172","articleId":"5699378","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5699386,"authors":[{"name":"David W.

The most challenging issue of producing a robotic cleaner is to maximize its coverage performance. The complete coverage performance depends on the obstacle detection sensors as well as on the navigation systems. Conventional contact, infrared, and ultrasonic sensors perform either collision-based or collision-free perceptions with obstacles, and these sensors represent a poor coverage performance when the robotic cleaner moves beside the obstacle or wall. Therefore, this paper proposes a soft-contact-based pneumatic sensor with four closed chambers to continuously contact objects with a certain level of force when the robotic cleaner touches the obstacle or wall so that the complete coverage performance could be improved. Practically, a robotic cleaner navigation system is developed using the field programmable gate array. The finite state machine is further used to model the control strategy of the navigation systems according to the sensor data and elapsed time. Finally, several experiments were evaluated based on the path of navigation and the percentage of coverage with elapsed time to verify our approaches, and the improved complete coverage performance is verified by comparing the performance of iRobot Create using the same test environments and conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5725255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5725255/05699392.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2010.2101312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2010.2101312","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pneumatic Sensor: A Complete Coverage Improvement Approach for Robotic Cleaners","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699392/","displayDocTitle":"Pneumatic Sensor: A Complete Coverage Improvement Approach for Robotic Cleaners","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699392/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11850891","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pneumatic Sensor: A Complete Coverage Improvement Approach for Robotic Cleaners","sourcePdf":"tim-kuo-2101312-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11191S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5725255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5725255","articleId":"5699392","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5699399,"authors":[{"name":"Hirofumi Akagi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6019146/5699399/5699399-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hirofumi Akagi (M\u201987\u2013SM\u201994\u2013F\u201996) was born in Okayama, Japan, in 1951.

As a result, photovoltaic (PV) energy can be easily delivered through a dc/dc converter to the FREEDM system's dc bus. The module-integrated converter (MIC) topology is a good candidate for a PV converter designed to work with the FREEDM system. This paper compares the parallel connected dc MIC structure with its counterpart, the series connected MIC architecture. From the presented analysis, the parallel connected architecture was shown to have more advantages. In this paper, a high-efficiency dual mode resonant converter topology is proposed for parallel connected dc MICs. This new resonant converter topology can change resonant modes adaptively depending on the panel operation conditions. The converter achieves zero-voltage switching for primary-side switches and zero-current switching for secondary-side diodes for both resonant modes. The circulation energy is minimized particularly for 5-50% of the rated power level. Thus, the converter can maintain a high efficiency for a wide input range at different output power levels. This study explains the operation principle of the proposed converter and presents a dc gain analysis based on the fundamental harmonic analysis method. A 240-W prototype with an embedded maximum power point tracking controller was built to evaluate the performance of the proposed converter. The prototype's maximum efficiency reaches 96.5% and an efficiency increase of more than 10% under light load conditions is shown when compared with a conventional LLC resonant converter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave integrated circuits","Converters","Topology","Renewable energy resources","Inverters","Capacitors","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","diodes","energy harvesting","energy management systems","harmonic analysis","maximum power point trackers","photovoltaic power systems","renewable energy sources","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PV module-integrated DC-DC converter","PV energy harvesting","FREEDM system","future renewable electric energy delivery and management system","DC interface","module-integrated converter topology","dual mode resonant converter topology","zero-voltage switching","primary-side switch","secondary-side diode","harmonic analysis method","maximum power point tracking controller","LLC resonant converter","photovoltaic system","smart grid","power 240 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","photovoltaic systems","smart grid","solar power generation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2107581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05699400.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2107581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Efficiency PV Module-Integrated DC/DC Converter for PV Energy Harvest in FREEDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High-Efficiency PV Module-Integrated DC/DC Converter for PV Energy Harvest in FREEDM Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699400/","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699400/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12004929","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Efficiency PV Module-Integrated DC/DC Converter for PV Energy Harvest in FREEDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-liang-2107581-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097089S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5699400","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5699401,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Roncero-Sanchez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, Control Engineering and Communications, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5871429/5699401/5699401-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pedro Roncero-S\u00e1nchez (M\u201907) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering degree from Universidad Pontificia Comillas, Madrid, Spain, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in industrial engineer from Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain, in 2004.","He is a currently Senior Lecturer at the School of Industrial Engineering, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha.

Due to the presence of disturbances in the grid voltage, such as harmonics, imbalances, noise, and offsets introduced by the instrumentation, among others, the frequency-estimation process has to be robust against all these disturbances to obtain an accurate estimation of the frequency value. This paper presents a fast and accurate method to estimate the fundamental frequency of an electric power system. The estimation method works properly in balanced and imbalanced three-phase systems, and even in single-phase systems. The proposed solution is based on an algebraic method, which is able to calculate the frequency of a pure sinusoidal signal using three samples. A filtering stage is used to increase the robustness of the algorithm against disturbances in a wide frequency range. Simulation and experimental results show the good performance of the method for single- and three-phase systems with a high level of harmonic distortion, even in the presence of amplitude, phase, and frequency changes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5699401/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047699","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust frequency-estimation method for distorted and imbalanced three-phase systems using discrete filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust frequency-estimation method for distorted and imbalanced three-phase systems using discrete filters","sourcePdf":"tpel-roncerosanchez-2107580-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125104S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5871429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5871429","articleId":"5699401","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":5699410,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongmin Kim","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5730612/5699410/5699410-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jeongmin Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

First, the dynamic equations of a power-split HEV are derived, and these equations consist of two electrically variable transmission modes and four fixed-gear modes. Using the dynamic equations, the optimal operation mode is selected from the viewpoint of the maximum available output torque with respect to the driver's demand and vehicle velocity. Next, an optimized mode selection map is constructed using optimization to minimize fuel consumption while satisfying the required wheel torque. We note that fixed-gear mode uses the fixed-gear mode 1 to implement a higher gear ratio if the vehicle speed is low and if the required output torque is large, as in a conventional automatic transmission shift map, and selects the fixed-gear mode 4 to implement a lower gear ratio if the vehicle speed is high and if the required output torque is low. A vehicle simulation was performed to verify the mode control algorithm of the two-mode HEV, and the results were compared with vehicle experimental results. The simulation results showed that the mode control strategy for the two-mode HEV gave satisfactory performance, similar to the experiment results.","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5730612/05699410.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2107564","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2107564","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699410","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Hybrid electric vehicles","Gears","Wheels","Compounds","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid electric vehicles","torque","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mode control strategy","two-mode hybrid electric vehicle","power split HEV","electrically variable transmission","fixed-gear mode","wheel torque demand","fuel consumption","dynamic equations","optimized mode selection map","automatic transmission shift map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrically variable transmission (EVT)","hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)","mode control algorithm","power split","two mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mode Control Strategy for a Two-Mode Hybrid Electric Vehicle Using Electrically Variable Transmission (EVT) and Fixed-Gear Mode","accessionNumber":"11862674","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5699410/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode Control Strategy for a Two-Mode Hybrid Electric Vehicle Using Electrically Variable Transmission (EVT) and Fixed-Gear Mode","sourcePdf":"tvt-kim-2107564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060794S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5730612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5730612","articleId":"5699410","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5699412,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Kuang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37293805500"},{"name":"Shu-Hung Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shu-Hung","lastName":"Leung","id":"37265751900"},{"name":"Xiangbin Yu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangbin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37280836300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5699412","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper presents a strategy for allocating power in both space and time for beamforming space-time-coded multiantenna systems with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) over flat and quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. We first develop a closed-form spatial-only (S-O) power allocation scheme based on a newly defined compressed signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR) criterion. The derived power allocation formula has a parameter (compression factor) that can be used to minimize the conditional bit error rate (BER). The BER performance of the new CSNR-based power allocation scheme is almost identical to the previous optimal S-O power allocation schemes, whereas its computation is more efficient. Using the CSNR-based power adaptation, we derive a joint spatio-temporal (S-T) power allocation method to minimize the average BER subject to a long-term (time) average of the transmit power constraint, which provides a large BER performance gain over the S-O power strategies and the existing S-T method. The practical issue of peak power constraint is also addressed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

Recently, it was shown that when there are only two users, a receiver can completely cancel the interference of the two users and provide full diversity for each user. Unfortunately, the scheme only works for two users. In this paper, we extend the scheme to more than 2 users. In other words, we propose a system to achieve interference cancellation and full diversity with low complexity for any number of users. Then, we extend the results to any number of users with any number of transmit and receive antennas. Our main idea is to design precoders, using the channel information, to make it possible for different users to transmit over orthogonal directions. Then, using the orthogonality of the transmitted signals, the receiver can separate them and decode the signals independently. We also analytically prove that our system provides full diversity to each user. Simulation results confirm our analytical proof and show that our proposed scheme outperforms other existing interference cancellation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.011811.090307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5733441/05699414.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.011811.090307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Cancellation and Detection for More than Two Users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699414/","displayDocTitle":"Interference Cancellation and Detection for More than Two Users","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11874556","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699414/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Cancellation and Detection for More than Two Users","sourcePdf":"901-tc1103-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189841S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5733441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5733441","articleId":"5699414","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699415,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310837800"},{"name":"Lijuan Cui","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Lijuan","lastName":"Cui","id":"37307460600"},{"name":"Samuel Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37276497200"},{"name":"Yan Zhai","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37278658200"},{"name":"Mark Yeary","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Yeary","id":"37279024700"},{"name":"Qiang Wu","affiliation":["Soft Imaging, LLC, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37308374600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5699415","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":979},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Parity check codes","Estimation","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","AWGN channels","channel coding","decoding","parity check codes","particle filtering (numerical methods)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise adaptive LDPC decoding","particle filtering algorithm","belief propagation","low-density parity check codes","additive white Gaussian noise channels","AWGN channels","BP based LDPC decoding process","time-varying SNR online estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal processing","channel coding","estimation","adaptive decoding"]}],"abstract":"Belief propagation (BP) is a powerful algorithm to decode low-density parity check (LDPC) codes over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.

The linear precoder is designed to minimize an upper bound on the average pairwise error probability, constrained to a set of per subcarrier transmit power constraints at the CR transmitter and a set of interference power thresholds at primary user receivers. The CR transmitter exploits the knowledge of transmit and receive correlation matrices while designing the precoder. It is shown that the linear precoder design problem is convex with these constraints, and convex optimization techniques are exploited to derive an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal precoder matrices.

Simulation results show that the approximations introduced in the proposed algorithms do not result in any performance degradation, while considerably reducing the decoding complexity and latency.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.011811.090638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5733441/05699417.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.011811.090638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Linear Programming Based Decoding Algorithm for LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699417/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Linear Programming Based Decoding Algorithm for LDPC Codes","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11874558","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699417/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Linear Programming Based Decoding Algorithm for LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"740-tc1103-nkou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063971S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5733441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5733441","articleId":"5699417","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699418,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Song","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5713793/5699418/5699418-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Song received his B.A.Sc in Mathematics at Fudan University, China in 2005.

However, the exact closed form of PDF is extremely difficult to obtain. A general approximation method known as Moment Matching Approximating (MMA) is used to approximate the distribution of effective SNR by a simple expression. In this paper, the approximation by Gaussian, Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Pearson distribution are studied. Results show that Gaussian approximation is very useful when the number of sub-carriers is sufficiently large. Both GEV and Pearson approximation are accurate enough in approximating the distribution of effective SNR in a general case.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5713793/05699418.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.011811.100056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.011811.100056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximations of EESM Effective SNR Distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Approximation methods","Gaussian distribution","Fading","Bandwidth","Random variables","WiMAX"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","Gaussian distribution","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability density function","cumulative distribution function","signal to noise ratio","exponential effective SNR mapping","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","moment matching approximating","generalized extreme value","Pearson distribution","Gaussian approximation","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exponential effective SNR mapping (EESM)","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","moment matching approximating (MMA)","Gaussian distribution","generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution","Pearson system","channel feedback","long term evolution (LTE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Approximations of EESM Effective SNR Distribution","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5699418/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807453","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximations of EESM Effective SNR Distribution","sourcePdf":"603-tc1102-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06867S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5713793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5713793","articleId":"5699418","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5699419,"authors":[{"name":"Michael R.

For enclosure configurations that optimize heat transfer to the case, the maximum capacitor temperature can be estimated with good accuracy using analytical approximations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implications of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of capacitor windings","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MEI.2011.5699442","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/57/5699437/05699442.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEI.2011.5699442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699437","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-February  2011","displayDocTitle":"Implications of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of capacitor windings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5699442/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","publicationDate":"January-February 2011","accessionNumber":"11770019","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implications of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of capacitor windings","sourcePdf":"EIM1-007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061435S","chronDate":"January-February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"57","isNumber":"5699437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"57","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5699437","articleId":"5699442","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699446,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In previous works, we have optimized the AF relaying scheme carried on a symbol-by-symbol basis. Here, we focus on AF and Incremental AF (IAF) schemes, operating on a packet-by-packet basis. The optimization is carried out while keeping the additional multiple access interference cost, inherent to relaying, constant. For CDMA uplink communications, this cost can reliably quantify the capacity loss incurred by the use of relaying in the transmission process. We define an optimization cost constraint and propose an approach to optimize AF and IAF relaying performance in terms of Block-Error-Rate (BLER). In order to assess the performance enhancement over direct transmission of optimized relaying schemes and compare AF and IAF, we have carried numerous simulations results.","doi":"10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699803","publicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685627/5699701/05699803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699701","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet-wise AF and Incremental AF performance optimization for uplink CDMA communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Packet-wise AF and Incremental AF performance optimization for uplink CDMA communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699803/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773989","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5699803/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet-wise AF and Incremental AF performance optimization for uplink CDMA communications","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071662S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5699805,"authors":[{"name":"Rahma Bouraoui","affiliation":["Research Unit TECHTRA, SUPCOM, Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Rahma","lastName":"Bouraoui","id":"37999261300"},{"name":"Sameh Najeh","affiliation":["Research Unit TECHTRA, SUPCOM, Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sameh","lastName":"Najeh","id":"37397600200"},{"name":"Hichem Besbes","affiliation":["Research Unit TECHTRA, SUPCOM, Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Hichem","lastName":"Besbes","id":"37269436900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699805","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"abstract":"Cognitive radio is an emerging research topic aiming to improve spectrum usage. This paper deals with resource allocation problem in OFDMA cognitive radio systems. Previous research that has dealt with this problem assume perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) and few works consider the quality of the spectrum sensing in the resource allocation issue. The proposed approach combines both partial CSI and raw sensing information (RSI), in order to offer a better compromise between the throughput and the quality of service (QoS) of the secondary system. The proposed algorithm is a sub-optimal low complex algorithm based on two steps. Simulations were drawn to evaluate the performance of this algorithm in terms of achievable data rate, power consumption, generated interference and QoS of the secondary users.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685627/5699701/05699805.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation of OFDMA based cognitive radio systems under partial channel state information and raw sensing information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Sensors","Channel estimation","Interference","Quality of service","Receivers","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDM","cognitive radio system","partial channel state information","raw sensing information","spectrum sensing","quality of service","power consumption","suboptimal low complex algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","OFDMA system","Partial Channel State Information","Raw sensing Information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation of OFDMA based cognitive radio systems under partial channel state information and raw sensing information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11792045","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation of OFDMA based cognitive radio systems under partial channel state information and raw sensing information","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070395S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699806,"authors":[{"name":"Le\u00efla Najjar Atallah","affiliation":["Laboratory TECHTRA, Higher School of Communication of Tunis (SupCom), Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Le\u00efla","lastName":"Najjar Atallah","id":"37279300000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699806","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"abstract":"In the frame of block pilot channel estimation, an ameliorated version of the Least Squares (LS) algorithm is here proposed for OFDM systems. Former studies use the fact that the cyclic prefix (CP) duration upper bounds the length of the channel impulse response (CIR) to cancel the estimation noise lying outside the CIR first taps, equal in number to the CP samples. However, if the channel is sparse, the number of non zero coefficients is a small fraction of the channel length. This results in an important residual estimation noise and a further enhancement is possible. We propose to first derive the CIR structure by the effective taps localization. Then, an adequately chosen LS criterion is optimized to estimate the CIR. The CIR structure is derived by a computationally efficient probabilistic framework estimator (PFE). The PFE operates a non iterative thresholding on the LS estimate of the CIR to classify the taps into effective taps and zero taps. The thresholds are chosen such that the sum of false detection probability and of missing probability is minimized. Compared to former algorithms, the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of channel frequency response (CFR) estimate mean square error (MSE). It also leads to symbol error rates equivalent to those obtained with perfect channel knowledge.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685627/5699701/05699806.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient structured estimator of sparse channels for OFDM communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference suppression","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structured estimator","sparse channel","OFDM communication","block pilot channel estimation","least squares algorithm","cyclic prefix","channel impulse response","CIR","estimation noise cancellation","probabilistic framework estimator","PFE","false detection probability","missing probability","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse channel","structured estimation","zero taps detection","probability of missing","probability of false alarm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An efficient structured estimator of sparse channels for OFDM communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699806/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11792048","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient structured estimator of sparse channels for OFDM communications","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048798S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699808,"authors":[{"name":"Le\u00efla Nasraoui","affiliation":["TECHTRA Laboratory, Higher School of Communications, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Le\u00efla","lastName":"Nasraoui","id":"37846547600"},{"name":"Le\u00efla Najjar Najjar Atallah","affiliation":["TECHTRA Laboratory, Higher School of Communications, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Le\u00efla Najjar","lastName":"Najjar Atallah","id":"37279300000"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["MEDIATRON Laboratory, Higher School of Communications, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699808","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme using a new single-symbol preamble structure for OFDM data-aided synchronization. The preamble symbol is constituted of two successive equal-duration sub-symbols, the second one of which is a differentially encoded version of the first one, using an adequately designed precoding sequence. This structure leads to almost perfect channel autocorrelation profile with sharp in-phase peak and zero out-of-phase correlation. For comparison, we review some previous methods also based on data-aided synchronization for OFDM systems. We here explore the performance of the new method in the case of the AWGN channel. The performance is presented in terms of correct frame start detection rate and estimator's variance for time estimation. For fractional frequency offset estimation, the performance is evaluated in terms of mean squared error. The obtained results prove that the accuracy of the frame start detection and the fractional frequency offset estimation are greatly enhanced, even at very low SNRs. We show that compared to the best benchmark, gains of about 5 dB and 20 dB are achieved for timing precision of one sample and of one tenth of a sample, respectively. We also show that for a target correct detection rate of 95%, our approach provides more than 17 dB gain with respect to the best benchmark. Although we concentrate here on OFDM, the proposed approach can be applied to other systems such as TDMA or CDMA.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685627/5699701/05699808.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A very efficient time and frequency synchronization method for OFDM systems operating in AWGN channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Estimation","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","frequency estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","precoding","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synchronization me","OFDM systems","AWGN channels","single-symbol preamble structure","OFDM data-aided synchronization","successive equal-duration subsymbols","precoding sequence","channel autocorrelation profile","zero out-of-phase correlation","sharp in-phase peak correlation","frame start detection rate","estimator variance","time estimation","fractional frequency offset estimation","mean squared error","TDMA","CDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","preamble-based synchronization","precoding","preferred pair of m-sequence","time synchronization","frequency synchronization","preamble sequence design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A very efficient time and frequency synchronization method for OFDM systems operating in AWGN channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699808/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773983","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A very efficient time and frequency synchronization method for OFDM systems operating in AWGN channels","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055481S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5699809,"authors":[{"name":"Mustapha Amara","affiliation":["RESA/WIN, Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Mustapha","lastName":"Amara","id":"38277176800"},{"name":"Yi Yuan-Wu","affiliation":["RESA/WIN, Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"lastName":"Yi Yuan-Wu","id":"38338950600"},{"name":"Dirk Slock","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Slock","id":"37079237600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699809","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","iterative methods","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed form","iterative MU-MIMO precoders","broadcast channel configurations","SDMA","space division multiple access","basic linear precoding schemes","iterative precoding techniques","Rayleigh channel","beamforming design","line of sight","TDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-user","MIMO","SDMA","Broadcast channel","Capacity","SJNR","Iterative","MMSE","Rician","Rayleigh","TDMA"]}],"abstract":"We investigate in this paper the performance achieved by some SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access) access techniques in a Broadcast channel configuration. The study includes the two basic linear precoding schemes present in the literature namely the CF (Closed Form) and the Iterative precoding techniques. These techniques have already been widely studied for the i.i.d Rayleigh channel. In fact, these precoding methods are essentially based on the exploitation of diversity created by multipaths present in such a channel to enhance the beamforming design and consequently increase the SINR (Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio) for each user. In this work the impact of a reduction of these degrees of freedom has been investigated through simulations under other channel configurations. The obtained results demonstrate that these precoding techniques remain efficient only for systems offering high number of degrees of freedom and fail when a direct LOS (Line Of Sight) is present limiting the achievable Sum Rate (SR) of the system. The obtained results have also been compared to the TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) communication mode.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Closed Form and Iterative MU-MIMO precoders for different broadcast channel configurations","publicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699809","displayPublicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685627/5699701/05699809.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Closed Form and Iterative MU-MIMO precoders for different broadcast channel configurations","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699809/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773991","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Closed Form and Iterative MU-MIMO precoders for different broadcast channel configurations","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06167S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699812,"authors":[{"name":"Ghayet El Mouna Zhioua","affiliation":["MEDIATRON, Sup'Com, Tunis, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Ghayet El Mouna","lastName":"Zhioua"},{"name":"Soumaya Hamouda","affiliation":["InfRes, Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France","MEDIATRON Sup'Com, Tunis, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Soumaya","lastName":"Hamouda","id":"37644766400"},{"name":"Philippe Godlewski","affiliation":["Mediatron, SUPCOM, Tunis, Tunisia","InfRes Telecom, ParisTech, Paris, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Godlewski","id":"37298520700"},{"name":"Sami Tabbane","affiliation":["MEDIATRON Sup'Com, Tunis, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Tabbane","id":"37282329300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699812","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":501},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new dynamic frequency assignment scheme for femtoCells in OFDMA networks. The femtoCell base stations are small cellular base stations specially designed to improve the poor indoor coverage and increase the system capacity for cellular and wireless broadband networks. However, these femto-base stations cause harmful interference to the macroCells. Therefore, the optimization of the radio resource allocation to femtoCells is essential to decrease the femtoCell to macroCell interferences and to offer better QoS for both femtoCell and macroCell users. Our dynamic frequency assignment scheme is based on sharing the same radio resources with macroCells which avoids resources' waste while condemning particular channels to femtoCells' deployment. Moreover, our scheme assigns the \u201cquietest\u201d channels to femtoCells according to the received power level. Hence, femto-BSs and macro-BSs radio resources' share could be achieved without introducing serious interference. Simulation results show the efficiency of our frequency assignment scheme. The average achievable throughput of both macroCell and femtoCell users is increased by more than 20% when compared to that obtained under a common assignment scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685627/5699701/05699812.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A femtocells ressources allocation scheme in OFDMA based networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Macrocell networks","Bandwidth","OFDM","Throughput","Interference","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtoCells resources allocation scheme","OFDMA based networks","closed access mode","femtocells' deployment","femtoCell base stations","cellular base stations","cellular networks","wireless broadband networks","femto-base stations","macroCells","radio resource allocation","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FemtoCells","Closed Access mode","Radio resource allocation","OFDMA networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A femtocells ressources allocation scheme in OFDMA based networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699812/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773999","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A femtocells ressources allocation scheme in OFDMA based networks","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072351S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5699815,"authors":[{"name":"Anis Jdidi","affiliation":["Telecom SudParis; UMR CNRS SAMOVAR, Institut Telecom, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Anis","lastName":"Jdidi","id":"37399480300"},{"name":"Tijani Chahed","affiliation":["Telecom SudParis; UMR CNRS SAMOVAR, Institut Telecom, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Tijani","lastName":"Chahed","id":"37280007900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699815","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Constellation diagram","Encoding","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical modulation","OFDMA-based networks","proportional fair algorithm","PF algorithm","opportunistic resource allocation","spectral efficiency","system throughput","cyclic round robin mechanism","wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Proportional fair","Round robin","Hierarchical","modulation","OFDMA"]}],"abstract":"Proportional Fair (PF) algorithm is known to achieve a good trade-off between efficiency and fairness by allocation opportunistically resources to users with good radio conditions, without sacrificing fairness considerations towards the other users of the system.

Vehicular networks can support both Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communications, and are targeted at the delivery of both road safety applications and non-safety applications, including comfort applications. Comfort applications aim to provide information and entertainment to people on traveling. These applications are typically bandwidth-demanding, have real time delivery requirements, and ask for the network capability to offer continuous access to the Internet together with a controlled Quality of service (QoS). To better cope with the dynamic nature of this network, the IEEE 802.11p has been proposed as a draft amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard. Its core mechanism is based on the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) for QoS management. VANET-to-Internet access needs the cooperation of certain elements of the network to serve as gateways, to choose the optimal route for them and maintain it, and to ensure users preferences and requirements of QoS. One of the challenges in VANET-to-Internet communication is how to provide connection in areas where no gateways are available. In this paper, we introduce a new QoS framework to ensure data forwarding to Internet in gateway-free area. It consists of a Proxy-based Vehicle to Internet (PVI) protocol, with a Prediction-based Routing (PBR) algorithm and IEEE 802.11p EDCA scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699820/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11773995","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699820/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A proxy-based framework for QoS-enabled Internet access in VANETS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proxy-based framework for QoS-enabled Internet access in VANETS","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051708S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5699828,"authors":[{"name":"Nejah Missaoui","affiliation":["LETI laboratory, ENIS Engineering School, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nejah","lastName":"Missaoui","id":"37572818800"},{"name":"In\u00e8s Kammoun","affiliation":["LETI laboratory, ENIS Engineering School, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"In\u00e8s","lastName":"Kammoun","id":"37281923800"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["SUPCOM, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699828","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Protocols","SONOS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","automatic repeat request","interference suppression","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid automatic repeat-request","truncated-HARQ","random access protocol","wireless slotted ALOHA MIMO systems","packet collision resolution","time division multiple access","spatial successive interference canceller","time slot","linear processing","Rayleigh fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-user detection","Slotted ALOHA","Space-time coding","Successive interference canceller","Throughput"]}],"abstract":"Packet collision resolution is proved to be a promising approach to improve the performance of slotted ALOHA protocol with TDMA technique. In the present paper, we propose a random access protocol that utilizes an efficient Spatial Successive Interference Canceller (SSIC) to separate collided packets for users that share the same time slot and that utilizes the benefits of retransmitted packets combining. We consider a truncated Hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ) scheme where the number of retransmissions is limited. Moreover, for the SSIC, we give a solution for the problem of very close powers of collided packets by using a simple linear processing for its initialization. We evaluate the throughput of the system over Rayleigh fading channel using the proposed protocol. The simulation results show that we obtain an efficient random access method with high throughput for wireless transmission.","doi":"10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699828","publicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685627/5699701/05699828.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A truncated-HARQ based random access protocol for wireless slotted ALOHA MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699828/","displayDocTitle":"A truncated-HARQ based random access protocol for wireless slotted ALOHA MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11773998","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699828/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A truncated-HARQ based random access protocol for wireless slotted ALOHA MIMO systems","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04156S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5699829,"authors":[{"name":"Besma Lahami","affiliation":["Higher School of Communications of Tunis, SUPCOM, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Besma","lastName":"Lahami","id":"37992884400"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["Higher School of Communications of Tunis, SUPCOM, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"},{"name":"Ines Kammoun","affiliation":["National School of Engineering of Sfax, ENIS Engineering School, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ines","lastName":"Kammoun","id":"37281923800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699829","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","OFDM","Time frequency analysis","Channel estimation","Prototypes","Interference","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel estimation","dispersive channels","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training-based channel estimation","time-frequency dispersive channel interference","Offset QAM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","next generation cellular system","frequency localized prototype function","quadrature phase component","optimum linear constraint","interference mean power","OFDM/OQAM systems","crosstalk minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","Dispersive channel","Selective channel","Dispersion factor","Crosstalk reduction","SIR"]}],"abstract":"Offset QAM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM/OQAM) is a promising technique for high data rate next generation cellular systems, operating on highly time-frequency dispersive channels. To combat dispersive channel interference, OFDM/OQAM systems allow very well time and frequency localized prototype functions. The good localization of the prototype function results from the separation of the transmission of the in-phase and quadrature phase components. Unfortunately, this separation introduces a crosstalk between these components when imperfect channel estimation is used to demodulate transmitted data. The main goal of this paper is the enhancement of channel estimation quality for OFDM/OQAM systems through the minimization of this crosstalk. Our approach consists in introducing a number of optimum linear constraints on neighbors of pilot symbols used to estimate the channel. The optimality of these components is related to a minimization of the residual interference mean power. In our study, for the representation of the signal space of our OFDM/OQAM system, we consider both square and hexagonal lattices in the time-frequency plane.","doi":"10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699829","publicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"The Second International Conference on Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685627/5699701/05699829.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNET.2010.5699829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of training-based channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM systems operating on highly time-frequency dispersive channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699829/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of training-based channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM systems operating on highly time-frequency dispersive channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11792051","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699829/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of training-based channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM systems operating on highly time-frequency dispersive channels","confLoc":"Tozeur, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042323S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5685627","isNumber":"5699701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685627","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5699701","articleId":"5699829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5699832,"authors":[{"name":"Yosra Mlayeh","affiliation":["CIRTACOM laboratory, 2088 Cit\u00e9 technologique des communications, SUPCOM, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Yosra","lastName":"Mlayeh","id":"37391532900"},{"name":"Fethi Tlili","affiliation":["CIRTACOM laboratory, 2088 Cit\u00e9 technologique des communications, SUPCOM, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Fethi","lastName":"Tlili","id":"37391535800"},{"name":"Adel Ghazel","affiliation":["CIRTACOM laboratory, 2088 Cit\u00e9 technologique des communications, SUPCOM, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Ghazel","id":"37283433500"},{"name":"Amor Nafkha","affiliation":["SCEE-IETR UMR CNRS 6164, SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Amor","lastName":"Nafkha","id":"37281704900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8840-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8839-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8838-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-663X"}],"articleNumber":"5699832","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","MIMO","OFDM","Diversity reception","Complexity theory","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiplexing","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2-norm condition number based switching algorithm","Demmel condition number based switching algorithm","MIMO OFDM systems","adaptive MIMO techniques","channel matrix","spatial multiplexing","transmit diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Transmit Diversity","Spatial Multiplexing","Matrix Condition Number"]}],"abstract":"Performances and capacity of MIMO-OFDM systems are enhanced with adaptive MIMO techniques such as Demmel condition number based switching algorithm.

By using this upper bound, closed-form bounds for the maximum achievable average rate, the outage probability and the average symbol error rate (SER), are derived. Further, asymptotic analysis on the outage probability and the average SER reveal that the diversity gain is determined by both the number of relay nodes in the system and the number of channel taps being supported by the CP length. Simulation results verify the derived closed-form analytical expressions and also the diversity gains. Asymptotic performance is also verified in practically high SNR region via Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.011811.101067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5749768/05699833.pdf","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.011811.101067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5749768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Cyclic Prefix-Based Single-Carrier Cooperative Diversity Systems with Best Relay Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699833/","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Cyclic Prefix-Based Single-Carrier Cooperative Diversity Systems with Best Relay Selection","volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11944530","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699833/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Cyclic Prefix-Based Single-Carrier Cooperative Diversity Systems with Best Relay Selection","sourcePdf":"1269-tw1104-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083672S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5749768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5749768","articleId":"5699833","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5699835,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangyuan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5749768/5699835/5699835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiangyuan Li (M'10) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from South China University of Technology (SCUT), Guangzhou, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

We study the problem of finding the optimal input covariance that maximizes the ergodic secrecy rate subject to a power constraint, where only statistical information about the eavesdropper channel is available at the transmitter. This is a non-convex optimization problem that is in general difficult to solve. Existing results address the case in which the eavesdropper or/and legitimate channels have independent and identically distributed Gaussian entries with zero mean and unit variance, i.e., the channels have trivial covariances. This paper addresses the general case in which the eavesdropper and legitimate channels have nontrivial covariances. A set of equations describing the optimal input covariance matrix are proposed along with an algorithm to obtain the solution. Based on this framework, it is shown that when full information on the legitimate channel is available to the transmitter, the optimal input covariance has always rank one. It is also shown that when only statistical information on the legitimate channel is available to the transmitter, the legitimate channel has some general non-trivial covariance and the eavesdropper channel has trivial covariance, the optimal input covariance has the same eigenvectors as the legitimate channel covariance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5749768/05699835.pdf","startPage":"1176","endPage":"1187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.011811.100356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.011811.100356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5749768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Ergodic Secrecy Rate for Gaussian MISO Wiretap Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Covariance matrix","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","concave programming","covariance matrices","Gaussian channels","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian MISO wiretap channel","ergodic secrecy rate","Gaussian multiple-input single-output wiretap channel model","transmitter","multiple antenna","legitimate receiver","eavesdropper channel","nonconvex optimization problem","independent and identically distributed Gaussian channel","trivial covariance","covariance matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","ergodic secrecy rate","MISO wiretap channel","beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"On Ergodic Secrecy Rate for Gaussian MISO Wiretap Channels","volume":"10","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5699835/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11944531","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Ergodic Secrecy Rate for Gaussian MISO Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"1176-tw1104-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086349S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5749768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5749768","articleId":"5699835","onlineDate":"20 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5699854,"authors":[{"name":"Craig Robinson","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Durham, South Road, UK"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Robinson"},{"name":"Alan Purvis","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Durham, South Road, UK"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Purvis"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-320-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5699854","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699838","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on DSP enabled Radio","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on DSP enabled Radio","doi":"10.1049/ic.2003.0306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demodulation of bluetooth GFSK signals under carrier frequency error conditions","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","pdfPath":"/iel5/5685296/5699838/05699854.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic.2003.0306","abstract":"Bluetooth, the short range wireless communications standard, operates in the unlicensed ISM frequency band at 2.4 GHz using Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation. Previous work has shown that the BER rate performance of a Bluetooth link can degrade by more than 19 dB when the transmitted carrier frequency differs from the ideal, yet is still within the limits imposed by the Bluetooth specification. Therefore a combination of demodulator and decision algorithm with adaptive thresholding which mitigates for carrier frequency errors is analysed. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated through the presentation of simulation results. An performance improvement of 13 dB for an initial carrier frequency offset of 70 kHz is reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Sept. 2003","conferenceDate":"22-23 Sept. 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Demodulation of bluetooth GFSK signals under carrier frequency error conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demodulation of bluetooth GFSK signals under carrier frequency error conditions","confLoc":"Scotland","sourcePdf":"20030306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019411S","chronDate":"22-23 Sept. 2003","isNumber":"5699838","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5685296","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5699854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5699899,"authors":[{"name":"Bobak Nazer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Bobak","lastName":"Nazer","id":"38482531700"},{"name":"Michael Gastpar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gastpar","id":"37273006200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"5699899","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":205,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5075},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Physical layer","Wireless communication","Interference","Galois fields","Receivers","Electromagnetic waveguides","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","linear codes","network coding","radio networks","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable physical layer network coding","electromagnetic signal","channel","receiver","reliable communication","wired network","linear network coding","network topology","network throughput","routing-based strategy","linear error-correcting code","transmitted signal","interference-limited wireless network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast","channel coding","digital communication","fading","interference","linear code","modulation","multiple access","multiuser channels","network coding","physical layer","wireless networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699899","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5715583/05699899.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2010.2094170","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2010.2094170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715583","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable Physical Layer Network Coding","abstract":"When two or more users in a wireless network transmit simultaneously, their electromagnetic signals are linearly superimposed on the channel. As a result, a receiver that is interested in one of these signals sees the others as unwanted interference. This property of the wireless medium is typically viewed as a hindrance to reliable communication over a network. However, using a recently developed coding strategy, interference can in fact be harnessed for network coding. In a wired network, (linear) network coding refers to each intermediate node taking its received packets, computing a linear combination over a finite field, and forwarding the outcome towards the destinations. Then, given an appropriate set of linear combinations, a destination can solve for its desired packets. For certain topologies, this strategy can attain significantly higher throughputs over routing-based strategies. Reliable physical layer network coding takes this idea one step further: using judiciously chosen linear error-correcting codes, intermediate nodes in a wireless network can directly recover linear combinations of the packets from the observed noisy superpositions of transmitted signals. Starting with some simple examples, this paper explores the core ideas behind this new technique and the possibilities it offers for communication over interference-limited wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","volume":"99","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11832542","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reliable Physical Layer Network Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable Physical Layer Network Coding","sourcePdf":"jproc-nazer-2094170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119542S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"5715583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"205","articleId":"5699899","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5699908,"authors":[{"name":"Bahadir Yildirim","affiliation":["Do\u011fu\u015f University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Bahadir","lastName":"Yildirim","id":"37352521700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5699908","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1835},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Wireless LAN","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Antenna radiation patterns","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","code division multiple access","impedance matching","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","wavelength division multiplexing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile equipment","multiband WCDMA-LAN antenna","compact WCDMA-WLAN antenna","wideband code division multiple access","metallized dielectric loading technique","FR4-type material","ceramics","multiband operation","impedance matching","radiation behavior","antenna measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic analysis","mobile antennas","multiple-band antennas"]}],"abstract":"A compact, multiband, planar, and low-profile wide- band code division multiple access (WCDMA)AVLAN antenna is presented in this letter.

Non-dominance is an inadequate strategy for convergence to the Pareto front for such problems, as almost all solutions in the population become non-dominated, resulting in loss of convergence pressure. However, for some problems, it may be possible to generate the Pareto front using only a few of the objectives, rendering the rest of the objectives redundant. Such problems may be reducible to a manageable number of relevant objectives, which can be optimized using conventional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). For dimensionality reduction, most proposals in the paper rely on analysis of a representative set of solutions obtained by running a conventional MOEA for a large number of generations, which is computationally overbearing. A novel algorithm, Pareto corner search evolutionary algorithm (PCSEA), is introduced in this paper, which searches for the corners of the Pareto front instead of searching for the complete Pareto front. The solutions obtained using PCSEA are then used for dimensionality reduction to identify the relevant objectives. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated by studying its performance on a set of benchmark test problems and two engineering examples. While the preliminary results obtained using PCSEA are promising, there are a number of areas that need further investigation. This paper provides a number of useful insights into dimensionality reduction and, in particular, highlights some of the roadblocks that need to be cleared for future development of algorithms attempting to use few selected solutions for identifying relevant objectives.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5963810/05699918.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pareto Corner Search Evolutionary Algorithm and Dimensionality Reduction in Many-Objective Optimization Problems","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2010.2093579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5963810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2010.2093579","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Pareto Corner Search Evolutionary Algorithm and Dimensionality Reduction in Many-Objective Optimization Problems","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12175394","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5699918/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pareto Corner Search Evolutionary Algorithm and Dimensionality Reduction in Many-Objective Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-singh-2093579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091116S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5963810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"5963810","articleId":"5699918","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5699920,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6021400/5699920/5699920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Zhang received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical design manufacturing and automation from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2006 and the M.Sc. degree in automotive engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2008.

The uncertain system matrices are assumed to lie in a convex polytope. The network-induced delays are time varying but within a given interval. The random data missing is characterized by the Bernoulli random binary distribution. Delay-dependent conditions for the exponential mean-square stability are first established in terms of matrix inequalities. Then, for the robust stabilization problem, the design of an SOF controller is presented by solving bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). In order to efficiently solve a nonconvex BMI, we propose an approach based on the linear matrix inequality technique. Furthermore, the developed approach is employed to design the remote proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for NCSs. The design of a digital PID controller is formulated as a synthesis problem of the SOF control via an augmentation method. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6021400/05699920.pdf","startPage":"5396","endPage":"5405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2107720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2107720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Static Output Feedback Control and Remote PID Design for Networked Motor Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear matrix inequalities","Output feedback","Delay effects","Pi control","Networked control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","bilinear systems","control system synthesis","delays","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","networked control systems","random processes","robust control","three-term control","time-varying networks","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust static output feedback control","remote PID design","networked motor systems","network-induced delays","uncertain system matrices","convex polytope","time varying delays","Bernoulli random binary distribution","mean-square stability","matrix inequalities","robust stabilization","bilinear matrix inequalities","linear matrix inequality","digital PID controller","proportional-integral-derivative controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilinear matrix inequality (BMI)","missing data","networked control systems (NCSs)","proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID)","static output feedback (SOF) control","time delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust Static Output Feedback Control and Remote PID Design for Networked Motor Systems","volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5699920/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12230345","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Static Output Feedback Control and Remote PID Design for Networked Motor Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-shi-2107720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087022S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6021400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"6021400","articleId":"5699920","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5699932,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidou Tembine","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d''Electricit\u00e9, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5956099/5699932/5699932-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamidou Tembine received two M.S. degrees from the Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, France and from Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France, both in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from University of Avignon, Avignon, France, in 2009. the Ph.D. thesis was entitled \u201cPopulation Games with Networking Applications.\u201d","From 2007 to 2009, he was a Research Assistant with the Department of Computer Science, University of Avignon, and a Teacher Assistant with Aix-marseille University, Aix-en-Provence, France.

The four-parameter representations (quaternion) are used to describe the spacecraft attitude for global representation without singularities. The attitude state (i.e., attitude and velocity) error dynamics is transformed to a double integrator dynamics with a constraint on the spacecraft attitude. With consideration of this constraint, a novel terminal sliding manifold is proposed for the spacecraft. In order to guarantee that the output of the NN used in the controller is bounded by the corresponding bound of the approximated unknown function, a switch function is applied to generate a switching between the adaptive NN control and the robust controller. Meanwhile, a CNN, whose basis functions are implemented using only desired signals, is introduced to approximate the desired nonlinear function and bounded external disturbances online, and the robust term based on the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to counteract NN approximation errors in the adaptive neural control scheme. Most importantly, the finite-time stability in both the reaching phase and the sliding phase can be guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach. Finally, numerical simulations on the attitude tracking control of spacecraft in the presence of an unknown mass moment of inertia matrix, bounded external disturbances, and control input constraints are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5699934/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12157986","pubMedId":"21266316","volume":"41","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Time Attitude Tracking Control for Spacecraft Using Terminal Sliding Mode and Chebyshev Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Time Attitude Tracking Control for Spacecraft Using Terminal Sliding Mode and Chebyshev Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zou-2101592-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101153S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5956099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"280","xplore-issue":"5956099","articleId":"5699934","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5699937,"authors":[{"name":"Abdoulaye Bagayoko","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories and ETIS ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, CNRS, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5749296/5699937/5699937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abdoulaye Bagayoko graduated from ENSEA (a leading European graduate school in electrical engineering, close to Paris, France) in 2007.

Several power control policies are investigated and the achieved primary-user mean rates are compared with these lower bounds. Specially, assuming all pairs of transmitter-receiver are achieving real-time delay-sensitive applications, we propose a novel secondary-user power control policy to ensure for both users, at a given occurrence, predefined minimum instantaneous rates. This power control uses only the secondary-user direct links gains estimations (secondary-to-secondary link and secondary-to-primary link).","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2107905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5749296/05699937.pdf","startPage":"2244","endPage":"2256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2107905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5749296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control of Spectrum-Sharing in Fading Environment With Partial Channel State Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Power Control of Spectrum-Sharing in Fading Environment With Partial Channel State Information","volume":"59","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11929923","htmlLink":"/document/5699937/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control of Spectrum-Sharing in Fading Environment With Partial Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"tsp-bagayoko-2107905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1339S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5749296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5749296","articleId":"5699937","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5699939,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Heinrich Hertz Chair of Mobile Communications, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Theoretische Informationstechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5749296/5699939/5699939-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Holger Boche (M'04\u2013SM'07\u2013F'11) received the Dipl.-Ing. and Dr.-Ing. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany, in 1990 and 1994, respectively.

It has been shown that this formation allows the birds to save energy, by taking advantage of the upwash generated by the neighboring birds. In this work we use a model for the upwash generated by a flying bird, and show that a flock of birds can self-organize into a V-formation if every bird were to process spatial and network information through an adaptive diffusive process. The diffusion algorithm requires the birds to obtain measurements of the upwash, and also to use information from neighboring birds. The result has interesting implications. First, a simple diffusion algorithm can account for self-organization in birds. The algorithm is fully distributed and runs in real time. Second, according to the model, that birds can self-organize based on the upwash generated by the other birds. Third, that some form of information sharing among birds is necessary to achieve flight formation. We also propose a modification to the algorithm that allows birds to organize into a U-formation, starting from a V-formation. We show that this type of formation leads to an equalization effect, where every bird in the flock observes approximately the same upwash.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5749296/05699944.pdf","startPage":"2038","endPage":"2051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2107907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2107907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5749296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Bird Flight Formations Using Diffusion Adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Birds","Signal processing algorithms","Least squares approximation","Biological system modeling","Atmospheric modeling","Adaptation model","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffusion","self-assembly","zoology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bird flight formations","diffusion adaptation","self-organization","V-formation","upwash","adaptive diffusive process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive networks","bird flight","distributed estimation","diffusion LMS","diffusion networks","U-formation","V-formation","self-organization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Bird Flight Formations Using Diffusion Adaptation","volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5699944/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11929927","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Bird Flight Formations Using Diffusion Adaptation","sourcePdf":"tsp-sayed-2107907-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097651S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5749296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5749296","articleId":"5699944","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5699949,"authors":[{"name":"Yuwen Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5730612/5699949/5699949-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuwen Pan received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","She is currently a Research and Development Engineer with the Wain Software Company, Ltd., Shanghai, China.

Results show that the spectrum efficiency and user fairness can be enhanced by cognitive radio techniques at the relay nodes. Iterative waterfilling and iterative multilevel waterfilling are exploited in the power allocation, and results show that optimal power allocation is achieved for the applications under study. These iterative methods are then combined with a power reallocation algorithm to further enhance spectrum utilization. A novel iterative barrier-constrained waterfilling algorithm is proposed to address the data rate limitations imposed by poor base-station-to-relay channels. The proposed technique offers fast convergence, and complexity is reduced by a distributed implementation across the network. Finally, a novel distributed subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is proposed. Simulation results indicate that, although multiuser fairness is imperfect, capacity gains of up to 20% can be achieved compared with the traditional equal power allocation method. When multiuser fairness constraints are applied, a near-perfect fairness index is achieved; however, the peak capacity is reduced by approximately 10%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5730612/05699949.pdf","startPage":"919","endPage":"931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2107925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2107925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for OFDMA-Based Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","Cognitive radio","Iterative algorithm","Equations","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cognitive radio","frequency division multiple access","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed resource allocation","distributed subcarrier allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","relay networks","fixed relay stations","spectrum efficiency","user fairness","cognitive radio","iterative multilevel waterfilling","iterative barrier-constrained waterfilling","power reallocation algorithm","base-station-to-relay channels","fairness index","4G mobile communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication","frequency division multiaccess","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for OFDMA-Based Relay Networks","volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5699949/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11862680","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Allocation for OFDMA-Based Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-pan-2107925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078246S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5730612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5730612","articleId":"5699949","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5699957,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Snitchler","affiliation":["American Superconductor Corporation, Devens, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Snitchler","id":"37313441000"},{"name":"Bruce Gamble","affiliation":["American Superconductor Corporation, Devens, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Gamble","id":"37314238400"},{"name":"Christopher King","affiliation":["American Superconductor Corporation, Devens, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"King","id":"37066415700"},{"name":"Peter Winn","affiliation":["American Superconductor Corporation, Devens, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Winn","id":"37377579300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"5699957","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":186,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3114},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"10 MW Class Superconductor Wind Turbine Generators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","High temperature superconductors","Wind turbines","Rotors","Propulsion","Superconducting transmission lines","Wind energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-temperature superconductors","permanent magnet generators","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superconductor wind turbine generators","high temperature superconductor technology","direct-drive wind turbine systems","clean energy","permanent-magnet-based generators","gearboxes","high power wind turbine systems","NIST","Advanced Technology Program","key generator technologies","power 10 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High temperature superconductor (HTS)","superconductor","wind generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699957","abstract":"High temperature superconductor (HTS) technology enables generators with one third the weight and one half the losses of conventional machines.

Based on the proposed iterative co-simulation method, package temperature distribution and voltage drop with Joule heating and fluidic cooling effects can be estimated. Several packaging examples are simulated and the results show that with micro-channel fluidic cooling in high power density 3D integrated packages, the thermal effect on voltage drop is reduced by 10% which is much less than that of using a traditional heat sink.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/5739011/05699963.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2010.2101770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2010.2101770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739011","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical-Thermal Co-Simulation of 3D Integrated Systems With Micro-Fluidic Cooling and Joule Heating Effects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Heating","Equations","Cooling","Atmospheric modeling","Thermal conductivity","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convection","cooling","finite volume methods","integrated circuit packaging","iterative methods","microchannel flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical-thermal co-simulation","3D integrated systems","microchannel fluidic cooling","Joule heating","air convection","finite-volume method","voltage distribution equation","heat equations","iterative co-simulation","package temperature distribution","voltage drop","3D integrated packages","thermal effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite volume method","fluidic cooling","Joule heating","power delivery network (PDN)","thermal effect","through silicon via (TSV)","voltage drop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Electrical-Thermal Co-Simulation of 3D Integrated Systems With Micro-Fluidic Cooling and Joule Heating Effects","volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5699963/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11883885","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical-Thermal Co-Simulation of 3D Integrated Systems With Micro-Fluidic Cooling and Joule Heating Effects","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-xie-2101770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083571S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"5739011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5739011","articleId":"5699963","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5699964,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Debiec","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"bio":{"p":["Piotr D\u0119biec received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from the Technical University of Lodz (TUL), Lodz, Poland, in 1989 and 1999, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with TUL.

From the pedagogical point of view, two problems arise in these laboratories. First, students have some difficulties in understanding the link between discrete and programmable design techniques. Second, using only a single PLD, students are not automatically forced to learn modular design skills, which is one of the required learning outcomes in electrical engineering (EE) curricula. To overcome these problems, an innovative laboratory is proposed in this paper. Each training board contains four complex PLDs (CPLDs) and peripherals. In the initial sessions, students implement designs in which CPLDs are programmed as standard SSI/MSI chips and interconnected to construct the target circuit. Then, an active learning technique is used: Students form groups of any size and can set themselves more complex problems and choose their design approach. The proposed laboratory was set up at the Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland, and the first classes were given in the 2008-2009 academic year. The instructors' insights and design reports and feedback from students were gathered and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of the novel approach. Students were deeply involved in solving self-imposed problems. They learned \u201cengineering imagination,\u201d modular design, and teamwork skills. Some groups went far beyond the requirements set by the instructor. However, an additional conclusion is that the \u201cstandard\u201d approach should not be completely eliminated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/6062572/05699964.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","doi":"10.1109/TE.2011.2106131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2011.2106131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Teaching Discrete and Programmable Logic Design Techniques Using a Single Laboratory Board","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laboratories","Educational institutions","Hardware","Software","Hardware design languages","Sockets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering education","logic design","programmable logic devices","teaching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["teaching discrete","programmable logic design techniques","single laboratory board","single high-capacity PLD","breadboards","modular design skills","electrical engineering curricula","EE curricula","standard SSI-MSI chips","innovative laboratory","target circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Educational technology","electronics engineering education","laboratories","logic design","programmable logic devices (PLDs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5699964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2011","displayDocTitle":"Teaching Discrete and Programmable Logic Design Techniques Using a Single Laboratory Board","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5699964/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328269","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teaching Discrete and Programmable Logic Design Techniques Using a Single Laboratory Board","sourcePdf":"te-debiec-2106131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052423S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"6062572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6062572","articleId":"5699964","onlineDate":"24 January 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
