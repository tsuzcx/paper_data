A female complete T9 paraplegic had a stimulator for the anterior L2 to S2 spinal roots (bilaterally) implanted in 1994. She was provided with equipment for daily FES cycling exercise at home. The cycling controller applies a pattern of stimulation in each of 16 crank angle phases. A 7-bit shaft encoder measures the crank angle with adequate precision. Each pattern was originally chosen to give the greatest propulsive force in that position when there was no motion. However, dynamically, some reduction in co-contraction is needed; also the patterns are applied with a preset advance time. Maximal power is obtained with an advance of 250 ms, which compensates for muscle response delay and accommodates changes in cadence (from about 25 to 85 rpm). With this system, she has cycled 1.2 km at a time on gently undulating road. We found that spinal root stimulation gives sufficient control over the muscles in the legs to produce a fluid cycling gait. We propose that root stimulation for leg cycling exercise may be a practicable and valuable function for paraplegics following spinal cord injury.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2002.802860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/24582/01114835.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2002.802860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24582","startPage":"158","endPage":"164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of leg-powered paraplegic cycling using stimulation of the lumbo-sacral anterior spinal nerve roots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1114835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of leg-powered paraplegic cycling using stimulation of the lumbo-sacral anterior spinal nerve roots","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1114835/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486170","pubMedId":"12503780","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1114835/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of leg-powered paraplegic cycling using stimulation of the lumbo-sacral anterior spinal nerve roots","sourcePdf":"01114835.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113706S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"24582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"24582","articleId":"1114835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1114839,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In addition, the wavelet-based fractal analysis method was used to evaluate the gait of elderly subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The triaxial acceleration signals were measured close to the center of gravity of the body while the subject walked along a corridor and up and down stairs continuously. Signal measurements were recorded from 10 healthy young subjects and 11 elderly subjects. For comparison, two patients with Parkinson's disease participated in the level walking. The acceleration signal in each direction was decomposed to seven detailed signals at different wavelet scales by using the discrete wavelet transform. The variances of detailed signals at scales 7 to 1 were calculated. The fractal dimension of the acceleration signal was then estimated from the slope of the variance progression. The fractal dimensions were significantly different among the three types of walking for individual subjects (p < 0.01) and showed a high reproducibility. Our results suggest that the fractal dimensions are effective for classifying the walking types. Moreover, the fractal dimensions were significantly higher for the elderly subjects than for the young subjects (p < 0.01). For the patients with Parkinson's disease, the fractal dimensions tended to be higher than those of healthy subjects. These results suggest that the acceleration signals change into a more complex pattern with aging and with Parkinson's disease, and the fractal dimension can be used to evaluate the gait of elderly subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2002.802879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/24582/01114839.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2002.802879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24582","startPage":"188","endPage":"196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrimination of walking patterns using wavelet-based fractal analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1114839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrimination of walking patterns using wavelet-based fractal analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1114839/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486174","pubMedId":"12503784","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1114839/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrimination of walking patterns using wavelet-based fractal analysis","sourcePdf":"01114839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087305S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"24582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"24582","articleId":"1114839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1114855,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Tzung Chien","id":"37087199512"},{"name":"Chia-Chen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Chen Wu","id":"37087179308"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"1114855","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":349,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1232},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Feature extraction","Authentication","Neural networks","Linear discriminant analysis","Robustness","Prototypes","Face detection","Discrete wavelet transforms","Nearest neighbor searches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","feature extraction","wavelet transforms","statistical analysis","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminant waveletfaces","nearest feature classifiers","face recognition","feature extraction","classification rule","multiresolution wavelet transform","linear discriminant analysis","nearest feature plane","nearest feature space","nearest neighbor classifiers","nearest feature line classifiers","experiments"]}],"abstract":"Feature extraction, discriminant analysis, and classification rules are three crucial issues for face recognition.

The main difficulty of this method is choosing a window of appropriate size and shape. Small windows may lack sufficient intensity variation for reliable matching, while large windows smooth out disparity discontinuities. We propose an algorithm to choose a window size and shape by optimizing over a large class of \"compact\" windows. The word compact is used informally to reflect the fact that the ratio of perimeter to area of our windows is small. We believe that this is the first area based method which efficiently constructs nonrectangular windows. Fast optimization over compact windows is achieved via the minimum ratio cycle algorithm for graphs. The algorithm has only a few parameters which are easy to fix.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/24589/01114859.pdf","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1114859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1114859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1114859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo correspondence with compact windows via minimum ratio cycle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Pixel","Optimization methods","Search methods","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo image processing","image matching","graph theory","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo correspondence","compact windows","minimum ratio cycle","pixels","disparity discontinuities","window size","area based method","optimization","minimum ratio cycle algorithm","graphs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1114859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"Stereo correspondence with compact windows via minimum ratio cycle","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1114859/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486575","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo correspondence with compact windows via minimum ratio cycle","sourcePdf":"01114859.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049528S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"24589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"24589","articleId":"1114859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1114861,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In this regard, the finding method utilizing the CISPR (International Special Committee on Radio Interference) emission measurement system, which uses only electric field amplitude data, has been proposed. Until now, this method has been applied to a few point sources; however, the general applicability to continuously distributed sources has not been revealed. In this paper, we present a new approach for which a new index is defined. This is the ratio of the estimated current amplitude to norm (the deviation between the estimated electric field amplitude and the measured value). By mapping this index distribution, calculated from random initial values in the optimization, the sources distribution can be visualized. In order to experimentally verify this effectiveness, a metallic wire in a semi-anechoic chamber was used. As a result, the distributed sources were visualized and the maximum current position was estimated within 0.21 m at 150 MHz. This was also verified in computer simulations through the moment method. Consequently, it is revealed that the applicability of this method is greatly improved by the presented approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1114915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1114915/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7568690","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Visualization of radiated emission sources on a wire using far field amplitude data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualization of radiated emission sources on a wire using far field amplitude data","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1114915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050762S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8182","isNumber":"24591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8182","xplore-issue":"24591","articleId":"1114915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1114939,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The evaluation results reveal that SCIMA achieves 1.5 - 10 times higher performance compared with cache based architecture although the cycle time of SCIMA is 5.7% longer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1114939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7562370","htmlLink":"/document/1114939/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of high performance microprocessor with reconfigurable on-chip memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of high performance microprocessor with reconfigurable on-chip memory","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1114939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03395S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8182","isNumber":"24591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8182","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"24591","articleId":"1114939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1114942,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Since the training set plays a key role in the learning process, the paper is focused on the search for proper training sets.

The signal-to-noise ratio formula of this matched-filter is deduced at the end of the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia-Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/8182/24591/01115039.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"496 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Asia-Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2002.1115039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2002.1115039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1115039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking radar digital matched-filter ASIC design and its error analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar tracking","Application specific integrated circuits","Error analysis","Radar signal processing","Pulse compression methods","Hardware","Throughput","Arithmetic","Field programmable gate arrays","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar signal processing","radar tracking","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","logic CAD","logic simulation","matched filters","digital filters","application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","backscatter","error analysis","floating point arithmetic","pulse compression","tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar backscattering signal processing","tracking radar digital matched-filter ASIC design","filter error analysis","real time signal processing","processing throughput/precision","block-floating-point arithmetic","FPGA","ASIC work modes","pulse compression","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","102 mus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1115039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Tracking radar digital matched-filter ASIC design and its error analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1115039/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7574811","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking radar digital matched-filter ASIC design and its error analysis","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1115039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070286S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8182","isNumber":"24591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8182","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"24591","articleId":"1115039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1115053,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

In this article, we proposed a method for optimizing the structure of a fuzzy artificial neural network (FANN) through genetic algorithms. This genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the number of weight connections in a neural network structure, by evolutionary calculation of the fitness function of those structures as individuals in a population. The developed optimized fuzzy neural net is then applied for pattern recognition in an odor recognition system. Experimental results show that the optimized neural system provides higher recognition capability compared with that of unoptimized neural systems. The recognition rate of the unoptimized neural structure is 70.4% and could be increased to 85.2% in the optimized neural system. It is also shown that the computational cost of the optimized neural system structure is also lower than for the unoptimized structure.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2002.1115117","pdfPath":"/iel5/8182/24592/01115117.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"51 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia-Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"Asia-Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2002.1115117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of fuzzy-neural structure through genetic algorithms and its application in artificial odor recognition-system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1115117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of fuzzy-neural structure through genetic algorithms and its application in artificial odor recognition-system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7568702","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1115117/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of fuzzy-neural structure through genetic algorithms and its application in artificial odor recognition-system","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1115117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054813S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8182","isNumber":"24592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8182","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"24592","articleId":"1115117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1115120,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The availability of powerful processors and fast frame grabbers has made the use of vision-based trackers commonplace due to their accuracy as well as flexibility and ease of use. Current vision-based trackers are based on tracking of markers. The use of markers increases robustness and reduces computational requirements. However, their use can be very complicated, as they require maintenance. Direct use of scene features for tracking, therefore, is desirable. To this end, we describe a general system that tracks the position and orientation of a camera observing a scene without visual markers. Our method is based on a two-stage process. In the first stage, a set of features is learned with the help of an external tracking system during use. The second stage uses these learned features for camera tracking when the system in the first stage decides that it is possible to do so. The system is very general so that it can employ any available feature tracking and pose estimation system for learning and tracking. We experimentally demonstrate the viability of the method in real-life examples.","doi":"10.1109/ISMAR.2002.1115122","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The sensor has an on-chip calibration facility, the resulting fixed pattern noise is less than 0.02%. When operated in voltage mode it has a logarithmic response, but it can also be operated in current mode where it shows linear behavior. The proposed pixel cell has been implemented in a 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS technology.

The class indices generated by the fuzzy-ART network are further reduced with 2D run-length encoding. For the implementation of the fuzzy-ART network in VLSI, a force class fuzzy-ART network had been derived, where the maximum number of possible output classes is fixed. In this new network, input vectors will be forced into its closest class, when all classes are occupied. The results for force class fuzzy-Art network demonstrate that it is capable of large compression ratios and this network can easily be ported into hardware architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1115142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7568721","htmlLink":"/document/1115142/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-ART based image compression for hardware implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-ART based image compression for hardware implementation","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1115142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041238S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8182","isNumber":"24592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8182","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"24592","articleId":"1115142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1115144,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

As the DSM-PNN transfers information pulse-encoded by delta-sigma modulation, between every pair of neurons, they are connected with only 1-bit. Therefore the circuit scale becomes small and is effective for hardware implementation. In addition, the noise-shaping effect, which is a feature of delta-sigma modulation, enables the DSM-PNN to transmit the signal faithfully and operate multi-input summation and weight multiplication precisely. The proposed network was evaluated with the generalized Hebbian algorithm (GHA), which is the learning rule of principal component analysis (PCA), and implemented in FPGA. The experimental results show that the proposed system has the same accuracy as those with floating-point units.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2002.1115144","pdfPath":"/iel5/8182/24592/01115144.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"162 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia-Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"Asia-Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2002.1115144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware realization of novel pulsed neural networks based on delta-sigma modulation with GHA learning rule","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1115144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Hardware realization of novel pulsed neural networks based on delta-sigma modulation with GHA learning rule","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7568723","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1115144/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware realization of novel pulsed neural networks based on delta-sigma modulation with GHA learning rule","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1115144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05414S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8182","isNumber":"24592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8182","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"24592","articleId":"1115144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1115184,"authors":[{"name":"Zi-Wei Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, China"],"lastName":"Zi-Wei Zheng","id":"37280345100"},{"name":"Yi-Sheng Zhu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, China"],"lastName":"Yi-Sheng Zhu","id":"37280219700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7690-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1115184","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Signal processing","Fading","Parameter estimation","Frequency","Spread spectrum communication","Additive noise","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","channel estimation","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","mean square error methods","fading channels","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference cancellation","joint estimation/cancellation technique","multipath DS-CDMA systems","long spreading codes","linear prediction approach","channel response estimation","minimum-mean-square-error criterion","MMSE criterion","receiver","frequency-selective multipath fading"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, channel estimation and interference cancellation techniques are presented jointly for multipath DS-CDMA systems employing long spreading codes.

In comparison with the LBI, SCLA with the 9/7 filter has 7/12 the number of multiplications. This paper proposes a novel VLSI architecture to compute multilevel SCLA based 2-D DWT/IDWT with the 9/7 filter. The line based transform is integrated with the SCLA scheme to reduce the hardware cost and achieve higher hardware utilization. Efficient organization of six line-buffer memories is used to address the high memory bandwidth requirements.

The opamps are two-stage with folded-cascode as the first stage and feature techniques such as common-mode stabilized active load, cross-coupled cascode connection, and close-loop poles placement. MOS switches are driven by bootstrapping circuits that do not subject the devices to large, terminal voltages. The circuit layout is being completed and the chip will be fabricated in a 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS technology.

However, the designed Configurable Parallel Memory Architecture (CPMA) alleviates these multimedia data accessing requirements; achieving significant performance improvements over traditional memory architectures. CPMA decreases considerably the processor-memory bottleneck by widening the memory bandwidth, decreasing the number of memory accesses, and diminishing the significance of memory latency. To further enhance the performance of CPMA, this paper introduces a novel architectural extension called CPMA access instruction correlation recognition. The presented method is intended for accelerating the execution rate of consecutive, temporally conflict-free, CPMA memory accesses. As demonstrated in this paper, the superior CPMA performance can also be maintained in the case of limited access widths. In addition, the presented results confirm that CPMA can have an acceptable silicon area.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2002.1115348","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Euromicro Symposium on Digital System Design.

By combining guarded instructions and pseudo branches it is possible to achieve higher operation autonomy and higher instruction level parallelism than in previous SIMD/ASIMD architectures. The paper shows that it is feasible to avoid most branches and it is also possible to emulate conditional execution on the processing elements, either by using guarded instructions or by using pseudo branches, thus avoiding unnecessary intervention by the array control unit in data-dependant computations. Pseudo branches are used when it is not possible to use guarded instructions. Additionally, they also support the implementation of complex nested if-then-else constructs, improving the execution of irregular dataparallel applications. The paper also shows that the simplicity of the method allows it to be implemented both in fine-grain and coarse-grain SIMD/ASIMD architectures because it does not require significant additional silicon area. Finally, it is shown that pseudo branches can be used to control the power saving of those processing elements that have instructions nullified.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the operation autonomy of SIMD processing elements by using guarded instructions and pseudo branches","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Euromicro Symposium on Digital System Design.

Those problems are encountered particularly on long wires for global interconnect. As clock frequencies increase, scaled wires become relatively slower and on-chip communication will be the limiting performance factor of future chips. We explain why efficiently sharing of the wires for long distance communication is the solution to this problem. We introduce networks on silicon (NoS), that route packets over shared (semi)-global wires. NoS performance is expected to be high, but comes at a cost. Balancing the performance and cost of a NoS is a major challenge, and we believe busses still have a role to play.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Networks on silicon: blessing or nightmare?","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Euromicro Symposium on Digital System Design.

A DMF is designed in compliance with the W-CDMA specifications incorporating the proposed techniques, and its properties are evaluated by computer simulations at the gate level using 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS standard cell array technology.

Nevertheless, disregarding the multiplier entity allows for further circuit optimisations. Therefore look-up-table (LUT) based convolver (LC) versus the sum of the LUT-based Multipliers are described. Further, an alternative technique - (Parallel) distributed arithmetic convolver (DAC) is approached. The key issue of this paper is, however, a novel architectural solution: irregular distributed arithmetic convolver (IDAC) which, in comparison to the DAC, has an irregular form, and therefore allows for better circuit optimisation. All architectural solutions described hereby can be automatically generated by the automated tool for generation convolvers in FPGAs (AuToCon).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Convolvers","Arithmetic","Circuit optimization","Adders","Finite impulse response filter","Reconfigurable logic","Digital systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed arithmetic","table lookup","field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGAs","constant coefficient convolution","circuit optimisations","look-up-table","LUT-based multipliers","irregular distributed arithmetic convolver","architectural solutions","multiplier entity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1115381","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2002.1115381","startPage":"291","endPage":"298","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Euromicro Symposium on Digital System Design.

This problem is similar to image coding and transmission, except that the quantization, encoding and transmission are constrained to take place separately at each sensor (pixel location), in contrast to traditional image coding and transmission, wherein the entire image is available for quantization, encoding, and transmission. Due to the need to separately encode values from separate sensors, we pursue a Slepian-Wolf style coding approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Image coding","Wireless sensor networks","Image reconstruction","Quantization","Temperature sensors","Costs","Random processes","Decoding","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source coding","mean square error methods","sensor fusion","rate distortion theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Distributed Encoding","sensor data","mean squared error distortion","MSE","Slepian-Wolf style coding","separate sensors","continuous-time sources","source coding","rate-distortion function","sensor networks"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2002.1115429","startPage":"108","endPage":"110","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/8180/24584/01115429.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2002.1115429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed encoding of sensor data","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed encoding of sensor data","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7671016","publicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-25 Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1115429/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1115429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed encoding of sensor data","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1115429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049193S","chronDate":"20-25 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8180","isNumber":"24584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8180","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"24584","articleId":"1115429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1115430,"authors":[{"name":"V.A.

Our notion of duality in this paper is in a functional sense, where the optimal encoder mapping for a MIMO source coding problem becomes identical to the optimal decoder mapping for the dual MIMO channel coding problem, and vice versa. For ease of illustration we give the formulation only for two-input-two-output systems, which can be easily extended to the MIMO case. We present the precise mathematical conditions under which these encoder-decoder mappings are swappable in the two dual MIMO problems, identifying the key roles played by the source distortion and channel cost measures respectively in the MIMO source and channel coding problems in capturing this duality.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2002.1115431","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/8180/24584/01115431.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2002.1115431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On functional duality in MIMO source and channel coding problems having one-sided collaboration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1115431","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1115431/","displayDocTitle":"On functional duality in MIMO source and channel coding problems having one-sided collaboration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7671018","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1115431/","conferenceDate":"25-25 Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On functional duality in MIMO source and channel coding problems having one-sided collaboration","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1115431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061626S","chronDate":"20-25 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8180","isNumber":"24584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8180","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"24584","articleId":"1115431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1115432,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Cai","affiliation":["Fakultit fur Mathematik, Universitat Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"],"lastName":"Ning Cai","id":"37283369200"},{"name":"R.W.

The receiver knows that some symbols were omitted, but does not know either their values or their positions. This differs from the more widely studied erasure channel, where the positions of errors are known, and so all of the symbols that have been successfully received are known to be in their correct positions. In recent years, the interest in deletion channels has grown, possibly due to the fact that networks' packet loss can be modelled as deletions. Codes and bounds for this error model have been studied. One of the most fundamental works on deletions is that of Levenshtein (1965). This work contains bounds on the size of a maximal binary-alphabet codebook of length n words resilient to s deletions.

Superconducting materials eliminate any Joule heating but are based on very low operating temperatures. A high overall current density in the equipment may be presupposed. Cooling however must be guaranteed by cryogenic liquids, i.e. liquid helium or liquid nitrogen, respectively. The cooling liquids are interesting basic insulating fluids with a reasonable dielectric performance in the medium high voltage domain. Most exciting is the chemical inertness. Hazards such as fire risk in case of severe faults can be ruled out, thus reducing insurance cost drastically. Thermal aging of the liquids can also be disregarded because no chemical reaction must be taken into account during service, even in the case of temporary overload operation. Dielectric aging due to partial discharges may be of little concern because the liquids can be fully reprocessed easily by vaporizing and recondensing in a closed cooling circuit; no memory effects may degrade the liquid at all. On the other hand, overload operation may yield a large amount of thermal bubbles which can affect the dielectric strength seriously. Finally, the liquids are produced from gases which are found in the open atmosphere. There is no danger of any poisonous reaction in case of uncontrolled leakage, and the disposal of insulation systems at the end of operational life is straightforward without the need of costly processing.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2002.1115481","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/24598/01115481.pdf","startPage":"878","endPage":"890","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2002.1115481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Potential of cryogenic liquids for future power equipment insulation in the medium high voltage range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1115481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"Potential of cryogenic liquids for future power equipment insulation in the medium high voltage range","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7482315","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1115481/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potential of cryogenic liquids for future power equipment insulation in the medium high voltage range","sourcePdf":"01115481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0578S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"24598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"24598","articleId":"1115481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1115485,"authors":[{"name":"I.
