These signals are recorded with electrodes attached to the skin on top of selected muscles and reflect the activation of the observed muscle. They are evaluated by a sophisticated but simplified biomechanical model of the human body to derive the desired action of the operator. A support action is computed in accordance to the desired action and is executed by the exoskeleton. The biomechanical model fuses results from different biomechanical and biomedical research groups and performs a sensible simplification considering the intended application. Some of the model parameters reflect properties of the individual human operator and his or her current body state. A calibration algorithm for these parameters is presented that relies exclusively on sensors mounted on the exoskeleton. An exoskeleton for knee joint support was designed and constructed to verify the model and to investigate the interaction between operator and machine in experiments with force support during everyday movements. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.926860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4598893/04560058.pdf","startPage":"872","endPage":"882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.926860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Human--Exoskeleton Interface Utilizing Electromyography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560058/","displayDocTitle":"A Human--Exoskeleton Interface Utilizing Electromyography","volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4560058/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Human--Exoskeleton Interface Utilizing Electromyography","sourcePdf":"24tro04-fleischer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179563S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4598893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"265","xplore-issue":"4598893","articleId":"4560058","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4560067,"authors":[{"name":"Beatriz L\u00d3pez-Walle","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute/AS2M Department, UMR CNRS, Besancon, France"],"firstName":"Beatriz","lastName":"L\u00d3pez-Walle","id":"38274085900"},{"name":"Micha\u00cbl Gauthier","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute/AS2M Department, UMR CNRS, Besancon, France"],"firstName":"Micha\u00cbl","lastName":"Gauthier","id":"37301440300"},{"name":"Nicolas Chaillet","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute/AS2M Department, UMR CNRS, Besancon, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Chaillet","id":"37284995000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"4560067","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":481},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grippers","Microassembly","Ice","Assembly","Hydrodynamics","Thermoelectricity","Electrostatics","Ultrafast optics","Virtual prototyping","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grippers","ice","microassembling","micromanipulators","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["submerged freeze gripper","microassembly","microobjects manipulation","microobjects assembling","handling processes","thermal-based microgripper","surface forces","contact forces","hydrodynamic forces","ice grippers","ice generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ice gripper","micromanipulation","Peltier effect"]},{"kwd":["Ice gripper","micromanipulation","Peltier effect"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principle of a Submerged Freeze Gripper for Microassembly","abstract":"The development of reliable and repeatable strategies to manipulate and assemble microobjects lies in the efficiency, reliability, and precision of the handling processes. In this paper, we propose a thermal-based microgripper working in an aqueous medium. Manipulating and assembling in liquid surroundings can indeed be more efficient than in dry conditions. A comparative analysis of the impact of dry and liquid media on surface forces, contact forces, and hydrodynamic forces is shown. In addition, ice grippers represent flexible manipulation solutions. Nevertheless, when micromanipulation tasks are performed in air, capillary forces can drastically perturb the release. Our submerged freeze microgripper exploits the liquid surroundings to generate an ice droplet to catch microobjects, and to avoid capillary forces during the release. The thermal principle, the first microgripper prototype, an ice generation simulation, and the first tests are presented. The main objective is to validate the manipulation principle. Further research will be focused on control and optimization of the ice generation and the miniaturization of the system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.924944","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.924944","startPage":"897","endPage":"902","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4598893/04560067.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560067/","displayDocTitle":"Principle of a Submerged Freeze Gripper for Microassembly","volume":"24","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10144717","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4560067/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principle of a Submerged Freeze Gripper for Microassembly","sourcePdf":"24tro04-lopezwalle-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061617S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4598893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4598893","articleId":"4560067","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4560068,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Trivedi","affiliation":["Department ofMechanical and Nuclear Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4598893/4560068/4560068-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Deepak Trivedi received the B.Tech. degree in mechanical engineering in 2004 from the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, New Delhi, India, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 2007 from The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, where he is currently working toward the Doctoral degree in mechanical engineering.","His current research interests include mathematical modeling, structural dynamics, continuum mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and robotics."]},"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37969513800"},{"name":"Amir Lotfi","affiliation":["Department ofMechanical and Nuclear Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4598893/4560068/4560068-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Amir Lotfi received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

The service is designed to enable a robot to come to a user when its name is called correctly by the user. Therefore, techniques such as voice detection, robust speech recognition and detection of the location of the use are required. For efficient robot name registration by voice, the proposed method first restricts the search space for name registration by using monophone-based acoustic models. Then, the registration of robot names is completed using triphone-based acoustic models in the restricted search space. In order to provide a reliable service, the parameters for the robot name verification are calculated to reduce the acceptance rate of false calls. In addition, acoustic models are adapted by using a distance speech database to improve the performance of distance speech recognition. Moreover, the location of the user is estimated by using a microphone array. The experimental results for the registration and recognition of robot names show that the average word error rate (WER) of speech recognition is 1.7% in home environments, which is an acceptable WER for a real call- and-come service.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10090592","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4560082/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A name recognition based call-and-come service for home robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A name recognition based call-and-come service for home robots","sourcePdf":"p0247-oh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070966S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4560087,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Tao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4560070/4560087/4560087-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Tao Wang (S'03-M'06) received his B.Eng and Ph.D degrees in Electrical Engineering both from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

This will inevitably introduce an irreducible error floor, caused by the inter-transmit-antenna interference (ITAI), in the high signal-to-noise (SNR) region over the time selective fading channels. To mitigate the impact of ITAI, a novel signal detection scheme for four-transmit-antenna space-time-frequency coded OFDM system has been proposed in this paper. Through the theoretical analysis and computer simulations, it is proven that the proposed method can handle both slow and fast fading channels very effectively as well as efficiently, removing the error floor within the normal Doppler frequency range .","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4560070/04560087.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4560087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4560087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal detection for the STFC-OFDM system over time selective fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Fading","OFDM","Maximum likelihood decoding","Block codes","Computer errors","Intersymbol interference","Computer simulation","Maximum likelihood detection","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","fading channels","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","signal detection","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","STFC-OFDM system","time selective fading channels","space-time block coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","codeword length","inter-transmit-antenna interference","signal-to-noise region","four-transmit-antenna system","fast fading channels","normal Doppler frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Signal detection for the STFC-OFDM system over time selective fading channels","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4560087/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10090596","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal detection for the STFC-OFDM system over time selective fading channels","sourcePdf":"p0283-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09253S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4560088,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-Pao Cheng","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4560070/4560088/4560088-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shin-Pao Cheng was born in 1975 in Taiwan.

This CI-OFDM system spreads each information symbol across all N sub-carriers using orthogonal CI spreading codes. The CI-OFDM system can show the advantage of PAPR (peak to average power ratio) reduction and frequency diversity gains without any loss in the communication throughput. On the other hand, a great attention has been devoted to MIMO (multiple input multiple output) antenna array systems and space-time-frequency processing. In this paper, focusing on the two Tx (transmit) / one Rx (receive) antennas and two Tx / two Rx antennas configuration, we evaluate the performance of MIMO OFDM and MIMO CI- OFDM system. SFBC (space frequency block coding) coding is applied into both MIMO OFDM system and MIMO CI-OFDM system. For CI-OFDM realization, digital implemented CI-OFDM structure is used in which CI code spreading operation and carrier allocation are separately processed by simple IFFT type operation. From the simulation results, it is shown that MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM reduces PAPR significantly compared with MIMO SFBC-OFDM system. The out-of band re-growth of signal spectrum in MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM system is much smaller than MIMO SFBC OFDM. In the NBI (narrow band interference) channel MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM system achieves considerable BER improvement, compared with the MIMO SFBC-OFDM system in which error floor occurs in most of SNR range. So, it can be expected that MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM system is very useful for the high speed communication system in the situation of nonlinear HPA (high power amplifier) and NBI channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System design and analysis of MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM system against the nonlinear distortion and narrowband interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4560101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4560070/04560101.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4560101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560101/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"System design and analysis of MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM system against the nonlinear distortion and narrowband interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4560101/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10090609","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System design and analysis of MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM system against the nonlinear distortion and narrowband interference","sourcePdf":"p0368-ryu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09888S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560101","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4560106,"authors":[{"name":"Sungkeun Cha","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4560070/4560106/4560106-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sungkeun Cha received the B.S. degree in electrical & electronic engineering from University of Seoul, in 1995, and the M.S. degree from Yonsei University in 2006, Seoul, Korea.

The advanced peak windowing method is performed by introducing new weighting coefficients in case that successive peaks are generated within a half of the window length. Applying the new weighting coefficients, we can tightly limit the successive peaks to the given threshold level. Through a computer simulation, we verify that the BER performance improvement can be achieved by the proposed peak windowing method while maintaining almost the same complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) and spectral characteristics.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4560070/04560106.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4560106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4560106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new PAPR reduction technique for OFDM systems using advanced peak windowing method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Bit error rate","Computer simulation","Nonlinear distortion","Degradation","Power system modeling","Distribution functions","Fading","High power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","advanced peak windowing method","peak-to-average power ratio reduction technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","weighting coefficients","BER performance","complementary cumulative distribution function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new PAPR reduction technique for OFDM systems using advanced peak windowing method","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4560106/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10090614","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new PAPR reduction technique for OFDM systems using advanced peak windowing method","sourcePdf":"p0405-cha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061924S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4560107,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhong","affiliation":["Viaon Technology Company Limited, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4560070/4560107/4560107-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Zhong received his M.S. degree from Heilongjiang University of China in 2002 and Ph.

Since the LDPC codes are adopted in standards such as DVB-S2, IEEE 802.1 In and IEEE 802.16e and each standard allows various code rates and block lengths, an LDPC decoder architecture that could support multiple code rates and code block lengths is needed. The proposed architecture employs Benes network to implement configurable interconnection network. In the proposed architecture the number of levels and the delay of the interconnection network is reduced by using broadcasting technique which transmits reduced messages to save the complexity of the interconnection network. The number of processing units in the proposed partially parallel architecture is determined by investigating the relation between hardware complexity and throughput. By applying pipelining to the processing units, decoding throughput is increased. To verify the proposed architecture, a flexible LDPC decoder is implemented using a 0.18 mum CMOS process. The decoder occupies an area of 16.261 mm and runs correctly at the frequency of 212 MHz resulting in 1 Gbps decoding throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","volume":"54","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10090617","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4560109/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 1-Gb/s flexible LDPC decoder supporting multiple code rates and block lengths","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1-Gb/s flexible LDPC decoder supporting multiple code rates and block lengths","sourcePdf":"p0417-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070971S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4560110,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hyun Nam","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4560070/4560110/4560110-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Hyun Nam was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1983.

However, it has one main drawback of requiring an erase before updating the contents. Furthermore, flash memory can only be erased limited number of times. To overcome limitations, flash memory needs a software layer called flash translation layer (FTL). The basic function of FTL is to translate the logical address from the file system like file allocation table (FAT) to the physical address in flash memory. In this paper, a new FTL algorithm called an efficient and advanced space-management technique (EAST) is proposed. EAST improves the performance by optimizing the number of log blocks, by applying the state transition, and by using reallocation blocks. The results of experiments show that EAST outperforms FAST, which is an enhanced log block scheme, particularly when the usage of flash memory is not full.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4560140/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10090648","volume":"54","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An efficient and advanced space-management technique for flash memory using reallocation blocks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient and advanced space-management technique for flash memory using reallocation blocks","sourcePdf":"p0631-kwon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034505S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4560142,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Suk Son","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4560070/4560142/4560142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Suk Son was born in 1971.

From the older MPEG-2 to the latest H.264 and the Chinese AVS, many efficient coding tools have been introduced into MC, such as new motion vector prediction, bi-directional matching, quarter precision interpolation, etc. However, these new features enormously increase the computational complexity and the memory bandwidth consumption. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture design of motion compensation (MC) for multiple video standards including MPEG-2, H.264, and AVS. The proposed design has a macroblock- level pipelined structure which consists of MV predictor, cache-based Fetch, and pixel interpolation unit. The proposed architecture exploits the parallelism in MC algorithm to accelerate the processing speed and uses the dedicated design to optimize the memory access. MV predictor unit can cover all MV prediction algorithms for the three standards and provide a simple error concealment scheme. Cache-based Fetch unit can save 25% memory bandwidth of MC in average and doesn't impact the performance in the worst case. Pixel interpolation unit adopts fully separate 1D filtering structure which is designed to effectively avoid the redundant calculations. The architecture can achieve the real-time multiple-standard decoding for HDTV 1080i (1920*1088 4:2:0 60 field/s) video. The efficient design can work at the frequency of148.5MHz and the total gate count for logic circuit s is about 56K.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4560070/04560148.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4560148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4560148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel VLSI architecture of motion compensation for multiple standards","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Motion compensation","Interpolation","Bandwidth","Redundancy","Bidirectional control","Computational complexity","Computer architecture","Parallel processing","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","logic design","motion compensation","pipeline processing","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","motion compensation","video standard","MPEG-2","H.264","Chinese AVS","macroblock- level pipelined structure","MV predictor","cache-based Fetch","pixel interpolation unit","memory bandwidth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel VLSI architecture of motion compensation for multiple standards","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4560148/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10090656","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel VLSI architecture of motion compensation for multiple standards","sourcePdf":"p0687-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058459S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4560155,"authors":[{"name":"Hojin Ha","affiliation":["Digital Media Research & Development Center, Samsung Electronics Limited, Suwon, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4560070/4560155/4560155-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hojin Ha received the B.S. degree in Control and Instrumentation Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin, Korea, in 1998, and the M.S. degree in Control and Instrumentation Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea, in 2000.

As we know, such the serial run-length method is usually undesirable for hardware accelerator and thus, this paper proposes an efficient parallel algorithm to Run-Length Coding, which can determine the (Run, Level) combinations for one row of coefficients from a block in one clock cycle. In addition, Level-based multiple VLC tables switch mechanism (Context-based VLC) is further introduced in AVS-P2 entropy coding module to identify the big variation of probability distribution of (Run, Level) combinations. As a result, table selection for coding the current Level necessarily depends on the previously coded coefficients. Thus, we propose a parallel Looking-Up Table method, which can select the tables for one row of coefficients from a block in one clock cycle. On the other hand, at RDO stage, the calculation of rate term only needs to get the number of bits for each coded signal without the knowledge of its concrete value. Consequently, in hardware design, the Looking-Up Table in pre-coding can be mapped into a series of logic operations and thus much hardware memory can be saved. At the actual entropy coding, we only need to replace the logic operation of pre-coding with the actual 2D-VLC tables. Using our proposed hardware accelerator of AVS entropy coder, the results of simulation and synthesis demonstrate that the computing complexity and memory requirements are both reduced .","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware architecture for AVS entropy encoder","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4560159","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4560070/04560159.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4560159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"Hardware architecture for AVS entropy encoder","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4560159/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10090666","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware architecture for AVS entropy encoder","sourcePdf":"p0769-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102309S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4560169,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Lopez","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Microelectronics (IUMA), University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAIN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4560070/4560169/4560169-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sebasti\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, in 1978.

However, in spite of their relevance, the influence of the allocation of the computing resources in terms of the final area, power dissipation and processing speed of such architectures has not been studied in depth in the recent literature. In this sense, a new approach for exploring different allocation alternatives of the computational resources within H.264/AVC block matching motion estimation architectures is presented in this paper. In particular, a novel architectural template is introduced allowing the establishment, in a highly flexible way, of different groups of processing elements (PEs) within one-dimensional motion estimation arrays. The use of this methodology has enabled the evaluation of different design tradeoffs, motivating the introduction of a new architecture composed of four independents groups with four PEs each, able to process CIF@60fps sequences with a reduced equivalent gate count and dynamic power savings.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4560169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4560070/04560169.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4560169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560070","startPage":"845","endPage":"851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible template for H.264/AVC block matching motion estimation architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A flexible template for H.264/AVC block matching motion estimation architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10090676","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4560169/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible template for H.264/AVC block matching motion estimation architectures","sourcePdf":"p0845-Lopez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050198S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4560172,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Ling","affiliation":["Institute of Image Communication and Information Processing, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yang Ling received the B.S degree and M.S. degree in electronics engineering from the Department of Electronics Engineering, Zhejiang University in 2001, and 2004, respectively.

Comparing to conventional MCI method, there are four main advantages of the proposed algorithm. First, the motion vectors (MVs) embedded in the bit-stream are examined and corrected by the coding-type information, the spatial correlation in the MV field and the temporal correlation in the pixel field together. Second, constant motion velocity model based MV estimation for the blocks in the interpolated frame is used to gain the initial value with consideration of the correlation of the related MV. Third, further refinement on the estimated MVs is performed based on the spatial correlation in the interpolated frame and temporal correlation in the before and after frames together. Fourth, adaptive weighted bi-directional interpolation is applied to obtain final recovered pixels using the refined MVs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a significant increase on PSNR and also a great improvement of visual performance over the conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4560172","startPage":"863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4560070/04560172.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4560172","endPage":"869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel spatial and temporal correlation integrated based motion-compensated interpolation for frame rate up-conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel spatial and temporal correlation integrated based motion-compensated interpolation for frame rate up-conversion","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4560172/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10090679","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel spatial and temporal correlation integrated based motion-compensated interpolation for frame rate up-conversion","sourcePdf":"p0863-ling.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058851S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4560070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4560070","articleId":"4560172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4560208,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-wei Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Geomatics, National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4560192/4560208/4560208-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai-Wei Chiang received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in surveying engineering from National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in geomatics engineering from the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, in 2004.","He is an assistant professor with the Department of Geomatics, National Cheng-Kung University.

The clutter is modeled as a spherically invariant random process (SIRP) and its texture component is range dependent (heterogeneous clutter).

Thus, unknown parameters to be estimated are local texture values, the complex amplitudes and Doppler frequencies of all scattering centers. To do so, we use superresolution methods. The proposed detector assumes a priori knowledge on the spatial distribution of the target and has the precious property of having a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) with the assumption of a known speckle covariance matrix or by the use of frequency agility.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4560192/04560214.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2008.4560214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4560214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560192","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GLRT subspace detection for range and Doppler distributed targets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Covariance matrix","Frequency estimation","Testing","Random processes","Amplitude estimation","Parameter estimation","Scattering parameters","Spatial resolution","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal detection","covariance matrices","Doppler radar","radar clutter","radar detection","radar resolution","radar tracking","random processes","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized likelihood ratio test","GLRT subspace detection","adaptive range detection","Doppler distributed target","clutter model","spherically invariant random process","texture component","speckle component covariance matrix","parameter estimation","superresolution method","spatial target distribution","constant false alarm rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"GLRT subspace detection for range and Doppler distributed targets","volume":"44","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4560214/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10090766","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GLRT subspace detection for range and Doppler distributed targets","sourcePdf":"44aes02-Bon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17105S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4560192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4560192","articleId":"4560214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4560215,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Razavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4560192/4560215/4560215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Razavi received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in 1998 from Sharif University, Iran.

The effects of phase or frequency detector design, oscillator quality, coherent averaging time, and external Doppler aiding information on delaying loss of lock are quantified. It is shown that for PLLs the metric of total phase jitter is a reliable metric for assessing low C/N performance of the tracking loop provided the loop bandwidth is not too small (~> 5 Hz). For loop bandwidths that are not too small, total phase jitter accurately predicts carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N) at which loss of lock occurs. This predicted C/N is very close to the C/N predicted by bit error rate (BER). However, unlike BER, total phase jitter can be computed in real-time and an estimator for it is developed and experimentally validated. Total phase jitter is not a replacement for BER, since at low bandwidths it is less accurate than BER in that the receiver loses lock at a higher C/N than predicted by the estimator. Similarly, for FLLs operating at small loop bandwidths, it is found that normalized total frequency jitter is not a reliable metric for assessing loss of lock in weak signal or low C/N conditions. At small loop bandwidths, while total frequency jitter may indicate that a loop is still tracking, the Doppler estimates provided by the FLL will be biased.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10090767","htmlLink":"/document/4560215/","displayDocTitle":"Carrier loop architectures for tracking weak GPS signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier loop architectures for tracking weak GPS signals","sourcePdf":"44aes02-Razavi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075727S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4560192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4560192","articleId":"4560215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4560218,"authors":[{"name":"Soonho Jeong","affiliation":["Ministry of Nationa, Defense Acquisition Program Administration, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4560192/4560218/4560218-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soonho Jeong (M'05) was born in Seoul, Korea, on December 7, 1967.

A recently proposed class of quality metrics, known as structural similarity metrics (SSIM), models perception implicitly by taking into account the fact that the HVS is adapted for extracting structural information from images. We evaluate SSIM metrics and compare their performance to traditional approaches in the context of realistic distortions that arise from compression and error concealment in video compression/transmission applications. In order to better explore this space of distortions, we propose models for simulating typical distortions encountered in such applications. We compare specific SSIM implementations both in the image space and the wavelet domain; these include the complex wavelet SSIM (CWSSIM), a translation-insensitive SSIM implementation. We also propose a perceptually weighted multiscale variant of CWSSIM, which introduces a viewing distance dependence and provides a natural way to unify the structural similarity approach with the traditional JND-based perceptual approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural Similarity Quality Metrics in a Coding Context: Exploring the Space of Realistic Distortions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.926161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4563464/04560230.pdf","startPage":"1261","endPage":"1273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.926161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563464","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Structural Similarity Quality Metrics in a Coding Context: Exploring the Space of Realistic Distortions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4560230/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10090802","pubMedId":"18632337","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural Similarity Quality Metrics in a Coding Context: Exploring the Space of Realistic Distortions","sourcePdf":"17tip08-brooks.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062498S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4563464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4563464","articleId":"4560230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4560235,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Keong Goh","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4616503/4560235/4560235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Keong Goh received the B.Eng. and Ph.D degrees in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.","He joined the Data Storage Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), Singapore, in 2007, as a Research Fellow, where he became a Senior Research Fellow in 2008.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of evolutionary approaches in the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). While evolutionary techniques for neural networks have shown to provide superior performance over conventional training approaches, the simultaneous optimization of network performance and architecture will almost always result in a slow training process due to the added algorithmic complexity. In this paper, we present a geometrical measure based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) to estimate the necessary number of neurons to be used in training a single-hidden-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN). In addition, we develop a new hybrid multiobjective evolutionary approach that includes the features of a variable length representation that allow for easy adaptation of neural networks structures, an architectural recombination procedure based on the geometrical measure that adapts the number of necessary hidden neurons and facilitates the exchange of neuronal information between candidate designs, and a microhybrid genetic algorithm (muHGA) with an adaptive local search intensity scheme for local fine-tuning. In addition, the performances of well-known algorithms as well as the effectiveness and contributions of the proposed approach are analyzed and validated through a variety of data set types.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2000444","startPage":"1531","endPage":"1548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2000444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616503","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4616503/04560235.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Multiobjective Evolutionary Design for Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560235/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Multiobjective Evolutionary Design for Artificial Neural Networks","volume":"19","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4560235/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10185846","pubMedId":"18779086","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Multiobjective Evolutionary Design for Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"19tnn00-tan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15088S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4616503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4616503","articleId":"4560235","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4560238,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Chaves","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, INESC-ID, Lisboa, Portugal","Computer Engineering, EEMCS, University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4570466/4560238/4560238-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ricardo Chaves (S'05) received the graduate and Masters degree in electronics and computer science from the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Portugal, Spain, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

A number of numerical experiments are presented to illustrate that the standard continuous piecewise-linear neural network can be a promising tool for function approximation.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2000451","startPage":"1431","endPage":"1445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2000451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4588974","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4588974/04560241.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configuration of Continuous Piecewise-Linear Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4560241/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Configuration of Continuous Piecewise-Linear Neural Networks","volume":"19","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4560241/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10144101","pubMedId":"18701372","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configuration of Continuous Piecewise-Linear Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"19tnn00-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089016S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4588974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4588974","articleId":"4560241","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4560248,"authors":[{"name":"Keem Siah Yap","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Keem Siah","lastName":"Yap","id":"37287166900"},{"name":"Chee Peng Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Science Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chee Peng","lastName":"Lim","id":"37085388260"},{"name":"Izham Zainal Abidin","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Izham Zainal","lastName":"Abidin","id":"37398314000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4560248","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":714},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560248","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Resonance","Machine learning","Neurons","Pattern recognition","Kernel","Resource management","Subspace constraints","Bayesian methods","Multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ART neural nets","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","radial basis function networks","regression analysis","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insensitive loss function","generalized adaptive resonance theory","modified Gaussian adaptive resonance theory","generalized regression neural network","online learning","classification","time series prediction","online sequential extreme learning machine","sequential learning radial basis function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive resonance theory (ART)","Bayesian theorem","generalized regression neural network (GRNN)","online sequential extreme learning machine"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Online Systems","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2000992","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4616503/04560248.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"1641","endPage":"1646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2000992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid ART-GRNN Online Learning Neural Network With a --Insensitive Loss Function","abstract":"In this brief, a new neural network model called generalized adaptive resonance theory (GART) is introduced.

In this paper, we examine how anomaly metrics are affected by different environmental settings. To evaluate the effect of the traffic mix on the anomaly visibility, we use traces collected at the different border routers of a medium size national ISP. Since the traces consist of unsampled NetFlow traces, we further examine the impact of sampling on the selected metrics. For our analysis, we use our knowledge of the Blaster and Witty worms to establish a baseline of normal traffic against which we measure the size of the anomaly at various sampling rates. To evaluate the impact of the traffic mix, we compare the visibility of the anomaly for the four different routers and discuss the results. Among other results, we find that traffic mix characteristics sometimes compensate or even boost anomaly visibility in sampled views. We further show that, depending on the anomaly and the traffic mix, some anomaly metrics outperform unsampled data views even at sampling rates of up to 1 out of 10000 packets.","doi":"10.1109/ICIMP.2008.18","publicationTitle":"2008 The Third International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The Third International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection","pdfPath":"/iel5/4561310/4561311/04561323.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMP.2008.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4561311","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Traffic Mix and Packet Sampling on Anomaly Visibility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4561323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Traffic Mix and Packet Sampling on Anomaly Visibility","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2008-July 5 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4561323/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-5 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10091090","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4561323/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Traffic Mix and Packet Sampling on Anomaly Visibility","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"3189a031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072895S","chronDate":"June 29 2008-July 5 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4561310","isNumber":"4561311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4561310","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4561311","articleId":"4561323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4561324,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Kline","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Kline","id":"38096225000"},{"name":"Sangnam Nam","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Sangnam","lastName":"Nam","id":"38084471600"},{"name":"Paul Barford","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Barford","id":"37318285200"},{"name":"David Plonka","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Plonka","id":"38095544600"},{"name":"Amos Ron","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Amos","lastName":"Ron","id":"37318290100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3189-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4561324","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Detectors","Detection algorithms","Bit rate","Event detection","Internet","Monitoring","Protection","Measurement","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","wavelet transforms","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic anomaly detection","fine time scales","Bayes nets","high performance measurement systems","fine-grained timestamps","wavelet-based detectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"Traffic anomaly detection using high performance measurement systems offers the possibility of improving the speed of detection and enabling detection of important, short-lived anomalies. In this paper we investigate the problem of detecting anomalies using traffic measurements with fine-grained timestamps. We develop a new detection algorithm (called S3) that utilizes a Bayes Net to efficiently consider multiple input signals and to explicitly define what is considered \"anomalous''. The input signals considered by S3 are traffic volumes and correlations between ingress/egress packet and bit rates. These complementary signals enable identification of an expanded range of anomalies. Using a set of high precision traffic measurements collected at our campus border router over a 10 month period and an annotated anomaly log supplied by our network operators, we show that S3 is highly accurate, identifying 86% of the anomalies listed in the log. Compared with well known time series-based and wavelet-based detectors, this represents over a 20% improvement inaccuracy. Investigation of events identified by S3 that did not appear in the operator log indicate many are, in fact, true positives. Deployment of S3 in an operational environment supports this by showing zero false positives during initial tests.","doi":"10.1109/ICIMP.2008.33","publicationTitle":"2008 The Third International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The Third International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection","pdfPath":"/iel5/4561310/4561311/04561324.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMP.2008.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4561311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Anomaly Detection at Fine Time Scales with Bayes Nets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4561324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2008-July 5 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4561324/","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Anomaly Detection at Fine Time Scales with Bayes Nets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10091091","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4561324/","conferenceDate":"29 June-5 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Anomaly Detection at Fine Time Scales with Bayes Nets","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"3189a037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065754S","chronDate":"June 29 2008-July 5 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4561310","isNumber":"4561311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4561310","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4561311","articleId":"4561324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4561378,"authors":[{"name":"Gernot Hueber","affiliation":["Danube Integrated Circuit Engineering, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Gernot","lastName":"Hueber","id":"37294070100"},{"name":"Josef Zipper","affiliation":["Danube Integrated Circuit Engineering, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Zipper","id":"37698291700"},{"name":"Rainer Stuhlberger","affiliation":["Danube Integrated Circuit Engineering, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Stuhlberger","id":"37298722400"},{"name":"Andreas Holm","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Holm","id":"37358030300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1808-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1809-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-2517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0995"}],"articleNumber":"4561378","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":497},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Multiaccess communication","Demodulation","Baseband","Filters","GSM","Noise figure","Linearity","Energy consumption","Phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive multimode RF front-end","cellular terminals","multimode cellular applications","zero-IF receiver","LNA","analog baseband filter","CMOS","W-CDMA","GSM","EDGE","cdma2000","size 0.13 micron"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a fully-integrated performance-on-demand receiver front-end for GSM/EDGE/W-CDMA/CDMA2000 multi-mode cellular applications.

The single-chip zero-IF receiver comprises two self-matched LNAs for high/low-band, the demodulator and a fully-integrated DeltaSigma.fractional.N PLL. The integration of I/Q-ADCs and a digital front-end (DFE) enables an efficient 3rd-order analog baseband filter. Accurate channel and matched filtering, sample-rate conversion and dynamic-range control are achieved in the DFE allowing for greater flexibility. In the absence of any blocker the performance of demodulator, VCO, analog baseband filter and DFE are adapted to reduce the current consumption up to 42% versus the full-featured mode.

The poor performance of CMOS devices at millimeter-wave frequencies complicates the design. In this work, we present two low-area VCOs covering the license-free 60 GHz band, using differential shielded (slow-wave) transmission line inductors. We discuss design and provide compact modeling of these inductors, compatible with stringent metal density rules of scaled CMOS. Measured phase noise below -90 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset is achieved, at a consumption of 3.9 mW at 1 V. The tuning range exceeds 10 %, for a tuning voltage restricted from ground to the supply.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4550721/4561348/04561403.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"138","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2008.4561403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2008.4561403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4561348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4561403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VCO design for 60 GHz applications using differential shielded inductors in 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","Inductors","Millimeter wave circuits","Millimeter wave measurements","Frequency","Distributed parameter circuits","Semiconductor device modeling","Transmission line measurements","Noise measurement","Phase measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","electromagnetic shielding","field effect MIMIC","inductors","millimetre wave oscillators","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VCO design","differential shielded inductor","CMOS circuit","transmission line inductor","frequency 60 GHz","size 0.13 micron","power 3.9 mW","voltage 1 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","60 GHz","slow-wave","transmission line","scaling","VCO","RF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4561403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"VCO design for 60 GHz applications using differential shielded inductors in 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4561403/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10103340","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VCO design for 60 GHz applications using differential shielded inductors in 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07052008-00055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051995S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4550721","isNumber":"4561348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4550721","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4561348","articleId":"4561403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4561404,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The FNFS employs a staked structure of MIM and MOS capacitors for LPF to economize the area. Fast AFC time is realized by using the prescaler output signal as a discriminating clock. A 3-bit 3rd order Sigma-Delta modulator serves as a fractional engine. Phase switching type prescaler is used to reduce the quantization noise of Sigma-Delta modulator. A fast switching CP is introduced. LC VCO utilizes bond-wire inductors with high Q-factor and a small area. Digitally controlled crystal oscillator (DCXO) provides a reference signal of high spectral purity. A prototype has been implemented in 0.13 mum CMOS technology. The measurements results show that the AFC time is less than 20-mus, in-band phase noise is -94 dBc/Hz, and out-band phase noise are -123 dBc/Hz at 400 KHz offset frequency and - 145 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz offset frequency when the carrier frequency is 900 MHz.

The noise power in the receive band (Rx noise) is -136 dBm/Hz at output power of 26 dBm at a frequency of 2.14 GHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An envelope tracking power amplifier using an adaptive biased envelope amplifier for WCDMA handsets","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2008.4561464","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4550721/4561348/04561464.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2008.4561464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4561348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4561464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4561464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"An envelope tracking power amplifier using an adaptive biased envelope amplifier for WCDMA handsets","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4561464/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10103400","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An envelope tracking power amplifier using an adaptive biased envelope amplifier for WCDMA handsets","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07052008-00116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043886S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4550721","isNumber":"4561348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4550721","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4561348","articleId":"4561464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4561465,"authors":[{"name":"Gary Hau","affiliation":["ANADIGICS, Inc., Tyngsboro, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Hau","id":"37369684200"},{"name":"Shih Hsu","affiliation":["ANADIGICS, Inc., Tyngsboro, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Shih Hsu","id":"37588293200"},{"name":"Yutaka Aoki","affiliation":["CASIO COMPUTER Corporate Limited, Ome, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yutaka Aoki","id":"37555028500"},{"name":"Takeshi Wakabayashi","affiliation":["CASIO COMPUTER Corporate Limited, Ome, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Takeshi Wakabayashi","id":"38084503300"},{"name":"Naoki Furuhata","affiliation":["IBIDEN Company Limited, Gifu, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoki Furuhata","id":"37328320600"},{"name":"Yukinobu Mikado","affiliation":["IBIDEN Company Limited, Gifu, Japan"],"lastName":"Yukinobu Mikado","id":"37991269500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1808-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1809-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-2517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0995"}],"articleNumber":"4561465","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":577},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Energy management","Integrated circuit packaging","Power generation","Multiaccess communication","High power amplifiers","Gallium arsenide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Voltage control","Buck converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar MMIC","broadband networks","code division multiple access","DC-DC power convertors","gallium arsenide","heterojunction bipolar transistors","III-V semiconductors","MMIC power amplifiers","power semiconductor devices","silicon","wafer level packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded-wafer-level packaged WCDMA","HBT power amplifier module","integrated DC power management IC","closed-loop controlled DC-DC buck converter","redistribution layer","current 65 mA to 370 mA","Si","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC converter efficiency enhancement","embedded wafer level package (EWLP)","heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT)","linear amplifiers","power amplifiers","wafer level package (WLP)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a highly compact 3 times 3 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n WCDMA power amplifier (PA) module which integrates a GaAs HBT MMIC PA and a Si DC power management IC into one single package. A closed-loop controlled DC-DC buck converter allows the power management IC to adaptively optimize the PA collector voltage as a function of output power and thereby reduce current consumption under backoff operation. A novel embedded-wafer-level-package (EWLP) technology is developed for module miniaturization. Redistribution layers and bumps are formed on the Si IC to create the wafer level package (WLP). The EWLP is then fabricated by embedding the WLP IC inside the core of the module. The MMIC PA is mounted on the surface of the module, creating a vertical integration for size reduction. The PA module (PAM) achieves excellent current reduction over a wide range of output power (Pout) up to 27.5 dBm, while maintaining ACLR1 below -40 dBc. At 16 dBm and 24 dBm Pout, the current consumptions are reduced from 162 mA and 370 mA, to 65 mA and 237 mA, respectively, compared to the conventional PA.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2008.4561465","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4550721/4561348/04561465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2008.4561465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4561348","startPage":"409","endPage":"412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3x3mm<sup>2</sup> embedded-wafer-level packaged WCDMA GaAs HBT power amplifier module with integrated Si DC power management IC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4561465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 3x3mm<sup>2</sup> embedded-wafer-level packaged WCDMA GaAs HBT power amplifier module with integrated Si DC power management IC","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4561465/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10103401","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4561465/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3x3mm<sup>2</sup> embedded-wafer-level packaged WCDMA GaAs HBT power amplifier module with integrated Si DC power management IC","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07052008-00117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046299S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4550721","isNumber":"4561348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4550721","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4561348","articleId":"4561465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4561466,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tombak","affiliation":["Corporate Research & Development, RFMD, Inc., Greensboro, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Tombak","id":"37268773600"},{"name":"Robert J.

On-chip design for testability (DfT) features, which are meant to reduce test time and cost also suffer from parameter variability. Therefore, RF calibration of all on-chip test structures is mandatory. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed as multivariate regression technique to architect a general RF calibration scheme using DC- instead of RF stimuli. This relaxes the routing requirements on a chip for GHz test signals along with the reduction in test time and cost. The RF detector, a key element of a radio front-end DfT circuitry, designed in 65 nm CMOS is used to demonstrate the calibration scheme.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2008.4561502","pdfPath":"/iel5/4550721/4561348/04561502.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"574","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2008.4561502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4561348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-chip calibration of RF detectors by DC stimuli and artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4561502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"On-chip calibration of RF detectors by DC stimuli and artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10103437","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4561502/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-chip calibration of RF detectors by DC stimuli and artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07052008-00154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073076S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4550721","isNumber":"4561348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4550721","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4561348","articleId":"4561502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4561505,"authors":[{"name":"Koji Tsutsumi","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Tsutsumi","id":"37298133000"},{"name":"Fumiki Onoma","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiki","lastName":"Onoma","id":"37831597400"},{"name":"Jun Koide","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Koide","id":"37294531500"},{"name":"Mikio Uesugi","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Mikio","lastName":"Uesugi","id":"37294533300"},{"name":"Noriharu Suematsu","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriharu","lastName":"Suematsu","id":"37298359500"},{"name":"Hiroshi Harada","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan","National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Harada","id":"37276707400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1808-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1809-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-2517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0995"}],"articleNumber":"4561505","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Cognitive radio","Signal generators","Frequency conversion","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Switching circuits","Signal analysis","Degradation","Band pass filters","MMICs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","cognitive radio","frequency dividers","Ge-Si alloys","MMIC oscillators","switching circuits","transceivers","UHF integrated circuits","UHF oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMIC direct conversion transceiver","LO switching configuration","cognitive radio","LO signals","switching circuits","BiCMOS process","frequency 400 MHz to 6 GHz","size 0.18 mum","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Direct conversion","FDD","MMICs","multi-band","multi-mode","TDD","Tx spurious"]}],"abstract":"A low spurious SiGe-MMIC direct conversion transceiver using 2f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LO</sub>\n LO switching configuration for cognitive radio is described.

Current mining methods might individually find each motif block but fail to connect them with large irregular gaps. In this paper we propose a novel method for the efficient extraction of structured motifs from DNA sequences using multi-objective genetic algorithm. The main advantage of our approach is that a large number of nondominated motifs can be obtained by a single run with respect to conflicting objectives: similarity and support maximization and gap minimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in this direction. The proposed method can be applied to any data set with a sequential character. Furthermore, it allows any choice of similarity measures for finding motifs. By analyzing the obtained optimal motifs, the decision maker can understand the tradeoff between the objectives. We compare our method with the two well-known structured motif extraction methods, EXMOTIF and RISOTTO. Experimental results on synthetics data set demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits good performance over the other methods in terms of runtime.","doi":"10.1109/CBMS.2008.99","startPage":"278","endPage":"283","publicationTitle":"2008 21st IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical

The system consists of two small profile CMOS cameras, and a power efficient, dual-core embedded media processor, running at 600 MHz per core. The stereo-matching engine performs sub-sampling, rectification, pre-processing using rank transform, correlation-based matching using three levels of recursion, L/R consistency check and post-processing. We have proposed a novel and efficient post-processing algorithm that removes outliers due to low-texture regions and depth discontinuities by combining the contributions from the variance map of the rectified image, disparity map, and the variance map of the disparity map. To further enhance the performance of the system, we have implemented a two staged pipelined-processing scheme that takes advantage of the dual-core architecture of the embedded processor, thereby achieving a processing speed of around 10 fps for disparity maps.","doi":"10.1109/CRV.2008.37","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4562080/4562081/04562091.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRV.2008.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Miniaturized Embedded Stereo-Vision System (MESVS-I)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562091/","displayDocTitle":"A New Miniaturized Embedded Stereo-Vision System (MESVS-I)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10117383","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562091/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Miniaturized Embedded Stereo-Vision System (MESVS-I)","confLoc":"Windsor, Canada","sourcePdf":"3153a026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073112S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4562080","isNumber":"4562081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4562080","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4562081","articleId":"4562091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4562120,"authors":[{"name":"Moulay Akhloufi","affiliation":["Computer vision Laboratory, Laval University, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Moulay","lastName":"Akhloufi","id":"37593949200"},{"name":"Abdelhakim Bendada","affiliation":["Computer vision Laboratory, Laval University, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdelhakim","lastName":"Bendada","id":"37605443500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3153-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4562120","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Face detection","Blood vessels","Biomedical imaging","Infrared imaging","Data mining","Temperature","Skin","Computer vision","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal faceprint","thermal face signature extraction","infrared face recognition","physiological feature extraction","blood vessels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","Biometrics","Infrared imaging","Segmentation"]}],"abstract":"In this work we present an efficient approach for physiological features extraction from infrared face images.

The problem has a mixed-integer nonlinear structure, which makes very hard to handle the corresponding mathematical models. However, modern mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) software tools have reached a high efficiency, both in terms of solution accuracy and computing time. Hence we introduce MILP models of increasing complexity, which allow to accurately represent most of the hydroelectric system characteristics, and turn out to be computationally solvable. In particular we present a model that takes into account the head effects on power production through an enhanced linearization technique, and turns out to be more general and efficient than those available in the literature. The practical behavior of the models is analyzed through computational experiments on real-world data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562139/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10117908","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An MILP Approach for Short-Term Hydro Scheduling and Unit Commitment With Head-Dependent Reservoir","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MILP Approach for Short-Term Hydro Scheduling and Unit Commitment With Head-Dependent Reservoir","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs03-borghetti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093978S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4578730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"4578730","articleId":"4562139","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4562140,"authors":[{"name":"Bei Gou","affiliation":["Energy System Research Center, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Bei","lastName":"Gou","id":"37281766100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"4562140","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":341,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3584},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integer linear programming","Phasor measurement units","Observability","Current measurement","Power system modeling","Power system simulation","Voltage measurement","Robustness","State estimation","Power system measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","phase measurement","power system measurement","power system state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer linear programming","optimal PMU placement","phasor measurement unit","power system state estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integer linear programming","observability analysis","phasor measurement units"]}],"abstract":"Based on the integer linear programming formulation proposed for optimal PMU placement, this paper presents a generalized integer linear programming formulation for cases including redundant PMU placement, full observability and incomplete observability.

Vehicle motion analysis plays an essential role in various intelligent vehicle applications, such as cruise control, vehicle platooning, and collision avoidance. In this paper, it's proposed to improve the accuracy of vehicle motion analysis by breaking the task into two complementary steps: incoming vehicle detection and vehicle motion analysis. In the vehicle detection, a new vehicle which enters the observation field will be identified by inspecting its vehicle-related features. Once a vehicle is detected, a fine-level motion analysis mechanism is employed to monitor its position and relative speed based on the temporal consistency exploitation. Specifically, a novel 3-D Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) model is employed for optical flow calculation and optimization. The improved optical flow is then interpreted to generate reliable vehicle motion estimation. Overall, the proposed method shows excellent performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency owing to its effective coarse-to-fine processing scheme and multiple-cue consideration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562188/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13342401","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle motion analysis based on a monocular vision system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle motion analysis based on a monocular vision system","confLoc":"Manchester","sourcePdf":"SPI-07052008-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044893S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2008","isNumber":"4562143","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4550748","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4562188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562255,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhua Yu","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/4560188/4562255/4562255-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenhua Yu joined Department of Electrical Engineering of the Pennsylvania State University, and has been a group leader of Electromagnetic Communication Lab since 1996.

The IBM BlueGene/L supercomputer are examples. They have recently made it possible to solve extremely large problems efficiently. For instance, they have reduced 52 days of simulation on a single Pentium 4 processor to only about 10 minutes on 4000 processors in a BlueGene/L supercomputer. In this article, we investigate the performance of a parallel Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) code on a large BlueGene/L system. We show that the efficiency of the code is excellent, and can reach up to 90%. The code has been used to simulate a number of electrically large problems, including a 100 * 100 patch antenna array, a 144-element dual- polarized Vivaldi array, a 40-element helical antenna array, and an electronic packaging problem. The results presented serve to demonstrate the efficiency of the parallelization of the code on the BlueGene/L system.

The targeted application range is to enable C-FDTD simulations for real-word engineering problems. Based on computer-graphics methods, complex CAD models with thousands of distinct parts can be efficiently and robustly discretized. A versatile concept is introduced to avoid numerical inaccuracies while calculating intersections, and to lead to a symmetric discretization without the overhead of \"virtual lines.\" In addition, a necessary three-dimensional consistency check/correction, as well as merging of conformal cells of different CAD parts, are explained. The conformal geometric information is incorporated into the conventional FDTD algorithm using the conventional updating coefficients, which are conformally enhanced. Due to the derived stability criterion, the conformal updating scheme is always stable. The robustness and performance of the discretization algorithm presented is demonstrated with CAD models of increasing complexity towards real-world benchmarks. A conformal FDTD simulation with 80 million computational cells and 229 distinguished parts, representing a complete mobile phone and a head with hand, demonstrates the capabilities of the versatile technique.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2008.4562256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/4560188/04562256.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2008.4562256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560188","startPage":"45","endPage":"57","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mastering Conformal Meshing for Complex CAD-Based C-FDTD Simulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mastering Conformal Meshing for Complex CAD-Based C-FDTD Simulations","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562256/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10117831","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562256/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mastering Conformal Meshing for Complex CAD-Based C-FDTD Simulations","sourcePdf":"502008-Stefan-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092894S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4560188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4560188","articleId":"4562256","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4562259,"authors":[{"name":"Gonca Cakir","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/4560188/4562259/4562259-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gonca Cakir was born in 1975.

Most transformers are equipped with protection systems to avoid damage to the transformers [1]. As any outage of the transformer have severed technical and economical consequences for the network, so implementing fast relaying algorithms for transformer protection devices to satisfy high reliability of the whole power systems is very important. In designing high speed protection systems, the fast discrimination of magnetizing inrush current is very important to prevent the false tripping of relays. The conventional method of inrush current detection [2] for transformer protection based on the value of the second harmonic component of the differential current which requires a long time exceeding one cycle. This paper discriminates between the inrush current state and the internal fault condition based on the transformer magnetizing characteristics within one short cycle. Simulation using EMTP-ATP program on a three phase transformer are carried out. Study cases of inrush current at different switching instants and for all types of internal faults for different phases and on different percentages of transformer windings are simulated. The results obtained from EMTP-ATP package for all simulated conditions used as a training data to artificial neural network (ANN). This helps the differential relay to recognize inrush and internal fault and give the trip signal in case of internal fault only.","doi":"10.1109/MEPCON.2008.4562345","pdfPath":"/iel5/4545824/4562294/04562345.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"516","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 12th International Middle-East Power System Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 12th International Middle-East Power System Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEPCON.2008.4562345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast and reliable transformer protection system based on the transformer magnetizing characteristics and artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A fast and reliable transformer protection system based on the transformer magnetizing characteristics and artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10060602","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562345/","conferenceDate":"12-15 March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast and reliable transformer protection system based on the transformer magnetizing characteristics and artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Aswan, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-06252008-00051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059536S","chronDate":"12-15 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4545824","isNumber":"4562294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4545824","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4562294","articleId":"4562345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4562353,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The key feature of the security monitoring is the critical fault clearing time. Time-domain simulation is used to determine the unstable point of the power system based on bisection technique to reduce computation time. The Independent System Operator (ISO) should plan hours-ahead or days-ahead rescheduling to determine the optimal allocation of generated power from each generator based on the expected system disturbances. The objective is to find proper adjustments of the generated power that maintain acceptable security levels throughout the system and minimize system losses. The generation rescheduling (GR) is considered as a necessary remedial action to improve the system transient stability during the disturbances. PSO is used to determine the most suitable generation coordination among system generators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562360/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10067301","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562360/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generation coordination for transient stability enhancement using particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation coordination for transient stability enhancement using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Aswan, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-06252008-00066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076006S","chronDate":"12-15 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4545824","isNumber":"4562294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4545824","xplore-issue":"4562294","articleId":"4562360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4562378,"authors":[{"name":"Almoataz Y.

Similar to other sensorless methods based on signal injection, the resulting control signals of the indirect flux detection method by on-line reactance measurement is influenced, for example, by the saturation based saliency, the slotting saliency, and the anisotropy saliency as well as by load and flux level. Since these influences are extremely dependant on the machine design, they can hardly be calculated in advance and removed by filtering or digital signal processing. However the possibility of utilizing a neural network for learning the individual dependencies and removing the unwanted influences can provide a very satisfactory result. Since the easy implementation of a neural network does only use a small amount of calculation power, the algorithm can be implemented even in low-cost signal processors. Measurements on mechanical sensorless controlled induction machines present adequate results up to about rated load.","doi":"10.1109/MEPCON.2008.4562401","startPage":"377","endPage":"381","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 12th International Middle-East Power System Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4545824/4562294/04562401.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 12th International Middle-East Power System Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEPCON.2008.4562401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency tracking-based sensorless control of induction machines using artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensorless control","Induction machines","Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Induction motor drives","Mechanical sensors","Induction motors","Shafts","Frequency","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine control","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saliency tracking-based sensorless control","induction machines","artificial neural networks","induction motor drives","signal injection","indirect flux detection method","on-line reactance measurement","mechanical sensorless control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensorless control","induction machines","signal injection","ANN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Saliency tracking-based sensorless control of induction machines using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 March 2008","accessionNumber":"10060626","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency tracking-based sensorless control of induction machines using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Aswan, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-06252008-00107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053547S","chronDate":"12-15 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4545824","isNumber":"4562294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4545824","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4562294","articleId":"4562401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4562402,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

This transient current change is influenced by the transient phase reactances and these in turn are modulated with the flux-and rotor position, which is the desired information for sensorless control. In this paper a special algorithm is proposed using DFT (discrete fourier transform) method for tracking the saturation and slotting components from the measured saliency signal.

In-country and near-off-shore wind turbines are becoming more common on the European continent. The United States has recently set long-term goals to generate 10% of national electric power using renewable sources. In order to make such turbines efficient, current 1.5 MW wind-turbine towers and rotors are very large, with blades exceeding 67 m in diameter, and tower heights exceeding 55 m. Newer 4.5 MW designs are expected to be even larger. The problem with such large, moving, metallic devices is the potential interference such structures present to an array of civilian air-traffic-control radars. A recent study by the Undersecretary of Defense for Space and Sensor Technology acknowledged the potential performance impact wind turbines introduce when located within line of site of air-traffic-control or air-route radars [Report to the Congressional Defense Committees on The Effect of Windmill Farms On Military Readiness, 2006]. In the spring of 2006, the Air Force Research Laboratory embarked on a rigorous measurement and prediction program to provide credible data to national decision makers on the magnitude of the signatures, so that the interference issues could be credibly studied. This paper, the first of two parts, will discuss the calibrated RCS measurement of the turbines, and compare this data (with its uncertainty) to modeled data.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2008.4562424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/4560188/04562424.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2008.4562424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4560188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Radar Cross Section and Radar Doppler Measurements of Commercial General Electric Windmill Power Turbines Part 1: Predicted and Measured Radar Signatures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562424/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Radar Cross Section and Radar Doppler Measurements of Commercial General Electric Windmill Power Turbines Part 1: Predicted and Measured Radar Signatures","volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10117838","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562424/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Radar Cross Section and Radar Doppler Measurements of Commercial General Electric Windmill Power Turbines Part 1: Predicted and Measured Radar Signatures","sourcePdf":"502008--64.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066397S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4560188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4560188","articleId":"4562424","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4562448,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Specifically, we assume that the noise of the radio spectrum band can still be adequately modeled using Gaussian distribution. We then compute and analyze Akaike weights in order to decide if the distribution of the received signal fits the noise distribution or not.

In the cognitive radio system, many important issues exist. Spectrum sensing is one of the important issues, which has been studied throughout recently. In this paper, we propose a new distributed spectrum sensing scheme which considers the difference of sensing capabilities among cognitive terminals. By using our proposed scheme, we can effectively measure the sensing capability of a cognitive terminal and optimize the performance of the spectrum sensing by differentiating the number of spectrum sensing that each cognitive terminal performs. Through performance analysis and numerical results, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve desired performance in view of the probability of false alarm and the probability of miss detection compared to a conventional scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562450.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing Optimization Considering Sensing Capability of Cognitive Terminal in Cognitive Radio System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562450/","displayDocTitle":"Sensing Optimization Considering Sensing Capability of Cognitive Terminal in Cognitive Radio System","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103246","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing Optimization Considering Sensing Capability of Cognitive Terminal in Cognitive Radio System","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06478S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4562451,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37676440200"},{"name":"Zhengguang Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhengguang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37288588700"},{"name":"Furong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Furong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37403436900"},{"name":"Benxiong Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Benxiong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37287170300"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37675698600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562451","dbTime":"47 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":103,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1922},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Detectors","Matched filters","Gaussian noise","AWGN channels","Signal detection","Chromium","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double threshold energy detection","cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["double threshold","energy detect","cooperative sensing","cognitive radio"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double Threshold Energy Detection of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562451","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562451","abstract":"Cognitive radio has become an effective theory to solve the inefficiency of the spectrum usage, and cooperative spectrum sensing among the secondary users to detect the primary user accurately is broadly studied before.

Since there is a tradeoff between the probability of missed detection and the probability of false alarm according to a value of sensing threshold, it is very important to determine the sensing threshold suitable for cognitive radio environments. In this paper, we propose a novel method to determine the sensing threshold in the cognitive radio system, in which the secondary user (SU) first decides its transmission power for the communication and then decides the sensing threshold for the coexistence with the primary user (PU). For the coexistence, the SU controls its sensing threshold adaptively according to its transmission power in order to guarantee the minimum decodable SINR for the primary receiver. The analysis results show that the adaptively controlled sensing threshold decreases both the missed detection and the false alarm simultaneously and so enables both SU and PU to coexist in the same channel without interfering each other.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10103248","htmlLink":"/document/4562452/","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sensing Threshold Control Based on Transmission Power in Cognitive Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sensing Threshold Control Based on Transmission Power in Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05668S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562455,"authors":[{"name":"Maziar Nekovee","affiliation":["Centre for Computational Science, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Maziar","lastName":"Nekovee","id":"37303754000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562455","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562455","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Radio spectrum management","Chromium","TV","Personal digital assistants","Competitive intelligence","FCC","Technology management","Wireless communication","Licenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum management","opportunistic spectrum access model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562455","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562455.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Cognitive Radio on Future Management of Spectrum","abstract":"Cognitive radio is a breakthrough technology which is expected to have a profound impact on the way radio spectrum will be accessed, managed and shared in the future.

The objectives are to find how the scarce radio spectrum allocated to different services is utilized in Singapore and identify the bands that could be accessed for future opportunistic use due to their low or no active utilization. The results from the spectrum measurements taken over 12 weekday periods reveal that a significant amount of spectrum in Singapore has very low occupancy all the time. The occupancy is quantified as the amount of spectrum detected above a certain received power threshold. The outcome of this study suggests that Singapore has a great potential for employing emerging spectrum sharing technology such as the cognitive radio technology to accommodate enormous demands for future wireless services. However, this study of spectrum survey is preliminary in its nature and future long term studies need to be performed to determine any potential secondary usage on those channels that have low or no active utilization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562457.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Survey in Singapore: Occupancy Measurements and Analyses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Radio frequency","Radio spectrum management","Force measurement","White spaces","Frequency measurement","Pattern analysis","Radiofrequency identification","Time measurement","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["occupancy measurements","active utilization","spectrum measurements","power threshold","spectrum sharing technology","cognitive radio technology","wireless services","potential secondary usage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Survey in Singapore: Occupancy Measurements and Analyses","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562457/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103252","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Survey in Singapore: Occupancy Measurements and Analyses","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084081S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4562458,"authors":[{"name":"Friedrich K.

He succeeded in 1887/88. Around 1900, Marconi established the first long distance radio communication connections. During the following five decades, analog radio communication was brought to perfection. A big change in radio development was launched by Shannon with the publication of the sampling theorem in 1949. Together with the invention of the transistor and integrated circuits this led to the establishment of digital signal processing and, emerging from this, to the overwhelming success of digital cellular mobile radio. The demand for radio systems optimally adapted to different applications (personal, office, home, car, urban, rural environments) together with economic necessities resulted in the definition of a variety of standards (DECT, GSM, UMTS, IEEE 802.11x, Bluetooth, ZigBee, ...), a development that called for SDRs. The next step in radio evolution will create devices that will help to make highest efficient use of the radio spectrum. In this scenario radios have to be aware of their location and to supervise their electromagnetic environment in order to be able to optimally adapt their transmission methods. This contribution tries to trace radio development from its origins to cognitive radio as well as to classify future developments.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562458","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562458.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562458","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Maxwell's Equations to Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"From Maxwell's Equations to Cognitive Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562458/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562458/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103253","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Maxwell's Equations to Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054775S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4562460,"authors":[{"name":"Sofie Pollin","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Belgium","University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Sofie","lastName":"Pollin","id":"37271990100"},{"name":"Ian Tan","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Tan","id":"38080985000"},{"name":"Bill Hodge","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Hodge","id":"38096307000"},{"name":"Carl Chun","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Chun","id":"38078132900"},{"name":"Ahmad Bahai","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Bahai","id":"37265187800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562460","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Interference","Wireless LAN","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Degradation","Standards development","Throughput","Testing","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal area networks","radiofrequency interference","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interoperability","heterogeneous network","asymmetric interaction pattern","listen-before-send performance","802.15.4 coexistence","802.11 coexistence"]}],"abstract":"Due to recent advances in wireless technology, a broad range of standards catering to a diverse set of users are currently emerging. Interoperability and coexistence between these heterogeneous networks are becoming key issues, and proper mitigation of these issues requires a good understanding of how and why heterogeneous networks may harm each other's p.erformance. In this paper, we focus on the coexistence of 802.11 (wireless LAN) and 802.15.4 (sensor networks) in the ISM band. These networks have very different transmission characteristics that result in asymmetric interaction patterns. Consequently, many studies assume that the impact of 802.15.4 on 802.11 is negligible. In this paper, we examine this assumption in detail and show that, in many cases, 802.15.4 significantly impacts 802.11 performance. Even when 802.15.4 is executing a listen-before-send, which should theoretically prevent interference, a significant 802.11 performance degradation frequently occurs due to disparate slot sizes between the two protocols. This is one of the first papers studying the listen-before-send performance for heterogeneous networks with substantial measured data. The results raise important coexistence issues for 802.15.4 and 802.11 in particular, but even more so for dynamic spectrum sharing between heterogeneous devices in general.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562460","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562460.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmful Coexistence Between 802.15.4 and 802.11: A Measurement-based Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Harmful Coexistence Between 802.15.4 and 802.11: A Measurement-based Study","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562460/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103255","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562460/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmful Coexistence Between 802.15.4 and 802.11: A Measurement-based Study","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045556S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562462,"authors":[{"name":"Long Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Gao","id":"37400376900"},{"name":"Shuguang Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Shuguang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37267838900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562462","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio control","Cognitive radio","Dynamic programming","Chromium","Frequency","Delay effects","Heuristic algorithms","FCC","Interference constraints","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","dynamic programming","Markov processes","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","rate control","dynamic programming approach","primary radios","PR","discrete-time Markov chain","DTMC","CR transmitters","cognitive radios"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the power and rate control schemes for multiple cognitive radio (CR) links in the same neighborhood, which operate over multiple channels (frequency bands) in the presence of licensed primary radios (PRs). Specifically, by considering a practical delay in spectrum sensing, an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP) is proposed to maximize the average sum-rate of the CR links over a finite time horizon under the constraints on the CR-to-PR interference and the average transmit power for each CR link. In the proposed algorithm, the PR occupancy of each channel is modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). Based on such a model, a novel power and rate control strategy is derived, which is a function of the delayed spectrum sensing output, the instantaneous channel gains for the CR links, and the remaining power budgets for the CR transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm leads to significant performance improvement over heuristic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562462","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562462.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562462","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and Rate Control for Cognitive Radios: A Dynamic Programming Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power and Rate Control for Cognitive Radios: A Dynamic Programming Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562462/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562462/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103256","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and Rate Control for Cognitive Radios: A Dynamic Programming Approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049888S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4562463,"authors":[{"name":"Pingzhou Tu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Pingzhou","lastName":"Tu","id":"37286852100"},{"name":"Xiaojing Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293558100"},{"name":"Eryk Dutkiewicz","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Eryk","lastName":"Dutkiewicz","id":"38299196300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562463","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference","Chromium","OFDM","Layout","Fading","Bit error rate","Wireless sensor networks","Energy management","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","fading channels","Gaussian channels","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive subband selection","OFDM","cognitive radio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","interference power level","Gaussian channel","multipath fading channel","system bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In an environment of shared radio spectrum, multiple systems may interfere with each other and cause significant impacts on system coexistence.

Under the assumption that the interference power level and the interfered frequency bands are identified at the receiver, interference thresholds, determined over both Gaussian and multipath fading channels, are applied to adaptively select the transmission subbands so that interference is avoided and the system coexistence issues are relaxed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive subband selection method, the system bit error rates (BERs) under different interference levels are simulated and compared.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562463","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Subband Selection in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radios for Better System Coexistence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562463/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Subband Selection in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radios for Better System Coexistence","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103257","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562463/","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Subband Selection in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radios for Better System Coexistence","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072386S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4562464,"authors":[{"name":"Lan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310621100"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"},{"name":"Yan Xin","affiliation":["Department of ECE, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xin","id":"37293344500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562464","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Channel state information","Chromium","Receiving antennas","Radio transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Iterative algorithms","Output feedback","Interference constraints","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","covariance analysis","iterative methods","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmission strategy","cognitive radio networks","partial channel state information","secondary user","primary user","multiple antennas","single receive antenna","optimal transmit signal covariance","average interference power constraint","iterative algorithms"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Transmission Strategy for Cognitive Radio Networks with Partial Channel State Information","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562464.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562464","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562464","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a spectrum sharing based cognitive radio (CR) network where the secondary user (SU) coexists with the primary user (PU) as long as the interference power received by the PU is less than a acceptable threshold. Suppose that the SU's transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas and the PU's receiver are equipped with single receive antenna. We assume that the SU's channel state information (CSI) is known at the SU transmitter perfectly, however, due to less cooperation between the SU and the PU, only partial CSI between SU and PU is available at the SU transmitter. We seek to determine the optimal transmit signal covariance to maximize the transmission rate of the SU where the covariance is subject to the average interference power constraint of the PU as well as the transmit power constraint of the SU transmitter. Two iterative algorithms are proposed to solve these problems, and it is shown that the algorithms can converge to the optimal solution.

In this paper, we propose an orthogonal beamforming methodology which enables cognitive radio systems to coexist with primary users' systems in the same spectrum and region with no interference to the primary users' systems. The orthogonal beams are obtained using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization based on primary users' channel state information. In addition, to increase the sum-rate of the CR systems, the proposed scheme adopts an opportunistic beamforming method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme does not cause interference to the primary users and provides higher sum-rate capacity than that of conventional CR

CRs can utilize spectral opportunities when and where Licensed Systems (LS) remain idle, operating in an overlay mode under the major restriction of not causing harmful interference to them. In this Paper, first, we investigate the IEEE 802.11 DCF behavior in the overlay network, in terms of interference caused to the LS. The importance of the three way hand shake mechanism in the overlay scenario is discovered. Then, we introduce a 3rd state to the carrier sensing mechanism of the CR stations and we extend the DCF functionality by exploiting the new state. Two new protocols that utilize the new mechanism are proposed, both of which achieve substantial reduction in the interference caused to the LS. The second protocol also improves the performance of the CR Network in terms of throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562472/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10103263","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562472/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Methods for Reducing Interference caused to Licensed Systems by Overlay-CSMA/CA Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods for Reducing Interference caused to Licensed Systems by Overlay-CSMA/CA Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044101S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562473,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Yang","affiliation":["Ministry ofEducation, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37655469900"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Yabin Ye","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Italy"],"firstName":"Yabin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37279356900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562473","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference constraints","Interference suppression","Cognitive radio","Frequency","Interference cancellation","Bit error rate","Protection","Narrowband","Block codes","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","multiband-OFDM UWB","cognitive radio systems","low density parity check-like modulation scheme","mathematical expression","side-band interferences","constraint relationship","design process","bit rate error","narrow band radio systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MB-OFDM UWB based","cognitive radio","interfrences","constraints","LDPC-like modulation scheme"]}],"abstract":"A mathematical expression of side-band interferences caused by sub-carriers of multi-band (MB)-OFDM UWB based cognitive radio is derived.

With modulation schemes of this type, the bit rate error (BER) performance of MB-OFDM UWB based cognitive radio systems is improved, and simultaneously, the side-band signals decrease more quickly.

The primary user has preemptive priority over secondary user, while the same priority level users are FIFO served. This paper models the CR system based on scheduling technology. The secondary users are further divided into different priority levels. A hybrid priority dynamic policy, which indicates primary user's preemptive priority and secondary user's nonpreemptive priority, is developed to reduce spectrum switch overhead during spectrum leasing process. Theoretical analyzing shows that hybrid priority reduces the spectrum switch overhead and the hybrid priority improvement is a non-negative mono-increasing function of priority level. Based on the proposed policy, CR scheduling model is built and CR scheduling rule is provided and proved. Experimental comparison between CR scheduling and priority queue shows that CR scheduling gets a smaller weighted staying time sum than priority queue and the improvement increases as system becomes more congested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562478/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10103269","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562478/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling Model for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling Model for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05275S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4562479,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Timmers","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Timmers","id":"37594649900"},{"name":"Sofie Pollin","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium","University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sofie","lastName":"Pollin","id":"37271990100"},{"name":"Antoine Dejonghe","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Dejonghe","id":"37269578900"},{"name":"Ahmad Bahai","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Bahai","id":"37265187800"},{"name":"Liesbet Van der Perre","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Liesbet","lastName":"Van der Perre","id":"37271995400"},{"name":"Francky Catthoor","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Francky","lastName":"Catthoor","id":"37275971400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562479","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference constraints","FCC","USA Councils","Electronic mail","Protection","Network topology","Acceleration","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","accumulative interference modeling","distributed channel access scheme","IEEE 802.11 standard","network topology","collision avoidance"]}],"abstract":"A cognitive radio (CR) network should be able to sense its environment and adapt its communication to utilize unused licensed spectrum without interfering with incumbents. Properly modeling the expected interference from the CR network is therefore very important in the definition of coexistence rules to efficiently protect the incumbents. In this paper we model the accumulative interference generated from a large-scale CR network and investigate how this affects the sensing requirements of the CRs to meet an interference constraint. More specifically, our model considers the impact of discrete topology and the impact of the distributed channel access scheme. As an instantiation of our model, we consider a CR network based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. We show that the interference generated is large, since collisions cannot be avoided.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562479","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562479.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562479","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accumulative Interference Modeling for Cognitive Radios with Distributed Channel Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Accumulative Interference Modeling for Cognitive Radios with Distributed Channel Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562479/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562479/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103270","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accumulative Interference Modeling for Cognitive Radios with Distributed Channel Access","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.209729S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562481,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Jung","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl fur KommunikationsTechnik, Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Jung","id":"37285068000"},{"name":"Alexander Viessmann","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl fur KommunikationsTechnik, Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Viessmann","id":"37392147400"},{"name":"Christoph Spiegel","affiliation":["Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Spiegel","id":"37299553000"},{"name":"Admir Burnic","affiliation":["Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Admir","lastName":"Burnic","id":"37299554600"},{"name":"Zijian Bai","affiliation":["Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Zijian","lastName":"Bai","id":"37394775500"},{"name":"Guido H.

System designers may easily come up with TPC (transmission power control) applied to the down-streams of a network, to increase the cell reuse factor, but this scheme alone is likely to encounter initial access issues where beacons are not either receivable or decodable inside the network's maximum transmission range. Such problems can be handled in two major approaches: first, relaying beacons in a distributed manner to statistically sweep out hidden areas; and second, explicit demand of beacons from a connecting device. The latter is called active scan (or sending probes) and can guarantee successful connections to the network if, and only if, appropriate mechanisms are provided to avoid interference to neighboring networks. In that context, we will explore a wide span of DSA (dynamic spectrum access) techniques and introduce a system, called DPA (discrete probe access)-OFDMA, where probe frames are transmitted with orthogonality maintained in the power and code domain. A group of cognitive techniques to boost the efficiency of active scans will be presented too.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562489","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562489.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562489","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Techniques: TPC-resilient Initial Access in Open Spectrum Bands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Techniques: TPC-resilient Initial Access in Open Spectrum Bands","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562489/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562489/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103278","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Techniques: TPC-resilient Initial Access in Open Spectrum Bands","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085003S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562491,"authors":[{"name":"Seungmo Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungmo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37675544800"},{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281364300"},{"name":"Yonghoon Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yonghoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37334942700"},{"name":"Jongmin Lee","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongmin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292730000"},{"name":"Youngnam Han","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngnam","lastName":"Han","id":"37280849300"},{"name":"Insun Lee","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Insun","lastName":"Lee","id":"38089079200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562491","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Performance analysis","Cognitive radio","Cellular networks","Relays","Probability","Pattern analysis","Performance gain","Bandwidth","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","cognitive radio","probability","radio links","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","downlink performance analysis","cellular relay network","statistical analysis","outage probability","system capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay","downlink","cognitive radio","capacity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562491","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562491","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","abstract":"In this paper, we propose two operating scenarios of employing cognitive radio to downlink of relay networks.

The capacity gain over conventional relay is investigated in terms of the normalized system capacity. We first statistically model the spectrum usage pattern in those bands and derive the achievable data rate and outage probability in order to analyze performance gain in the view of practical system establishment. Then, we define system capacity by normalizing the effect of bandwidth so that a fair comparison of performance is accomplished. Through our analysis and simulations, it is shown that the proposed scenarios are able to achieve significant gains over a conventional cellular relay system in terms of the normalized system capacity. As a result, relay combined with cognitive radio can be considered as a viable solution to get higher downlink capacity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562491.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Performance Analysis of Cognitive Radio based Cellular Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562491/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Performance Analysis of Cognitive Radio based Cellular Relay Networks","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103280","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Performance Analysis of Cognitive Radio based Cellular Relay Networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096593S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562495,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyuan Yang","affiliation":["School of Information of Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Ziyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"38089820100"},{"name":"Haixia Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information of Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Haixia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280795800"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information of Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"},{"name":"Zhiquan Bai","affiliation":["School of Information of Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Zhiquan","lastName":"Bai","id":"37286735500"},{"name":"Kyungsup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB Wireless Communications Research Center INHA UWB-ITRC, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungsup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562495","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is one of the important paradigms proposed by FCC for improving the spectrum utilization.

In this paper we propose a subband adaptive filtering method for effective spectrum access and dynamic spectrum sharing in cognitive radios (CR). Based on an interleaved spread spectrum orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ISS-OFDM) multiple subband transmission signal and subband adaptive filtering technique, some interfered subbands of the transmission signal are filtered and dropped off. The other subbands without interference or with interference less than a predetermined threshold are used for information transmission. The flexibility of the adaptively selecting transmission subbands provides users with the ability to fill in spectrum holes with appropriate number of subbands. Consequently, the spectrum utilization efficiency is improved. We simulate the system bit error rate (BER) performances and demonstrate the improvement on spectrum utilization efficiency by using this subband adaptive filtering method, when different numbers of subbands are used for information transmission.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562499","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562499.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband Adaptive Filtering for Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562499/","displayDocTitle":"Subband Adaptive Filtering for Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive Radios","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103193","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562499/","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband Adaptive Filtering for Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0816S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":4562502,"authors":[{"name":"Kazunori Takeuchi","affiliation":["YRP Research Center, KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37391081000"},{"name":"Shoji Kaneko","affiliation":["YRP Research Center, KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37409049400"},{"name":"Shinichi Nomoto","affiliation":["YRP Research Center, KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichi","lastName":"Nomoto","id":"37284434800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562502","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":604},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562502","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Accuracy","Nonhomogeneous media","Predictive models","Wireless communication","Availability","Working environment noise","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","cognitive radio","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio environment prediction","cognitive radio","transmission capability","AR model","autoregressive model","heterogeneous wireless communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio environment","prediction","Hurst parameter","AR model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562502","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562502.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio Environment Prediction for Cognitive Radio","abstract":"The evaluation and the prediction of the radio environment is one of the key issues to improve the cognitive radio.

In this paper, unlike a primary/secondary model, cognitive radio is defined as wireless communication technology in which each node communicates via an optimal wireless system based on recognition of radio resource availability in heterogeneous wireless communication systems. Therefore, it is important to be able to recognize such radio resource availability accurately. However, a cognitive radio node is unable to recognize the subsequent radio resource availability at the time of selecting the optimal wireless system. The authors focus on the prediction of radio resource availability to resolve the above issue. In this paper, the authors focus on IEEE802.11 and radio channel occupation time, which is calculated from packet length and the transmission rate, is used as radio resource availability. From the results of the examination, it would seem feasible that the auto-correlation coefficient (or partial auto-correlation coefficient) could be utilized as information on the reliability of the prediction value when an auto-regression model (AR model) is used for the prediction. Furthermore, by comparing n-step-ahead prediction for a time series calculated for a 1-second interval and 1-step-ahead prediction for a time series calculated for an n-second interval, it is shown that the accuracy of the prediction in both cases is almost identical when the information volume to calculate a prediction expression is the same. Therefore, either prediction approach can be selected depending on the cognitive radio system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562504/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10103197","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562504/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Radio Resource Availability in Cognitive Radio - an Experimental Examination","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Radio Resource Availability in Cognitive Radio - an Experimental Examination","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112974S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4562505,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Long","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Long","id":"38094080000"},{"name":"Xiaoying Gan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoying","lastName":"Gan","id":"37291571900"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications, Nanjing Institute of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China","Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277724400"},{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405247500"},{"name":"Meixia Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meixia","lastName":"Tao","id":"37283006000"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications, Nanjing Institute of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085924472"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562505","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State estimation","Cognitive radio","Mathematical model","Maximum likelihood estimation","Probability","Computational modeling","Hardware","Markov processes","Statistics","Gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cognitive radio","Markov processes","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation algorithm","channel state transition probabilities","cognitive radio systems","Markov channel model","partially observable Markov decision process","maximum likelihood method","central limit theorem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation","Cognitive Radio","POMDP","Channel State Transition Probability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Estimation Algorithm of Channel State Transition Probabilities for Cognitive Radio Systems","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562505.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562505","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562505","abstract":"In this paper, an estimation algorithm of channel state transition probabilities in Markov channel model for cognitive radio systems is proposed.

In this paper, we propose a spectrum aware on-demand routing which doesn't base on control channel. A channel assignment algorithm aimed at improving link utilization is derived from delay-analysis. The overhead and gain by switching are balanced in this algorithm. For deafness problem caused by switching can result in significant performance degradation, constraints to avoid the appearance of deafness in channel assignment process are given. We stress that our approach can be easily implemented for the using of standard IEEE 802.11DCF. Results of simulation show that, our approach can well fit MSCRN and improve the network throughput comparing to the same network scenario without cognitive ability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10103201","htmlLink":"/document/4562509/","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Aware Routing for Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks with a Single Transceiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Aware Routing for Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks with a Single Transceiver","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050138S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4562510,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Liu","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37558477000"},{"name":"David Grace","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Grace","id":"37269106100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562510","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562510","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Routing","Cognitive radio","Ad hoc networks","Relays","Scalability","Telecommunication traffic","Mobile ad hoc networks","Interference","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless ad hoc communications","cognitive routing","capacity-based routing strategy","network traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive networking","cognitive radio","ad hoc networking","wireless routing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562510","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Capacity for Wireless Ad Hoc Communications Using Cognitive Routing","abstract":"This paper is devoted to the development of cognitive routing techniques for a wireless ad hoc network in order to improve scalability and effectively the supportable capacity.

It can also support more originating capacity compared with the shortest path routing strategy where each node has a maximum capacity constraint.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562510/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10103202","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562510/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving Capacity for Wireless Ad Hoc Communications Using Cognitive Routing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Capacity for Wireless Ad Hoc Communications Using Cognitive Routing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03881S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562516,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Gong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Gong","id":"37647956400"},{"name":"Jie Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory ofCommunications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Chen","id":"37656881300"},{"name":"Wanbin Tang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory ofCommunications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wanbin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37279991300"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory ofCommunications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562516","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Paper technology","Base stations","Frequency","Clustering algorithms","Stability","Ad hoc networks","Numerical simulation","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical spectrum sharing network","cognitive radio","sensing spectrum expenditure","clustering stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Hiearchical spectrum sharing network","Clustering","Clustering stability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of clustering structure in the hierarchical spectrum sharing network based on cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562516.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562516","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562516","abstract":"This paper firstly analyzes the impact which clustering and non-clustering structure is on sensing spectrum expenditure.

Test Based on Finding the Optimum Lag in Cyclic Autocorrelation for Detecting Free Bands in Cognitive Radios","abstract":"Cognitive radios sense the radio spectrum in order to find free bands for transmission. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for detecting free bands by exploiting a statistical test based on finding the optimum lag in cyclic autocorrelation of primary user signals within the framework of cyclostationarity theory. This approach has a satisfying detecting performance under low SNR conditions and is computational efficient. Meanwhile, due to signals' cyclostationarity, the method also has a good anti-interference property which can be utilized to detect the primary user signals in the presence of interference. Finally, simulations are performed to verify those properties of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562528/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10103216","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562528/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Test Based on Finding the Optimum Lag in Cyclic Autocorrelation for Detecting Free Bands in Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Test Based on Finding the Optimum Lag in Cyclic Autocorrelation for Detecting Free Bands in Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10142S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562529,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, China Wireless Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37654362900"},{"name":"Luyong Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, China Wireless Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Luyong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292620200"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, China Wireless Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Yabin Ye","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Italy"],"firstName":"Yabin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37279356900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562529","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Radio transmitters","Resource management","Signal processing","Receivers","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Computer vision","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive MB-OFDM UWB radio","beacon signals","acknowledgement signals","radio transmitter","radio receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive MB-OFDM UWB Radio (CUWB)","active spectrum sensing","beacon signals","acknowledgement signals"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum awareness is the key technique for Cognitive Radio (CR). A special spectrum sensing scheme is necessary for Cognitive UWB radio (CUWB) because of its lower radio power and ultra wide bandwidth. Although CUWB transmitter and receiver could respectively detect the spectrum holes, they couldn't communicate with each other probably if they are out of the communication range or there isn't common usable spectrum segment for them. No sensing technique deals with these problems properly. In this paper a novel active spectrum sensing scheme for cognitive MB-OFDM UWB radio is presented to settle the above problems. The scheme takes full advantage of UWB and finds usable channels directly for CUWB transmitter and receiver through sending beacon signals and acknowledgement signals. This active spectrum sensing scheme is totally different from existing sensing methods and has its own advantages.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Active Spectrum Sensing Scheme for Cognitive MB-OFDM UWB Radio","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562529","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562529.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Active Spectrum Sensing Scheme for Cognitive MB-OFDM UWB Radio","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562529/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103217","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Active Spectrum Sensing Scheme for Cognitive MB-OFDM UWB Radio","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100724S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4562530,"authors":[{"name":"Akio Kobori","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Akio","lastName":"Kobori","id":"38096540000"},{"name":"Yohei Kato","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Kato","id":"38084878800"},{"name":"Yukitoshi Sanada","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukitoshi","lastName":"Sanada","id":"37269451300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562530","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Sampling methods","Band pass filters","OFDM","Bandwidth","Baseband","Interference","Computational modeling","Europe","4G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","sampling methods","signal detection","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection scheme","MB-OFDM receivers","fractional sampling","detect and avoid techniques","UWB","4th generation mobile communication systems","multipath scheme","false detection","false alarm","DFT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","MB-OFDM","Fractional Sampling","4G","DAA"]}],"abstract":"Currently, detect and avoid (DAA) techniques of UWB have been paid large attention because it has been regulated in Japan and Europe.

The numerical results show that the proposed scheme with fractional sampling improves the probability of false detection by about 10 times as compared to conventional schemes.

Wireless devices that can learn from their environment can also be taught things by malicious elements of their environment. By putting artificial intelligence in charge of wireless network devices, we are allowing unanticipated, emergent behavior, fitting a perhaps distorted or manipulated level of optimality. The state space for a cognitive radio is made up of a variety of learned beliefs and current sensor inputs. By manipulating radio sensor inputs, an adversary can affect the beliefs of a radio, and consequently its behavior. In this paper we focus primarily on PHY-layer issues, describing several classes of attacks and giving specific examples for dynamic spectrum access and adaptive radio scenarios. These attacks demonstrate the capabilities of an attacker who can manipulate the spectral environment when a radio is learning. The most powerful of which is a self-propagating AI virus that could interactively teach radios to become malicious. We then describe some approaches for mitigating the effectiveness of these attacks by instilling some level of \"common sense\" into radio systems, and requiring learned beliefs to expire and be relearned. Lastly we provide a road-map for extending these ideas to higher layers in the network stack.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562534/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10103221","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562534/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Security in Cognitive Radio Networks: Threats and Mitigation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in Cognitive Radio Networks: Threats and Mitigation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052981S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4562535,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The cognitive radio paradigm introduces entirely new classes of security threats and challenges, and providing strong security may prove to be the most difficult aspect of making cognitive radio a long-term commercially-viable concept. This paper delineates the key challenges in providing security in cognitive networks, discusses the current security posture of the emerging IEEE 802.22 cognitive radio standard, and identifies potential vulnerabilities along with potential mitigation approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562536/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10103223","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562536/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Security in Cognitive Radio Networks: The Required Evolution in Approaches to Wireless Network Security","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in Cognitive Radio Networks: The Required Evolution in Approaches to Wireless Network Security","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055079S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4562537,"authors":[{"name":"Fangmin Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Wireless Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Fangmin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37289604500"},{"name":"Luyong Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Wireless Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Luyong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292620200"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Yabin Ye","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Italy","CREATE-NET, Italy"],"firstName":"Yabin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37279356900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562537","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":435},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Next generation networking","Wireless networks","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Intelligent networks","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Communications technology","Frequency","Internetworking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","IP networks","mobile radio","multimedia communication","radio access networks","telecommunication security","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next-generation reconfigurable wireless networks","cognitive radio","mobile communications","wireless communications","wireless access networks","IP multimedia subsystem","3GPP system","Wimax system","resource management","security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Reconfigurability","IMS","3GPP","Wimax"]}],"abstract":"The next generation of wireless networks, as envisioned by recent advances in cognitive radio (CR) technologies, will be intelligently adjust their configuration to changes in the communication environment.

In next generation of reconfigurable wireless networks, various wireless access networks coexist in the same frequency band using cognitive radio and internetworking using IP multimedia subsystem (IMS).

A mandatory requirement for any wireless technology operating in these bands is that it shall not cause harmful interfere with the passive TV receivers.

For a scenario where only mean channel gains from secondary users to primary receiving points, which are averaged over short-term fading, are available, we derive outage probabilities for secondary users and interference constraint violation probabilities for primary users. Based on the analysis, we develop a framework to perform joint admission control and rate/power allocation for secondary users such that statistical guarantees on the violation probabilities of both the QoS and the interference constraints are achieved. Spectrum access by the secondary users can exploit the time-varying nature of the activity of the primary users, and thereby much higher throughput can be achieved compared to the case where primary users are assumed to be active at all time. Also, via extensive numerical analysis, throughput performances of primary and secondary users are investigated considering different levels of implementation complexity due to channel estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562545/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10103230","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562545/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Cognitive Radios in Dynamic Spectrum Access Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Cognitive Radios in Dynamic Spectrum Access Environment","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052521S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4562546,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Tuan Hoang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Anh Tuan","lastName":"Hoang","id":"38187051700"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562546","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562546","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Resource management","Downlink","Time-varying channels","Nash equilibrium","Frequency","Cost accounting","Interference constraints","Marketing and sales","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","radio spectrum management","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic spectrum allocation","second-price auctions","dynamic spectrum access scenario","time-varying channel","base station collects","transmission rights","Nash equilibrium bidding strategies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562546","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562546.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Allocation with Second-Price Auctions: When Time is Money","abstract":"We consider a dynamic spectrum access scenario in which transmission opportunities are allocated to users based on a second price, sealed bid auction. Each user experiences a time-varying channel and submits a bid for transmission right in each time slot. A base station collects bids from all users and allocates the channel to a user with the highest bid, who then pays the price equal the second highest bid. The distinctive feature of our model is that it treats time as money and allows each user to bid and to pay for the transmission rights using his/her own communication time. For each time slot, the value of a bid submitted by each user is equal the amount of time he/she promises to forfeit to the base station for the right to transmit during the remaining of the time slot. That means the base station collects part of each time slot from the winning user for its own usage and allocates the rest to the winning user. Users can vary their bids based on their channel conditions, subject to constraints on average budgets. From the users' point of view, we show that there exists Nash equilibrium bidding strategies in the two-user case. From the base station's point of view, we investigate how average budget constraints should be set to balance between base station's revenue and users' satisfaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562546/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10090813","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562546/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Allocation with Second-Price Auctions: When Time is Money","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Allocation with Second-Price Auctions: When Time is Money","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077188S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4562548,"authors":[{"name":"Dawei Chen","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37533344200"},{"name":"Qian Zhang","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289940400"},{"name":"Weijia Jia","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Jia","id":"37266130300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562548","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":654},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Wireless networks","Bandwidth","OFDM","Cognitive radio","Availability","Protocols","Data communication","Aggregates","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aggregation aware spectrum assignment","cognitive ad-hoc networks","wireless radio technology","discontiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","DOFDM","discontiguous spectrum access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AASA","Wireless Networks","Cognitive Radio","Spectrum Aggregation","DOFDM"]}],"abstract":"Contiguous spectrum assignment generates many small spectrum fragments that cannot be fully utilized, which leads to low spectrum utilization. With the development of advanced wireless radio technology, especially Discontiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DOFDM), discontiguous spectrum access and spectrum aggregation in a single radio has become possible. With the help of discontiguous spectrum access, the small spectrum fragments could be aggregated and further utilized, which can dramatically improve the spectrum utilization efficiency. Based on this observation, we propose Aggregation-Aware Spectrum Assignment (AASA), a spectrum assignment algorithm in cognitive ad-hoc networks. In AASA, we propose a spectrum assignment method that takes spectrum aggregation into consideration. Moreover, we prove that AASA optimizes the spectrum assignment and maximizes the number of users that can be supported in the system.

In a DSA network, multi-carrier based cognitive radio transceivers need to deactivate some of its subcarriers to avoid interference to primary users. However, by deactivating subcarriers, orthogonality among different spreading codes are lost, leading to poor BER performance. The performance of the NC-MC-CDMA can be improved by adaptive spreading code adjustment to compensate for the loss of orthogonality. However, since Hadamard-Walsh codes only exist for certain code length, loss of orthogonality can only be minimized instead of eliminated for many cases. On the other hand, orthogonal Carrier Interferometry codes exist for code length of any integer. Hence, by applying non-contiguous CI/MC-CDMA into DSA, the loss of orthogonality among spreading codes caused by deactivating subcarriers can be eliminated. As a direct result, adaptive NC-CI/MC-CDMA significantly outperforms adaptive NC-MC-CDMA using Hadamard-Walsh codes.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562551","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562551.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Adaptive Non-contiguous MC-CDMA and Non-contiguous CI/MC-CDMA for Dynamic Spectrum Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562551/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Adaptive Non-contiguous MC-CDMA and Non-contiguous CI/MC-CDMA for Dynamic Spectrum Access","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103234","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562551/","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Adaptive Non-contiguous MC-CDMA and Non-contiguous CI/MC-CDMA for Dynamic Spectrum Access","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115777S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4543883","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4562434","articleId":"4562551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4562552,"authors":[{"name":"Joy Iong-Zong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Chunghua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Joy Iong-Zong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37068913200"},{"name":"Chin-Chung Yu","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Chunghua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Chung","lastName":"Yu","id":"38257376500"},{"name":"You-Fu Chung","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Chunghua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"You-Fu","lastName":"Chung","id":"38255252200"},{"name":"Shi-Han Yan","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Chunghua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shi-Han","lastName":"Yan","id":"38256733400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562552","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Diversity reception","Weibull fading channels","System performance","Nakagami distribution","Bit error rate","Interference","Wireless communication","Weibull distribution","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","OFDM modulation","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM communication system","carrier frequency offset","CFO","unequal gain diversity scheme","small-term fading correlated channel","dual branch selection combining diversity","bit error rate","BER","Q-function","correlated-Weibull fading distribution","fading channel propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","SC selection combining","Weibull fading","CFO (carrier frequency offset)"]}],"abstract":"The system performance of OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) with dual branch SC (selection combining) diversity over small scale fading correlated channel is investigated in this paper.

Normally the fusion network is in parallel configuration and the conventional fusion rules are the k out of N rules because of their simplicity to manage. When the detection nodes are similar with each other i.e. their observations are from same probability distribution, the k out of N rules can make improvement to detection performance since they are equivalent to Neyman-Pearson criteria in this case. However the detection performance decreases greatly when the detection nodes are dissimilar due to fading and shadowing of radio channels especially when most of them are at low SNR states. The hierarchy fusion scheme we proposed in this paper incorporates both parallel and serial configuration and classifies detection nodes into different groups by their SNR levels. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of hierarchy fusion rule shows that the detection efficiency and reliability can be increased no matter the detection nodes are similar or dissimilar.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562559","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543883/4562434/04562559.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562559","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection Fusion by Hierarchy Rule for Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Detection Fusion by Hierarchy Rule for Cognitive Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562559/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562559/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103241","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection Fusion by Hierarchy Rule for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"CROWNCOM-00-125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040971S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2008","isNumber":"4562434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4543883","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4562559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4562561,"authors":[{"name":"Vijaykumar Kuppusamy","affiliation":["Applied Research Group, Satyam Computer Services Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Vijaykumar","lastName":"Kuppusamy","id":"38096673600"},{"name":"Rajarshi Mahapatra","affiliation":["Applied Research Group, Satyam Computer Services Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Rajarshi","lastName":"Mahapatra","id":"37340877100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2301-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"4562561","dbTime":"43 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":940},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Detectors","Receivers","Interference","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["primary user detection","OFDM","MIMO cognitive radio","energy detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Spectrum sensing","OFDM","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In order to detect the presence of the primary user signal with high probability, spectrum sensing is a fundamental requirement to achieve the goal of cognitive radio (CR).

In the first release of high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) specification the highest supported modulation scheme, 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM), might not be efficient enough to fully exploit the superior signal quality offered by the femto base stations making the use of a higher order modulation desirable. This paper presents a performance evaluation of using higher order modulation scheme, namely 64QAM, with HSDPA in a combined single frequency macro and femto cell scenario with advanced receivers used at mobile terminals. The impact of femto cells and 64QAM is also analyzed as a function of indoor user penetration. The analysis is done using dynamic system level simulations.","doi":"10.1109/INCC.2008.4562690","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Networking and Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Networking and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4545866/4562662/04562690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INCC.2008.4562690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562662","startPage":"49","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing Femto Cell Throughput with HSDPA Using Higher Order Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Increasing Femto Cell Throughput with HSDPA Using Higher Order Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562690/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103294","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562690/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing Femto Cell Throughput with HSDPA Using Higher Order Modulation","confLoc":"Lahore, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"INCC-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060859S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4545866","isNumber":"4562662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4545866","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4562662","articleId":"4562690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4562697,"authors":[{"name":"Jyotsna L.

The effective channel response length is required to be shorter than the cyclic prefix inserted between OFDM symbols to reduce inter-symbol interference. Various optimum/suboptimum techniques have been explored in literature to determine the channel shortening filter response, which is also referred to as the time domain equalizer (TEQ). In this paper, we propose a novel frequency domain approach to the problem of estimating the TEQ response, when the channel characteristics are unknown. This iterative approach provides faster and better convergence as well as better control over effective sub-channel response compared to its time domain counterpart, at a relatively low computational cost. The simulation results are shown as applied to wired communication systems but could be easily extended for any OFDM based system.","doi":"10.1109/INCC.2008.4562697","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Networking and Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Networking and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4545866/4562662/04562697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INCC.2008.4562697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562662","startPage":"85","endPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Frequency Domain Approach to Channel Shortening in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Frequency Domain Approach to Channel Shortening in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562697/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10090817","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Frequency Domain Approach to Channel Shortening in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Lahore, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"INCC-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043928S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4545866","isNumber":"4562662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4545866","xplore-issue":"4562662","articleId":"4562697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4562719,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In wireless systems, bandwidth is a scarce resource that needs to be used in an effective manner. Subscriber mobility also makes resource allocation a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an adaptive dynamic resource allocation policy based on a neural network demand prediction scheme for cellular wireless systems. Unlike some other proposed schemes, we do not require knowledge of the position and velocity of every mobile subscriber in the network. This greatly reduces signaling and computational overhead and results in a policy that is simple to implement. We perform a simulation study to compare the proposed scheme with other adaptive resource allocation schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562719/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10059607","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562719/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Demand Prediction Scheme for Resource Allocation in Cellular Wireless Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Demand Prediction Scheme for Resource Allocation in Cellular Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"TPSD-00-9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049116S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4538204","isNumber":"4562710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4538204","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4562710","articleId":"4562719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4562722,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Dornajafi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mahsa Dornajafi was at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) when this work was done and received a B.S in electrical engineering with honors.

In order to solve the permutation ambiguity, the final value of the ICA derived separation matrix of one frequency bin, is used to initialize the ICA iterations in the next frequency bin. The amplitude problem is addressed by utilizing the elements in the inverse of the separation matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that successful separation is achieved and compared with conventional frequency-domain BSS methods, it is less computationally complex and has faster convergence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast and Efficient Frequency-Domain Method for Convolutive Blind Source Separation","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 5 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TPSD.2008.4562739","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 5 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4538204/4562710/04562739.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPSD.2008.4562739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Fast and Efficient Frequency-Domain Method for Convolutive Blind Source Separation","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562739/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10059626","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast and Efficient Frequency-Domain Method for Convolutive Blind Source Separation","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"TPSD-00-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039858S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4538204","isNumber":"4562710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4538204","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4562710","articleId":"4562739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4562743,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A solution to this is the use of Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) as design tool. This paper describes the realization of an 8-bit FPGA based simple processor.

So the customer security devices such as smart cards and security processors are prone to attack and there are on going research to protect these devices from attackers who intend to extract key information from these devices. Also an active attacker can induce errors during computation and exploit the faulty result to extract the key information embedded in the processor. Due to the design time issues weakness in the design is often revealed in the manufactured chips. Also because the post- manufacture security evaluation is time consuming and expensive, these security issues have to be considered at the design phase. This paper outlines some of the hardware attacks and provides a general idea of the process of these attacks.","doi":"10.1109/TPSD.2008.4562750","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 5 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 5 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4538204/4562710/04562750.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPSD.2008.4562750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562710","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secured Hardware Design - An Overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secured Hardware Design - An Overview","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562750/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10059637","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562750/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secured Hardware Design - An Overview","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"TPSD-00-40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061114S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4538204","isNumber":"4562710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4538204","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4562710","articleId":"4562750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4562778,"authors":[{"name":"F.E. van Vliet","affiliation":["Security and Safety, TNO Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, Netherlands"],"firstName":"F.E.","lastName":"van Vliet","id":"37266746500"},{"name":"A.P. de Hek","affiliation":["Security and Safety, TNO Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, Netherlands"],"firstName":"A.P.","lastName":"de Hek","id":"37610862500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2098-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4562778","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Optical beams","Hardware","Radio frequency","Space technology","Degradation","Phased arrays","Optical transmitters","Optical attenuators","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["front-end technology","phased-arrays","digital beamforming","antenna beams"]}],"abstract":"Phased-arrays are widely used in the military and space domain.

With advanced technology, reduced channel size, novel designs extending the more established pixels based on three transistors (3T design) into four transistors (4T design employing pinned photodiodes), the performance keeps improving [1-2]. Noise sets a limit on image sensor performance, mainly under conditions of low illumination. Analysis of noise in CMOS APS has been reported by several authors. In this paper, we present an analysis of noise due to thermal, 1/f and shot noise sources in two types of APS, known as the 3T and 4T pixel design, based on a unified time-dependent approach, using the separation of the system into two parts: time-invariant part (the APS without switching) and a time-variant part (taking into consideration the switching process).system. To calculate explicit noise expressions for noise performance we, therefore, resort to time dependent circuit models and perform time-domain noise analysis, taking into account the stationary nature of the various noise processes. The main advantage of the present method is that it is mathematically correct and avoids a basic flaw underlining the widely-used conventional methods (that freely use time- invariant methods for time-dependent systems).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of noise in CMOS image sensor","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2008.4562800","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554521/4562772/04562800.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2008.4562800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562772","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of noise in CMOS image sensor","conferenceDate":"13-14 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4562800/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103541","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of noise in CMOS image sensor","confLoc":"Tel-Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"SPI-07032008-00028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040568S","chronDate":"13-14 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554521","isNumber":"4562772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554521","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4562772","articleId":"4562800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4562810,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Although CMOS base band chips continue down the path of lower cost and smaller form factor, the scaling and cost of Front End Modules (FEMs) and RF transceivers pose a challenge. In a typical 3G WEDGE handset the front end may contain up to 5 discrete power amplifiers, along with an antenna switch and various integrated passives all fabricated in GaAs technology. GaAs based technologies present a barrier to full scale integration of FEMs and transceivers. Silicon Germanium (SiGe) technology facilitates integration of the FEM and radio transceivers, in effect lowering the overall system cost while reducing the form factor. This paper demonstrates the potential of 0.18\u03bc SiGe based HBTs as an alternative to GaAs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 May 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562833/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103572","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Silicon Germanium process technology for wireless Front End Modules and power amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon Germanium process technology for wireless Front End Modules and power amplifiers","confLoc":"Tel-Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"SPI-07032008-00061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03487S","chronDate":"13-14 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554521","isNumber":"4562772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554521","xplore-issue":"4562772","articleId":"4562833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4562944,"authors":[{"name":"Zeynep D.

Therefore, it is important to develop methods for distinguishing between actual photographs from digital cameras and computer generated images. We describe a novel approach to this problem. Rather than focusing on the statistical differences between the image textures, we recognize that images from digital cameras contain traces of resampling as a result of using a color filter array with demosaicing algorithms. We recognize that estimation of the actual demosaicing parameters is not necessary; rather, detection of the presence of demosaicing is the key. The in-camera processing (rather than the image content) distinguishes the digital camera photographs from computer graphics. Our results show high reliability on a standard test set of JPEG compressed images from consumer digital cameras. Further, we show the application of these ideas for accurately localizing forged regions within digital camera images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4562984","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04562984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4562984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image authentication by detecting traces of demosaicing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4562984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image authentication by detecting traces of demosaicing","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4562984/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104335","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4562984/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image authentication by detecting traces of demosaicing","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058805S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4562984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563014,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Huang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, UBC-TRIUMF, Canada"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401557000"},{"name":"Rafeef Abugharbieh","affiliation":["Department of ECE, UBC-TRIUMF, Canada"],"firstName":"Rafeef","lastName":"Abugharbieh","id":"37296738700"},{"name":"Roger Tam","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, UBC-TRIUMF, Canada"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Tam","id":"37267823200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2339-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2340-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4563014","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Hidden Markov models","Magnetic resonance imaging","Shape","Lattices","Parameter estimation","Labeling","Brain modeling","Solid modeling","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","expectation-maximisation algorithm","hidden Markov models","image segmentation","medical image processing","optimisation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised image segmentation","image representation","rectangular lattice","optimization process","tree-structured parameter estimation algorithm","locally optimal data labeling","clinical magnetic resonance imaging","gray matter segmentation","expectation-maximization hidden Markov random field","3D region-based hidden Markov model","optimal data labeling","object rotation","synthetic image","clinical magnetic resonance imaging data","geometric shape data","grid-based HMM framework","brain MRI data","white matter segmentation","3D HMM estimation"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel three dimensional (3D) region-based hidden Markov model (rbHMM) for unsupervised image segmentation. Our contributions are twofold. First, our rbHMM employs a more efficient representation of the image than approaches based on a rectangular lattice or grid; thus, resulting in a faster optimization process. Second, our proposed novel tree-structured parameter estimation algorithm for the rbHMM provides a locally optimal data labeling that is invariant to object rotation. We demonstrate the advantages of our segmentation technique by validating on synthetic images of geometric shapes as well as both simulated and clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the brain. For the geometric shape data, we show that our method produces more accurate results in less time than a grid-based HMM framework using a similar optimization strategy.

QBSE extends the well established query-by-example retrieval paradigm to the semantic domain. While various authors have pointed out the benefits of QBSE, there are still various open questions with respect to this paradigm. These include a lack of precise understanding of how the overall performance depends on various different parameters of the system. In this work, we present a systematic experimental study of the QBSE framework. This can be broadly divided into three categories. First, we examine the space of low-level visual features for its effects on the retrieval performance. Second, we study the space of learned semantic concepts, herein denoted as the ldquosemantic spacerdquo, and show that not all semantic concepts are equally informative for retrieval. Finally, we present a study of the intrinsic structure of the semantic space, by analyzing the contextual relationships between semantic concepts and show that this intrinsic structure is crucial for the performance improvements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563046","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563046.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of query by semantic example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A study of query by semantic example","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563046/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104380","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563046/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of query by semantic example","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058092S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563068,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Holub","affiliation":["Caltech, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Holub","id":"37413296300"},{"name":"Pietro Perona","affiliation":["Caltech, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Perona","id":"37282902900"},{"name":"Michael C.

However, obtaining such data can be a difficult and time-consuming endeavor. We have developed a novel, entropy-based ldquoactive learningrdquo approach which makes significant progress towards this problem. The main idea is to sequentially acquire labeled data by presenting an oracle (the user) with unlabeled images that will be particularly informative when labeled. Active learning adaptively prioritizes the order in which the training examples are acquired, which, as shown by our experiments, can significantly reduce the overall number of training examples required to reach near-optimal performance. At first glance this may seem counter-intuitive: how can the algorithm know whether a group of unlabeled images will be informative, when, by definition, there is no label directly associated with any of the images? Our approach is based on choosing an image to label that maximizes the expected amount of information we gain about the set of unlabeled images. The technique is demonstrated in several contexts, including improving the efficiency of Web image-search queries and open-world visual learning by an autonomous agent. Experiments on a large set of 140 visual object categories taken directly from text-based Web image searches show that our technique can provide large improvements (up to 10 x reduction in the number of training examples needed) over baseline techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563068","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563068.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy-based active learning for object recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Entropy-based active learning for object recognition","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104399","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563068/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy-based active learning for object recognition","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044298S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":4563069,"authors":[{"name":"Peter M.

Since unlabeled training data is often given as an image sequence we propose a tracking-based approach to minimize the manual effort when learning an object detector. The main idea is to apply a tracker within an active on-line learning framework for selecting and labeling unlabeled samples. For that purpose the current classifier is evaluated on a test image and the obtained detection result is verified by the tracker. In this way the most valuable samples can be estimated and used for updating the classifier. Thus, the number of needed samples can be reduced and an incrementally better detector is obtained. To enable efficient learning (i.e., to have real-time performance) and to assure robust tracking results, we apply on-line boosting for both, learning and tracking. If the tracker can be initialized automatically no user interaction is needed and we have an autonomous learning/labeling system. In the experiments the approach is evaluated in detail for learning a face detector. In addition, to show the generality, also results for completely different objects are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563069/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563069/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10117323","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Active sampling via tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active sampling via tracking","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081753S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4563087,"authors":[{"name":"Nico Cornelis","affiliation":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Cornelis","id":"37298475900"},{"name":"Luc Van Gool","affiliation":["K.

Especially when applied to computer vision algorithms where a Single set of Instructions has to be executed on Multiple Data (SIMD), GPU-based algorithms can provide a major increase in processing speed compared to their CPU counterparts. This paper presents methods that take full advantage of modern graphics card hardware for real-time scale invariant feature detection and matching. The focus lies on the extraction of feature locations and the generation of feature descriptors from natural images. The generation of these feature-vectors is based on the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) method [1] due to its high stability against rotation, scale and changes in lighting condition of the processed images. With the presented methods feature detection and matching can be performed at framerates exceeding 100 frames per second for 640 times 480 images. The remaining time can then be spent on fast matching against large feature databases on the GPU while the CPU can be used for other tasks.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563087","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563087.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast scale invariant feature detection and matching on programmable graphics hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast scale invariant feature detection and matching on programmable graphics hardware","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563087/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104226","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563087/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast scale invariant feature detection and matching on programmable graphics hardware","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042025S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4563088,"authors":[{"name":"Yuancheng Luo","affiliation":["Perceptual Interfaces and Reality Laboratory Computer Science & UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"lastName":"Yuancheng Luo","id":"38469486200"},{"name":"Ramani Duraiswami","affiliation":["Perceptual Interfaces and Reality Laboratory Computer Science & UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Ramani","lastName":"Duraiswami","id":"37274487700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2339-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2340-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4563088","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2548},"abstract":"The Canny edge detector is a very popular and effective edge feature detector that is used as a pre-processing step in many computer vision algorithms.

The proposed approach achieves more than 200 frames per second on state-of-the art consumer GPUs for PAL (720 times 576) resolution data, and delivers real-time performance even on low-end mobile graphics processors.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563089","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563089.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast gain-adaptive KLT tracking on the GPU","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563089/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104228","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563089/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast gain-adaptive KLT tracking on the GPU","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058805S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4563092,"authors":[{"name":"Joel Gibson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Gibson","id":"38090817100"},{"name":"Oge Marques","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Oge","lastName":"Marques","id":"37268644900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2339-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2340-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4563092","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Acceleration","Feedback","Computer architecture","Graphics","Taxonomy","Computer science","Yarn","Optimization","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","image matching","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified architecture GPU","Compute Unified Device Architecture","stereo image depth","semiglobal matching algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes how the calculation of depth from stereo images was accelerated using a GPU.

The commodity Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) has emerged as an economical and fast computation co-processor recently. In this paper, we present an implementation of the push-relabel algorithm for graph cuts on the GPU.

For example, let us mention the entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Accurate estimation of these measures requires to adapt to the local sample density, especially if the data are high-dimensional. The k nearest neighbor (kNN) framework has been used to define efficient variable-bandwidth kernel-based estimators with such a locally adaptive property. Unfortunately, these estimators are computationally intensive since they rely on searching neighbors among large sets of d-dimensional vectors. This computational burden can be reduced by pre-structuring the data, e.g. using binary trees as proposed by the approximated nearest neighbor (ANN) library. Yet, the recent opening of graphics processing units (GPU) to general-purpose computation by means of the NVIDIA CUDA API offers the image and video processing community a powerful platform with parallel calculation capabilities. In this paper, we propose a CUDA implementation of the ldquobrute forcerdquo kNN search and we compare its performances to several CPU-based implementations including an equivalent brute force algorithm and ANN. We show a speed increase on synthetic and real data by up to one or two orders of magnitude depending on the data, with a quasi-linear behavior with respect to the data size in a given, practical range.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563100.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast k nearest neighbor search using GPU","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nearest neighbor searches","Information theory","Information retrieval","Image retrieval","Entropy","Density measurement","Binary trees","Libraries","Graphics","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","image retrieval","search problems","statistical analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast k nearest neighbor search","GPU","statistical measures","information theory","image processing","video processing","image retrieval","video object tracking","Kullback-Leibler divergence","efficient variable-bandwidth kernel-based estimators","approximated nearest neighbor library","graphics processing units","NVIDIA CUDA API","brute force algorithm","quasi-linear behavior"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast k nearest neighbor search using GPU","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563100/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104239","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast k nearest neighbor search using GPU","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061284S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4563101,"authors":[{"name":"Yuping Lin","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yuping Lin","id":"37292138300"},{"name":"Gerard Medioni","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"Medioni","id":"37280043300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2339-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2340-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4563101","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Entropy","Retina","Computer science","Image registration","Computer architecture","Workstations","Information theory","Random variables","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image registration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual information computation","maximization","exponential computations","image registration","GPU architecture"]}],"abstract":"We present a GPU implementation to compute both mutual information and its derivatives.

In many approaches proposed for secure biometric storage, an error correcting code (ECC) is applied to the enrollment biometric and the resulting parity or syndrome symbols are stored on the access control device, instead of the original biometric. The principal challenge here is that most standard ECCs are designed for memoryless channel statistics, whereas the variations between enrollment and probe biometrics have significant spatial correlation. To address this challenge, we propose to transform the original biometric into a feature vector that is explicitly matched to standard ECCs, thereby improving the security-robustness tradeoff of the overall biometric system. As a concrete example, we transform fingerprint minutiae maps into feature vectors compatible with ECCs designed for a binary symmetric channel. We conduct a statistical analysis of these feature vectors and show how our feature transformation algorithm may be combined with Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes to obtain a secure fingerprint biometric system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104248","htmlLink":"/document/4563111/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Feature transformation of biometric templates for secure biometric systems based on error correcting codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature transformation of biometric templates for secure biometric systems based on error correcting codes","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036629S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563115,"authors":[{"name":"K.

While tremendous progress has been made in the field of automatic fingerprint matching, latent fingerprint matching continues to be a difficult problem because the challenges involved in latent print matching are quite different from plain or rolled fingerprint matching. Poor quality of friction ridge impressions, small finger area and large non-linear distortion are some of the main difficulties in latent fingerprint matching. We propose a system for matching latent images to rolled fingerprints that takes into account the specific characteristics of the latent matching problem. In addition to minutiae, additional features like orientation field and quality map are also used in our system. Experimental results on the NIST SD27 latent database indicate that the introduction of orientation field and quality map to minutiae-based matching leads to good recognition performance despite the inherently difficult nature of the problem. We achieve the rank-20 accuracy of 93.4% in retrieving 258 latents from a background database of 2,258 rolled fingerprints.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563117","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563117.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On matching latent fingerprints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"On matching latent fingerprints","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563117/","accessionNumber":"10104254","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563117/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On matching latent fingerprints","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043516S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":4563144,"authors":[{"name":"Bahador Khaleghi","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Sensing Systems Laboratory E.C.E.

This is a significant improvement over the original MESVS-I system in terms of performance, quality and accuracy of results. MESVS-II running at 600MHz per core, is capable of operating at up to 20 fps, which is twice as fast as MESVS-I, due to the efficient implementation of stereo-vision algorithms, improved memory and data management, in-place processing scheme, code optimization, and the pipelined-programming model that takes advantage of the dual-core architecture of the embedded processor. The firmware incorporates sub-sampling, rectification, pre-processing, matching, LRC (Left/Right Consistency) check and post-processing. As demonstrated by our experimental results, we have also enhanced the robustness of the stereo-matching engine to radiometric variations by choosing census transform over rank transform.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563144","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563144.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved real-time miniaturized embedded stereo vision system (MESVS-II)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563144/","displayDocTitle":"An improved real-time miniaturized embedded stereo vision system (MESVS-II)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10090884","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563144/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved real-time miniaturized embedded stereo vision system (MESVS-II)","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050042S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4563146,"authors":[{"name":"Kristian Ambrosch","affiliation":["Austrian Research Centers Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung ARC, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Kristian","lastName":"Ambrosch","id":"37601468400"},{"name":"Martin Humenberger","affiliation":["Austrian Research Centers Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung ARC, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Humenberger","id":"37393549200"},{"name":"Wilfried Kubinger","affiliation":["Austrian Research Centers Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung ARC, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Kubinger","id":"37393547500"},{"name":"Andreas Steininger","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Steininger","id":"37284661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2339-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2340-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4563146","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":172},"abstract":"Stereo vision has become a very interesting sensing technology for robotic platforms. It offers various advantages, but the drawback is a very high algorithmic effort. Due to the aptitude of certain non-parametric techniques for field programmable gate array (FPGA) based stereo matching, these algorithms can be implemented in highly parallel design while offering adequate real-time behavior. To enable the provision of color images by the stereo sensor for object classification tasks, we propose a technique for extending the rank and the census transform for increased robustness on gray scaled Bayer patterned images. Furthermore, we analyze the extended and the original algorithmspsila behavior on image sets created in controlled environments as well as on real world images and compare their resource usage when implemented on our FPGA based stereo matching architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563146.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending two non-parametric transforms for FPGA based stereo matching using bayer filtered cameras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Matched filters","Cameras","Robot vision systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Stereo vision","Robot sensing systems","Color","Image sensors","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image matching","image sensors","robot vision","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonparametric transforms","FPGA","stereo matching","Bayer filtered cameras","stereo vision","robotic platforms","field programmable gate array","object classification tasks","gray scaled Bayer patterned images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Extending two non-parametric transforms for FPGA based stereo matching using bayer filtered cameras","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563146/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104278","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending two non-parametric transforms for FPGA based stereo matching using bayer filtered cameras","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056734S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563158,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Huhle","affiliation":["WSI GRIS, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Huhle","id":"37321498600"},{"name":"Timo Schairer","affiliation":["WSI GRIS, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Schairer","id":"37321500000"},{"name":"Philipp Jenke","affiliation":["WSI GRIS, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Jenke","id":"37946782400"},{"name":"Wolfgang Strasser","affiliation":["Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Strasser","id":"37356207300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2339-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2340-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4563158","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":686},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust non-local denoising of colored depth data","abstract":"We give a brief discussion of denoising algorithms for depth data and introduce a novel technique based on the NL-Means Filter.

In this paper we present a study concerning the use of the Canesta TOF camera for recognition of curbs and ramps. Our approach is based on the detection of individual planar patches using CC-RANSAC, a modified version of the classic RANSAC robust regression algorithm. Whereas RANSAC uses the whole set of inliers to evaluate the fitness of a candidate plane, CC-RANSAC only considers the largest connected components of inliers. We provide experimental evidence that CC-RANSAC provides a more accurate estimation of the dominant plane than RANSAC with a smaller number of iterations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Cameras","Vehicles","Ultrasonic imaging","Image sensors","Sensor systems","Layout","Object detection","Sensor arrays","Microwave sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","object detection","road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust curb detection","robust ramp detection","safe parking","Canesta TOF camera","TOF imaging range sensors","CC-RANSAC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563165","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563165.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust curb and ramp detection for safe parking using the Canesta TOF camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust curb and ramp detection for safe parking using the Canesta TOF camera","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563165/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563165/","accessionNumber":"10104293","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust curb and ramp detection for safe parking using the Canesta TOF camera","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07072008-00217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074354S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558053","isNumber":"4562948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558053","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4562948","articleId":"4563165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4563171,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Schuon","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Schuon","id":"37542331200"},{"name":"Christian Theobalt","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Theobalt","id":"37266878500"},{"name":"James Davis","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Davis","id":"38183303700"},{"name":"Sebastian Thrun","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Thrun","id":"37280207800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2339-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2340-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4563171","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":18,"totalDownloads":1222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal resolution","Cameras","Image resolution","Colored noise","Layout","Color","Robustness","Statistics","Pulse measurements","Pulse modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image resolution","image sampling","image scanners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-quality 3D scanning","time-of-flight depth superresolution","time-of-flight camera","video frame rate","color image superresolution","X-Y resolution","depth upsampling method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563171","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4562948","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558053/4562948/04563171.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-quality scanning using time-of-flight depth superresolution","abstract":"Time-of-flight (TOF) cameras robustly provide depth data of real world scenes at video frame rates.

We consider finite-length codes decoded by belief propagation (BP) and a well-known approximation of it, referred to as min-sum (MS), over a binary input additive white Gaussian noise (BIAWGN) channel. For both algorithms, we show that the application of SR in different domains results in different error correcting performance. In particular, the performances of SR in log-likelihood ratio (LLR) and LR domains for BP and MS are compared, and it is shown that SR-MS-LLR has the best performance. For the tested codes, SR-MS-LLR outperforms standard BP by up to about 0.5 dB, offering an attractive solution in terms of performance/complexity tradeoff. We also investigate the effects of quantization on SR-MS-LLR and demonstrate that at least 6-7 bits of quantization is required to capture close to floating-point performance.","doi":"10.1109/BSC.2008.4563216","publicationTitle":"2008 24th Biennial Symposium on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 24th Biennial Symposium on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557991/4563185/04563216.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSC.2008.4563216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive relaxation for decoding of LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563216/","displayDocTitle":"Successive relaxation for decoding of LDPC codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104077","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563216/","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive relaxation for decoding of LDPC codes","confLoc":"Kingston, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07082008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03786S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4557991","isNumber":"4563185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557991","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4563185","articleId":"4563216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563219,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhiyong He","id":"37404107800"},{"name":"Roy Sebastien","affiliation":["Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, CA"],"firstName":"Roy","lastName":"Sebastien"},{"name":"Paul Fortier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Fortier","id":"37271550500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1945-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1946-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4563219","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563219","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","MIMO","Transceivers","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Data communication","Wireless networks","Decoding","Cellular phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","antenna arrays","channel capacity","decoding","diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiplexing","parity check codes","Rayleigh channels","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive LDPC codes","MIMO transceiver","adaptive spectral efficiency","multirate low density parity check code","multiple-input multiple-output transceiver","wireless networks","channel capacity","multiple transmit antennae","multiple receiver antennae","space-time diversity technique","space-time multiplexing technique","subscriber station","Rayleigh fading channel","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"By using a multi-rate low density parity check (LDPC) code, we propose an LDPC coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver with adaptive spectral efficiency which allows data transmission in wireless networks at rates near the channel capacity with arbitrarily low probability of error.

The proposed algorithm decreases the overall block error rate (i.e. the probability to have at least one error at the demodulated transmit vector) when QR-SIC detection scheme is used for detection of transmit symbols.

Traditionally, transmitter designs for this system have been based on constraints of either the transmission power or the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for each user. Here, we explore a novel perspective and examine a transceiver design which is based on a fixed sum mutual information constraint and minimizes the arithmetic average of mean square error of MMSE-decision feedback detection. For this optimization problem, a closed-form solution is obtained and is achieved if and only if the averaged sum mutual information is uniformly distributed over each active subchannel. Meanwhile, the mutual information of the currently detected user is uniformly distributed over each individual symbol within the block signal of the user, assuming all the previous user signals have been perfectly detected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563222/","accessionNumber":"10104083","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver pair designs for multiple access channels under fixed sum mutual information using mmse decision feedback detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transceiver pair designs for multiple access channels under fixed sum mutual information using mmse decision feedback detection","confLoc":"Kingston, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07082008-00037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085049S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4557991","isNumber":"4563185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557991","xplore-issue":"4563185","articleId":"4563222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4563223,"authors":[{"name":"Tingting Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Tingting Liu","id":"37697042200"},{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Jian-Kang Zhang","id":"37281463700"},{"name":"Kon Max Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Kon Max Wong","id":"37278682400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1945-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1946-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4563223","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","MIMO","Communication systems","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","State feedback","Channel state information","Wireless communication","Fading","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","concave programming","fading channels","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmitter","MIMO systems","multi-input multi-output communication systems","decision feedback receivers","zero-forcing decision feedback receivers","ZF-DF","channel state information","CSI","wireless communication systems","CSI feedback","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","flat fading channel","statistical analysis","average arithmetic mean square error","MSE","majorization theory","nonconvex optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"The design of optimum transmission precoder for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication systems equipped with zero-forcing decision feedback (ZF-DF) receivers usually requires perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and the receiver. In wireless communication systems, however, it is often difficult to provide sufficiently timely and accurate CSI feedback from the receiver to the transmitter for such designs to be practically viable. In this paper, we consider the transmission precoder design for a MIMO communication system having M transmitter antennas and N receiver antennas (M < N) in a wireless link in which the channels are assumed to be flat fading and possibly correlated. We assume that full CSI is known at the receiver, but only the first- and second-order statistics of the channels are available at the transmitter. The goal in this paper is to seek an efficient design of the optimal precoder for such a MIMO system by minimizing the total transmitting power of the ZF-DF receiver subject to a constraint on the average arithmetic mean square error (MSE). Utilizing majorization theory, we transform this non-convex optimization problem into a convex geometrical programming problem, which can then be efficiently solved using an interior point method. In the case of the MIMO random channel being uncorrelated, a closed-form solution to the optimization problem has also been obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient design of optimal transmitter for MIMO systems using decision feedback receivers","publicationTitle":"2008 24th Biennial Symposium on Communications","doi":"10.1109/BSC.2008.4563223","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 24th Biennial Symposium on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557991/4563185/04563223.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSC.2008.4563223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient design of optimal transmitter for MIMO systems using decision feedback receivers","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563223/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10104084","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient design of optimal transmitter for MIMO systems using decision feedback receivers","confLoc":"Kingston, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07082008-00038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077734S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4557991","isNumber":"4563185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557991","xplore-issue":"4563185","articleId":"4563223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563225,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Xu","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, Marseilles, France"],"lastName":"Fang Xu","id":"37401236800"},{"name":"Mohammad-Ali Khalighi","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Mohammad-Ali","lastName":"Khalighi","id":"37294707300"},{"name":"Patrice Causse","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Patrice","lastName":"Causse","id":"38094590100"},{"name":"Salah Bourennane","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Salah","lastName":"Bourennane","id":"37285089400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1945-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1946-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4563225","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563225","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Delay","Channel coding","Convolutional codes","Optical receivers","Optical refraction","Optical transmitters","Atmospheric modeling","Decoding","Intensity modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","channel coding","channel estimation","convolutional codes","decoding","interleaved codes","optical links","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded time-diversity free-space optical links","tolerable delay latency","channel coding","interleave code","turbo-codes","atmospheric turbulence condition","convolutional code","decoding complexity","channel estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BSC.2008.4563225","endPage":"149","startPage":"146","publicationTitle":"2008 24th Biennial Symposium on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 24th Biennial Symposium on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557991/4563185/04563225.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSC.2008.4563225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of coded time-diversity free-space optical links","abstract":"Depending on the tolerable delay latency, we can benefit from some degree of time diversity in free-space optical links, by employing channel coding and interleaving.

For example, at a rate of 200 fps, a four-level quantizer gives approximately a two-fold increase in capacity over a binary-level quantizer for all frame sizes considered. The second technique uses higher order noise shaping to shape the quantization noise to the out-of-band spatial frequency spectrum, and hence improves capacity.

A code is proposed which increases the rate of so-called noncoherent orthogonal designs by taking a union of permuted noncoherent orthogonal codebooks. For symbols taken from a QPSK constellation, the permuted noncoherent orthogonal codebooks have a strong group structure. This structure can be exploited, using coding, to construct codebooks such that the minimum pairwise codeword distance is no less than that of a noncoherent orthogonal codebook. Furthermore, the codewords of the permuted noncoherent orthogonal codebook maintain the orthogonal structure of the original codebooks so that simple detection is still possible at the receiver. This approach results in an increased data rate without sacrificing the minimum distance. Simulation results are provided for a rate 1.25 bit per channel use (bpcu) permuted noncoherent orthogonal design.

In this paper, the problem of designing training signals is investigated for correlated and uncorrelated multi-input multioutput (MIMO) channels. For this, the optimum channel estimation is briefly addressed in the sense of mean square error. Then the optimum training signal is designed for correlated and uncorrelated channels by maximizing the mutual information (carried by training signal) between the channel and the received sequence during the training. Simulations show that employing the optimal training provides improvement as compared with employing the orthogonal training. This improvement is more significant at low SNR and for correlated channels.

The obtained results indicate that to obtain the correct optimum power allocation strategy antenna mutual coupling effects need to be properly taken into consideration. This claim is supported by computer simulation examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4446029/04563288.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2008.928474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2008.928474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing MIMO Channel Capacities Under the Influence of Antenna Mutual Coupling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Mutual coupling","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Impedance","Voltage","Antenna arrays","Computer simulation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","impedance matching","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO","channel capacity","antenna mutual coupling","transmitting mutual impedance","receiving mutual impedance","multiple-input multiple-output system","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","mutual coupling (MC)","receiving mutual impedance","signal correlation"]},{"kwd":["MIMO","channel capacity","signal correlation","mutual coupling","receiving mutual impedance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing MIMO Channel Capacities Under the Influence of Antenna Mutual Coupling","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4563288/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10251066","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing MIMO Channel Capacities Under the Influence of Antenna Mutual Coupling","sourcePdf":"07lawp01-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064199S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4446029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4446029","articleId":"4563288","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563290,"authors":[{"name":"Sanming Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Positioning and Wireless Technology Centre, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sanming","lastName":"Hu","id":"37290176300"},{"name":"Choi Look Law","affiliation":["Positioning and Wireless Technology Centre, Nanyang University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Choi Look","lastName":"Law","id":"37279807600"},{"name":"Wenbin Dou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Dou","id":"37302164500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4563290","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1295},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar scattering","Ultra wideband antennas","Ultra wideband technology","Antenna theory","Radar cross section","Loaded antennas","Radar antennas","Antenna measurements","Radio frequency","Radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balloons","monopole antennas","radar cross-sections","radiofrequency identification","scattering","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balloon-shaped monopole antenna","passive UWB-RFID tag applications","balloon-shaped ultrawideband antenna","radar cross-section","omnidirectional scattering pattern","radio-frequency identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backscattering","radar cross-section (RCS)","radio-frequency identification (RFID)","structural and antenna modes","ultrawideband (UWB) antennas"]},{"kwd":["Backscattering","radar cross-section (RCS)","radio-frequency identification (RFID)","structural and antenna modes","ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas"]}],"abstract":"A balloon-shaped ultrawideband (UWB) antenna is developed, and its scattering characteristics are theoretically and experimentally studied in both the frequency and time domain.

The results which are in good agreement show that, the balloon-shaped antenna is with almost omnidirectional scattering pattern, and its scattering of antenna mode and structural mode are obviously separated in the time domain. Therefore, this antenna is an eligible candidate for the passive ultrawideband-enabled radio-frequency identification (UWB-RFID) tag applications.

CDMA systems have been highly successful due to the huge increase in capacity offered compared to other technologies. An effective technique to further increase the capacity of time-varying wireless channels is the employment of adaptive rate transmissions. Here, the transmission rate, bandwidth and power can be adaptively adjusted depending upon the instantaneous channel conditions. In this project, we analyzed the rate identification technique in such multirate systems. We saw how the concept of using the same PN sequence can significantly simplify the system.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2007.4563298","publicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547418/4563292/04563298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2007.4563298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563292","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate identification in multirate CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate identification in multirate CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563298/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10060518","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563298/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate identification in multirate CDMA","confLoc":"Pomona, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-06262008-00006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033949S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4547418","isNumber":"4563292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547418","xplore-issue":"4563292","articleId":"4563298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4563300,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In a UWB-OFDM transceiver, resource efficient FFT/IFFT hardware is a necessity due to minimal silicon area and low power requirements. Resource requirements can be reduced by using finite precision arithmetic in the FFT/IFFT algorithms. However, this introduces round-off and overflow noise, resulting in a degradation in BER performance. To address this problem, the finite precision arithmetic and wordlengths should be optimally designed at every stage of the FFT/IFFT. In this paper, we first present a mixed-radix FFT/IFFT algorithm for a UWB-OFDM transceiver with low multiplicative complexity. A round-off noise propagation model is derived and used to determine the optimal wordlength of the outputs and twiddle factors at each stage. The performance of the resulting system is compared to that with infinite precision arithmetic.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2007.4563300","publicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547418/4563292/04563300.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2007.4563300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563292","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite wordlength design for FFT/IFFT in UWB-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite wordlength design for FFT/IFFT in UWB-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563300/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10060519","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563300/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite wordlength design for FFT/IFFT in UWB-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Pomona, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-06262008-00008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061992S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4547418","isNumber":"4563292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547418","xplore-issue":"4563292","articleId":"4563300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563303,"authors":[{"name":"Yair Linn","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yair","lastName":"Linn","id":"37272617500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0696-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0697-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"4563303","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":221},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient loop filter design in FPGAs for Phase Lock Loops in high-datarate wireless receivers \u2014 theory and case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563303","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering theory","Field programmable gate arrays","Phase locked loops","Digital filters","Phase detection","Frequency","Clocks","Detectors","Timing","Fixed-point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network synthesis","phase locked loops","programmable filters","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loop filter design","FPGA","phase lock loops","high-datarate wireless receivers","field programmable gate arrays","fixed-point arithmetic","PLL"]}],"abstract":"In most contemporary phase lock loops (PLLs) used in high-datarate wireless receivers, some or all of the PLL 's components are implemented digitally, in particular the PLL's loop filter.

Traditionally, the M-ary QAM demodulator employs the maximum likelihood algorithm as the decision rule. It assumes equally likely message symbols. Accordingly, a maximum likelihood decoder computes the log-likelihood functions as metrics for all possible M message symbols, compares them, and then decides in favor of the maximum. When M is larger, the number of multiplications, additions, subtractions, and comparisons are significantly increased. As opposed to decode the received symbol, a new bit level decoding scheme is proposed based on the signal constellation. This bit decoding scheme is significantly simpler and faster than the conventional method. Simulation results show it presents the same bit error rate (BER) performance as the conventional method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547418/4563292/04563318.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2007.4563318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2007.4563318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity demodulator for M-ary QAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bit error rate","Maximum likelihood decoding","Constellation diagram","AWGN","Fading","Local area networks","Maximum likelihood detection","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity demodulator","M-ary QAM","quadrature amplitude modulation","maximum likelihood algorithm","decision rule","maximum likelihood decoder","log-likelihood functions","M message symbols","bit level decoding scheme","signal constellation","bit error rate","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity demodulator for M-ary QAM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10067193","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity demodulator for M-ary QAM","confLoc":"Pomona, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-06262008-00026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048441S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4547418","isNumber":"4563292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547418","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4563292","articleId":"4563318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563323,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Yu-Ju","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan, China"],"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"Yu-Ju","id":"37087740971"},{"name":"Ming-Shi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng-Kung University, Taiwan ROC"],"firstName":"Ming-Shi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311180200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0696-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0697-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"4563323","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563323","abstract":"In this paper the competitive Hopfield neural network method for finding a broadcasting schedule in the satellite system will be described. The satellite broadcast scheduling (SBS) problem is known as an NP-complete problem. Communication links between satellites and ground terminals are provided in a repetition of time slots. The goal of the proposed algorithm is to find the broadcasting schedule of satellites with the maximum number of broadcasting time slots under the constraints. A competitive learning rule provides a highly effective means for obtaining a resonance solution and is capable of reducing the time-consuming effort to obtain coefficients. The proposed method can always satisfy the problem constraints and guarantee the viability of the solutions for the SBS problem. The competitive mechanism simplifies the network complexity. The proposed method is greatly suitable for implementation on a digital machine. Furthermore, the competitive Hopfield neural network method permits temporary energy increases to escape from local minima. Simulation results show that the competitive Hopfield neural network method can improve system performance and with fast convergence and high reliability.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2007.4563323","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547418/4563292/04563323.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2007.4563323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing satellite broadcast scheduling problem using the competitive Hopfield neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","Hopfield neural networks","Neural networks","Artificial satellites","Neurons","Image segmentation","Optimization methods","Artificial neural networks","Annealing","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct broadcasting by satellite","Hopfield neural nets","radio links","scheduling","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite broadcast scheduling problem optimization","competitive Hopfield neural network","NP-complete problem","communication links","broadcasting time slots","competitive learning rule","resonance solution","time-consuming effort","network complexity","digital machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing satellite broadcast scheduling problem using the competitive Hopfield neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563323/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","accessionNumber":"10060524","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing satellite broadcast scheduling problem using the competitive Hopfield neural network","confLoc":"Pomona, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-06262008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049658S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4547418","isNumber":"4563292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547418","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4563292","articleId":"4563323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4563325,"authors":[{"name":"Roger M.

A network design constitutes base station location and infrastructure configuration. It is convention to evaluate network designs using a range of traffic snapshots, each representing a different static geographical distribution of users with particular requests for heterogeneous services. However service coverage evaluation in WCDMA systems is non-trivial because per-link power allocations are required in response to interference from the power allocated to other users. We investigate the sensitivity of two fundamental variables associated with snapshot evaluation-priorities for admission and the mix of requested services. This is carried out in detail for the downlink scenario using a highly efficient offline evaluation technique that avoids recourse to lengthy simulation of online system power control. The results expose the significant influence that the variables have on the resultant evaluation of a candidate network design using a single traffic snapshot. This is important knowledge for network planning.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547418/4563292/04563325.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2007.4563325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2007.4563325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity of service coverage evaluation for WCDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Resource management","Base stations","Telecommunication traffic","Interference","Downlink","Power control","Communication system traffic control","Traffic control","Power system planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service coverage evaluation","WCDMA systems","wideband code division multiple access","third generation WCDMA network design","user service coverage","resource utilisation","base station location","infrastructure configuration","traffic snapshots","static geographical distribution","heterogeneous services","per-link power allocations","snapshot evaluation","offline evaluation technique","online system power control","network planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity of service coverage evaluation for WCDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563325/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10067196","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity of service coverage evaluation for WCDMA systems","confLoc":"Pomona, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-06262008-00033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057627S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4547418","isNumber":"4563292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547418","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4563292","articleId":"4563325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4563327,"authors":[{"name":"Luo Jun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, USA"],"firstName":"Luo","lastName":"Jun","id":"37087739802"},{"name":"Jean H.

Most of the CDMA systems today and in the near future will continue to use the conventional matched filter with its comparatively low user capacity and a slow data rate. However, if we could lower the computational complexity of multiuser detectors, most of the CDMA systems would be likely to take advantage of this technique in order to gain increased system capacity and a better data rate. In this paper, a novel approach for reducing the computational complexity of multiuser receivers is proposed. It utilizes the transformation matrix technique to improve the performance of multiuser detectors. We show that the mathematical computations of the implementation complexity can turn in overall less complex system that has strong impact on the system's signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the bit error rate (BER). The performance measure adopted in this paper is the achievable bit rate for a fixed probability of error (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-7</sup>\n) and consistent values of SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547418/4563292/04563331.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2007.4563331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2007.4563331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformation matrix algorithm for reducing the computational complexity of multiuser receivers for DS-CDMA wireless systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational complexity","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Multiuser detection","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Multiple access interference","Computer science","Matched filters","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","computational complexity","error statistics","matched filters","mathematical analysis","matrix algebra","multiuser detection","radiocommunication","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformation matrix algorithm","computational complexity","multiuser receivers","DS-CDMA wireless systems","multiuser detection","conventional matched filter","system capacity","mathematical computations","signal to noise ratio","bit error rate","fixed probability error","direct-sequence code division multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Transformation matrix algorithm for reducing the computational complexity of multiuser receivers for DS-CDMA wireless systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563331/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10067200","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformation matrix algorithm for reducing the computational complexity of multiuser receivers for DS-CDMA wireless systems","confLoc":"Pomona, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-06262008-00039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090662S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4547418","isNumber":"4563292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547418","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4563292","articleId":"4563331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563334,"authors":[{"name":"Farooq Bari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Farooq","lastName":"Bari","id":"37297175300"},{"name":"Victor C.

With anticipated proliferation of multimode IP devices, the optimal selection of a service delivery network among multiple IP based wireless access alternatives is one of the important issues that is actively studied and discussed in several standardization forums. Use of multi attribute decision making (MADM) algorithms has been proposed in the past for network selection decisions in a heterogeneous wireless network environment. A direct comparison of these algorithms is difficult as this would require the use of another MADM algorithm. A better approach instead is to ascertain the appropriateness of the algorithm to the problem space. This paper provides the basis for evaluating the appropriateness of MADM algorithms for network selection. It analyzes the use of MADM algorithms such as TOPSIS, ELECTRE and GRA for network selection and argues that GRA provides the best approach in scenarios where the utilities of some of the attributes are non-monotonic. The paper proposes a novel stepwise approach for GRA that uses multiple reference networks and explains its working with network selection scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547418/4563292/04563334.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2007.4563334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2007.4563334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of non-monotonic utility in multi-attribute network selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision making","Standardization","Protocols","Availability","Wireless networks","Quality of service","Computer networks","IP networks","Degradation","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","IP networks","radio networks","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonmonotonic utility","multiattribute network selection","network convergence","ubiquitous service availability","multimode IP device proliferation","multiple IP based wireless access alternatives","multiattribute decision making algorithms","network selection decisions","heterogeneous wireless network environment","multiple reference networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Use of non-monotonic utility in multi-attribute network selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563334/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10103171","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of non-monotonic utility in multi-attribute network selection","confLoc":"Pomona, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-06262008-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058055S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4547418","isNumber":"4563292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547418","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4563292","articleId":"4563334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563340,"authors":[{"name":"Fulu Li","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Fulu","lastName":"Li","id":"37289387700"},{"name":"Ivan Vukovic","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Vukovic","id":"37268390300"},{"name":"Andrew Lippman","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lippman","id":"37317407200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0696-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0697-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"4563340","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"abstract":"Voice traffic is not efficiently supported by CDMA EVDO Rev. A from its original design, but an efficient approach is needed to support voice traffic over CDMA EVDO Rev. A for graceful migration from CDMA2000 1x to CDMA EVDO Rev.

To understand the system design tradeoffs, we first investigate the traffic characteristics of EVRC-encoded real voice traces and we find that the correlation structure of voice traffic exhibits strong long-range dependence. We further observe that the burst length distribution of voice traffic is heavy-tailed. Traditional Markov-model could not accurately characterize the true nature of the voice traffic. In the major part of our study, we examine the tradeoff between the initial play out delay and voice quality for real voice traces over CDMA EVDO Rev. A. We also examine the tradeoff between voice quality and RF conditions, e.g., the location of mobiles and the number of mobiles in a sector, etc. Finally, we address the performance aspects of voice traffic over CDMA EVDO Rev.

Therefore it is vitally important for us to understand the radio propagation characteristics, especially the Path Loss of these specific environments prior to the deployment of a WSN. The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) technique using the Yee algorithm [1] is well-known for its ability to produce accurate predictions of received signal levels. However, when facing the challenges of large-scale systems e.g., nodes located in fire hydrants, tunnels, etc, the computational requirements of this technique become overwhelming, particularly for 3D simulations. In this paper, based on comparisons between conventional 2D FDTD simulations and existing analytical models of Free Space Path Loss and Plane Earth Path Loss, we propose a Modified 2D FDTD method. A unique path loss correction factor is determined. It converts a 3D signal source into an equivalent 2D source and provides path loss results which are identical to those of a full 3D model in both free space and plane earth scenarios.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20080230","publicationTitle":"2008 IET 7th International Conference on Computation in Electromagnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IET 7th International Conference on Computation in Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4550751/4563346/04563384.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20080230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path loss estimation in 3D environments using a modified 2D Finite-Difference Time-Domain technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563384/","displayDocTitle":"Path loss estimation in 3D environments using a modified 2D Finite-Difference Time-Domain technique","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10197316","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path loss estimation in 3D environments using a modified 2D Finite-Difference Time-Domain technique","confLoc":"Brighton","sourcePdf":"SPI-07042008-00038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051294S","chronDate":"7-10 April 2008","isNumber":"4563346","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4550751","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4563384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563425,"authors":[{"name":"Juan F.

When the estimator is fixed and known, the estimation performance before and after the addition of noise are evaluated. Performance comparisons are made between the original estimators and noise enhanced estimators based on different criteria. The form of the optimal noise probability density function (pdf) is determined. The results are further extended to the general case where the noise is introduced to the system via a transformation. For the case where the estimator is fixed and unknown, approaches are also proposed to find the optimum noise. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented where the performance comparison is made between the optimal noise modified estimator and Gaussian noise modified estimator.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Signal processing","Quantization","Nonlinear systems","Detectors","Frequency estimation","Gaussian noise","Stochastic resonance","Signal to noise ratio","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Gaussian noise","parameter estimation","signal denoising","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise enhanced parameter estimation","noise enhanced systems","probability density function","Gaussian noise modified estimator","optimal noise modified estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian estimation","noise enhanced estimation","parameter estimation","stochastic resonance"]},{"kwd":["Parameter Estimation","Stochastic Resonance","Noise Enhanced Estimation","Bayesian Estimation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928508","startPage":"5074","endPage":"5081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4626086/04563429.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Enhanced Parameter Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noise Enhanced Parameter Estimation","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10208453","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","volume":"56","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4563429/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Enhanced Parameter Estimation","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-chen-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076107S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4563429","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4563430,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4626086/4563430/4563430-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Chen (M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, in 1999, 2002, 2007, respectively.","Since 2007, he has been a Research Associate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Syracuse University.

This paper analyzes the stochastic resonance (SR) effect under the condition that the detector structure or its parameters can also be changed. The detector optimization problem with SR noise under both Neyman-Pearson and Bayesian criteria is examined. In the Bayesian approach when the prior probabilities are unknown, the minimax approach is adopted. The form of the optimal noise pdf along with the corresponding detector as well as the maximum achievable performance are determined. The developed theory is then applied to a general class of weak signal detection problems. Under the assumptions that the sample size \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n is large enough and the test statistics satisfies the conditions of central limit theorem, the optimal SR noise is shown to be a constant vector and independent of the signal strength for both Neyman-Pearson and Bayesian criteria.

Besides, GPR can be understood as a nonlinear minimum mean square error estimator, a standard criterion for training equalizers that trades off the inversion of the channel and the amplification of the noise. In the experiment section, we show that the GPR-based equalizer clearly outperforms support vector machine and kernel adaline approaches, exhibiting outstanding results for short training sequences.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4626086/04563433.pdf","startPage":"5283","endPage":"5286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Channel Equalization With Gaussian Processes for Regression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian processes","Ground penetrating radar","Equalizers","Digital communication","Kernel","Maximum likelihood estimation","Support vector machines","Nonlinear distortion","Delay estimation","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear channel equalization","Gaussian processes","digital communications receivers","maximum likelihood estimation","nonlinear minimum mean square error estimator","short training sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equalization","Gaussian processes","kernel adaline","nonlinear equalization","regression","support vector machines"]},{"kwd":["Gaussian Processes","Regression","Equalization","Nonlinear Equalization","Kernel Adaline","Support Vector Machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Channel Equalization With Gaussian Processes for Regression","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4563433/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10208456","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Channel Equalization With Gaussian Processes for Regression","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-perezcruz-cr-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04834S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4563433","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4563434,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00d6tz E.

Reed (SM'69\u2013F'73\u2013LF'07) was born on November 12, 1923 in Seattle, WA. He attended the University of Alaska for two years and received the B.S. degree and Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 1944 and 1949, respectively.","In 1949, following two years of service in the U.S. Navy he began his career as a Research Engineer at the Northrop Corporation, where he contributed to the development of the magnetic drum digital differential analyzer (MADDIDA) computer. In 1950, he was part of the four-man Northrop team which demonstrated the revolutionary capabilities of MADDIDA to John von Neumann at Princeton, who termed their''field demonstration\" one of the most impressive engineering feats he had observed in the field. In 1951, he joined MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. As a staff member and later as an associate group leader, he made further primary contributions to the development of digital computers, culminating in the modern register transfer language (RTL) method of design and the first textbook to utilize the RTL design method to realize digital computer architectures. In 1960, he moved to the Rand Corporation as Senior Staff Member and in 1963 joined the faculty of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, where he was later appointed Charles Lee Powell Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the position he holds today. Perhaps his best known contribution is in the area of error-correcting codes. The principal originator of the Reed\u2013Muller (1954) and Reed\u2013Solomon (1960) codes, he anticipated the central concepts of the modern field of algebraic coding theory. The significant impacts of his research effort in this field range from space communications to the compact disc and digital television. Also his interest and contributions in detection theory as applied to radar and optics, continue to the present time. His recent contributions are to detection theory as applied to radar and optics, adaptive arrays, digital signal processing, and VLSI design of coders and decoders. He has authored and coauthored over 300 publications and is the holder of six U.S. patents. He has been a founding member of four California corporations: Computer Research Corporation (1950) (now the computer division of National Cash Register Corporation); Technology Service Corporation (1967), where he was Director and Scientific Advisor; Adaptive Sensors Corporation (1980); and Space Computer Corporation (1990).

We establish very general equivalences between conjugate direction and multistage Wiener filters, wherein the direction vectors of a conjugate direction filter and the stagewise vectors of a multistage filter are related through a one-term autoregressive recursion.

As a consequence, their subspace filters, gradients, and MSEs are identical at each stage of the subspace iteration. If the conjugate direction filter is a conjugate gradient filter, then the equivalent stagewise filter is an orthogonal multistage filter, and vice-versa. If either the conjugate gradient filter or the orthogonal multistage filter is initialized at the cross-covariance vector between the signal and the measurement, then each of the subspace filters iteratively turns out a basis for a Krylov subspace.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928511","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4626086/04563435.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"5013","endPage":"5019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace Expansion and the Equivalence of Conjugate Direction and Multistage Wiener Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Subspace Expansion and the Equivalence of Conjugate Direction and Multistage Wiener Filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563435/","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4563435/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235313","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace Expansion and the Equivalence of Conjugate Direction and Multistage Wiener Filters","sourcePdf":"56tsp10-scharf-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064816S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4626086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4626086","articleId":"4563435","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4563436,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Y.

The proposed method uses a global optimization procedure to maximize the compressed likelihood function, which is a function of only the DOAs. The procedure is based on Monte Carlo importance sampling. It is shown via simulations that the method allows for estimation of DOAs at low angular separation and in situations for which other suboptimal techniques may fail. The improved performance of this method is due to its guaranteed convergence to a global maximum, which is not true for the iterative ML methods, as, for example, the WSF, MODE(X), and EM algorithms.

Novel infinite series expressions for the joint probability density function and moments are derived for the general case where the associated bivariate distributions, i.e., Rayleigh and gamma, are both arbitrary correlated. These expressions generalize previously known analytical results obtained for identical parameter cases. Furthermore, considering independent gamma distributions, the cumulative distribution and characteristic functions are analytically obtained. Although the derived expressions can be used in a wide range of applications, this letter focuses on the performance analysis of dual branch diversity receivers. Specifically, the outage performance of dual selection diversity receivers operating over correlated K fading/shadowing channels is analytically evaluated. Moreover, for low normalized outage threshold values, closed-form expressions are obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563460/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10437308","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Correlated <formula> <tex>$K$</tex> </formula>-Distribution With Arbitrary Fading Parameters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Correlated <formula> <tex>$K$</tex> </formula>-Distribution With Arbitrary Fading Parameters","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-bithas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132262S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4563460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4563461,"authors":[{"name":"Eun H.

The proposed technique achieves nearly the capacity of optimal waterfill power loading, while significantly reducing feedback by using order information for the subcarrier channel gains. Furthermore, the proposed power loading technique can circumvent the practical shortcomings of previous limited feedback power loading techniques by simply exploiting order mapping and interpolation. The advantages are particularly visible at low SNR or for many subcarriers, both of which will be very common in emerging wireless broadband OFDM standards.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2008.925755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04563461.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2008.925755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","startPage":"545","endPage":"548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Loading Using Order Mapping in OFDM Systems With Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Loading Using Order Mapping in OFDM Systems With Limited Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10437309","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563461/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Loading Using Order Mapping in OFDM Systems With Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064277S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4563461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563477,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Enabled by progress in ultrafast digital signal processing electronics, it can carry 4 bits per symbol and has been proposed for 100-Gb/s transmission at a reduced 25-GBaud line rate. Several different receiver structures are possible, whose performance, complexity, and design issues are varied. In this letter, we concentrate on a receiver employing single-ended, rather than balanced, detection. We analyzed its performance and found that, by properly tailoring its design parameters, the single-ended receiver may closely approach the performance of the more expensive balanced receiver, over a

The cellular-phone industry, the hearing-aid industry, and consumers have been seeking a solution for the interference issue. Efforts reported in the literature have focused on measurements, modeling, and evaluation of interference and RF emission, but not on methods to solve the problem. In this paper, we focus on the causes of the interference and an understanding of the problem. We also present a method to reduce near-field electromagnetic energy around a cellular phone, mitigating the interference between cellular phones and hearing aids. The theoretical investigation of both the radiation mechanisms and fundamental limits on antennas suggested that a low-g antenna, such as an ultra-wideband antenna, could reduce the near-field intensity. Simulations and measurements were performed at 900 and 1880 MHz, using both low- and high-Q test antennas mounted on a mock cellular phone. The results showed that the peak electric and magnetic near-field strengths of the low-g test antenna were lower than those of a high-Q test antenna by at least 5 dBV/m and 4 dBA/m, respectively. The improvement in the near-field performance for the low-g antenna was without any sacrifice in far-field performance. Furthermore, in the presence of a human head, the simulation results showed that the radiation efficiency of the low-Q test antenna was better than that of the high-Q test antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/4559625/04563564.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"65","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2008.4563564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2008.4563564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4559625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular-Phone and Hearing-Aid Interaction: An Antenna Solution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular phones","Testing","Ultra wideband antennas","Antenna theory","Hearing aids","Electromagnetic measurements","Electromagnetic radiative interference","Radiofrequency interference","Radio frequency","Electromagnetic radiation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","electromagnetic waves","hearing aids","radiofrequency interference","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital cellular phones","hearing-aid interaction","antenna solution","interference issue","near-field electromagnetic energy","ultra-wideband antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cellular-Phone and Hearing-Aid Interaction: An Antenna Solution","volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4563564/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10117727","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular-Phone and Hearing-Aid Interaction: An Antenna Solution","sourcePdf":"502008-Taeyoung-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07207S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4559625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4559625","articleId":"4563564","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4563602,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Cakir","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Kocaeli University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/4559625/4563602/4563602-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":[""]},"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Cakir","id":"38187355900"},{"name":"Gonca Cakir","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Kocaeli University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gonca","lastName":"Cakir","id":"38189074000"},{"name":"Levent Sevgi","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Dog\u011fus\u015f University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Levent","lastName":"Sevgi","id":"37273499500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9243"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4143"}],"articleNumber":"4563602","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Metamaterials (MTM) have become a major electromagnetic research topic.

The increasing demands for computation times as the complexity of the simulation increases (e.g., increased sectorization order, smart antennas, etc., or combining system with link-level simulations) soon become prohibitively high. A WCDMA simulation is essentially a Monte Carlo simulation, consisting of a large number of identical and independent processes, which are viable for efficient and cost-effective distributed processing on a grid infrastructure. In the work presented herein, a problem-solving environment (PSE) has been implemented for grid-enabled execution of WCDMA simulations on the production grid infrastructure deployed by the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE (EGEE) project. The problem-solving environment provides a secure, Web-based portal for interacting with the grid middleware (e.g., job submission and monitoring, result retrieval, etc.). The grid-enabled simulator is presented, and implementation details are discussed. Simulation results and grid execution statistics are also shown, in order to demonstrate the validity of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and Evaluation of a Web- Based Grid-Enabled Environment for WCDMA Multibeam System Simulations [Wireless Corner]","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2008.4563610","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/4559625/04563610.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2008.4563610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4559625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4563610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and Evaluation of a Web- Based Grid-Enabled Environment for WCDMA Multibeam System Simulations [Wireless Corner]","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4563610/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10117738","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and Evaluation of a Web- Based Grid-Enabled Environment for WCDMA Multibeam System Simulations [Wireless Corner]","sourcePdf":"502008-T-60.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069073S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4559625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4559625","articleId":"4563610","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4563668,"authors":[{"name":"Yanli Qu","affiliation":["Centre for Micro and Nano Systems, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","State Key Laboratory of Robotic, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/4636867/4563668/4563668-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanli Qu received the Ph.D. degree in electromechanical engineering from Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenyang, China, in 2002.","Since 2002, she has been with Shenyang Institute of Automation, CAS, where she is currently an Associate Professor.

The sensors were fabricated on glass substrates by batch assembling electronics-grade CNTs (EG-CNTs) as sensing elements between microelectrode pairs using dielectrophoretic technique. Then, the CNT sensors were permanently integrated in glass-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channels by using standard glass-PDMS bonding process. Upon exposure to deionized (DI) water flow in the microchannel, the characteristics of the CNT sensors were investigated at room temperature under constant current (CC) mode. The specific electrical responses of the CNT sensors at different currents have been measured. It was found that the electrical resistance of the CNT sensors increased noticeably in response to the introduction of fluid shear stress when low activation current (Lt1 mA) was used, and unexpectedly decreased when the current exceeded 5 mA. We have shown that the sensor could be activated using input currents as low as 100 muA to measure the flow shear stress. The experimental results showed that the output resistance change could be plotted as a linear function of the shear stress to the one-third power. This result proved that the EG-CNT sensors can be operated as conventional thermal flow sensors but only require ultra-low activation power ( ~ 1 muW), which is ~ 1000 times lower than the conventional MEMS thermal flow sensors.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2008.928572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/4636867/04563668.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2008.928572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4636867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Low-Powered Aqueous Shear Stress Sensors Based on Bulk EG-CNTs Integrated in Microfluidic Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Low-Powered Aqueous Shear Stress Sensors Based on Bulk EG-CNTs Integrated in Microfluidic Systems","volume":"7","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10251318","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4563668/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4563668/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Low-Powered Aqueous Shear Stress Sensors Based on Bulk EG-CNTs Integrated in Microfluidic Systems","sourcePdf":"07tnano05-qu-928572.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078416S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"4636867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4636867","articleId":"4563668","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4563841,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In addition, RAISE adopts the k- anonymity property for preserving user privacy, where a message cannot be associated with a common vehicle. In the case of the absence of an RSU, we further propose a supplementary scheme, where vehicles would cooperatively work to probabilistically verify only a small percentage of these message signatures based on their own computing capacity. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed scheme. It is demonstrated that RAISE yields a much better performance than previously reported counterparts in terms of message loss ratio (LR) and delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564108/","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4564108/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10312182","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Message Authentication Scheme for Vehicular Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Message Authentication Scheme for Vehicular Communications","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109098S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4564108","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564183,"authors":[{"name":"F\u00c1bio D'Agostini","affiliation":["Centro de Pesquisa em Tecnologias Wireless-CPTW, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre-RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"F\u00c1bio","lastName":"D'Agostini","id":"37085924879"},{"name":"Sirlesio Carboni","affiliation":["Centro de Pesquisa em Tecnologias Wireless-CPTW, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre-RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sirlesio","lastName":"Carboni","id":"38078369000"},{"name":"Maria C.

Interpolation is applied between pilot carriers to determine the channel transfer function in all carrier frequencies. Channel variations along time are compensated by means of interpolation between successive channel estimates on the same carrier frequency. However, not rarely do fast channel variations exceed the time interpolator capability, as is the case for mobile operation. In this article we propose a new technique based on concurrent de- convolution, as a mean to further increase the time interpolator capability. Concurrent deconvolution, also known as concurrent equalization, is based on the concurrent operation of two stochastic gradient time-domain algorithms. One gradient-based algorithm minimizes a cost function that measures the received signal energy dispersion and the other minimizes the Euclidean distance between the received digital modulation symbols and the ones in the reference constellation which are assigned to each OFDM sub-channel. Results show that the proposed technique, when subsequently applied to the time interpolation stage, improves the system robustness for fast varying channels. The whole channel compensation computational cost is increased by the cost of a two coefficient multirate adaptive FIR filter, added only to those subcarriers at the FFT output to which a pilot sequence has not been assigned.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2008.2001145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4604791/04564183.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2008.2001145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604791","startPage":"441","endPage":"447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Concurrent Equalization Applied to Multicarrier OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Concurrent Equalization Applied to Multicarrier OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180149","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4564183/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Concurrent Equalization Applied to Multicarrier OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-dagostini-2001145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081624S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4604791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4604791","articleId":"4564183","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4564184,"authors":[{"name":"Earl Zastrow $^*$","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4711410/4564184/4564184-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Earl Zastrow (S'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 2003 and 2005, respectively, from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Her current research interests include microwave imaging and bioelectromagnetics, including hyperthermia treatment of breast and brain cancer as well as the interactions between electromagnetic waves and biological tissues.","Ms. Zastrow was the recipient of the 2007 Qualcomm \u201cQ\u201d Award of Excellence Scholarship."]},"firstName":"Earl","lastName":"Zastrow $^*$","id":"37540741900"},{"name":"Shakti K.

In this paper, we report the development of a collection of anatomically realistic 3-D numerical breast phantoms of varying shape, size, and radiographic density which can readily be used in finite-difference time-domain computational electromagnetics models. The phantoms are derived from T1-weighted MRIs of prone patients. Each MRI is transformed into a uniform grid of dielectric properties using several steps. First, the structure of each phantom is identified by applying image processing techniques to the MRI. Next, the voxel intensities of the MRI are converted to frequency-dependent and tissue-dependent dielectric properties of normal breast tissues via a piecewise-linear map. The dielectric properties of normal breast tissue are taken from the recently completed large-scale experimental study of normal breast tissue dielectric properties conducted by the Universities of Wisconsin and Calgary. The comprehensive collection of numerical phantoms is made available to the scientific community through an online repository.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.2002130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4711410/04564184.pdf","startPage":"2792","endPage":"2800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.2002130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Anatomically Realistic Numerical Breast Phantoms With Accurate Dielectric Properties for Modeling Microwave Interactions With the Human Breast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564184/","displayDocTitle":"Development of Anatomically Realistic Numerical Breast Phantoms With Accurate Dielectric Properties for Modeling Microwave Interactions With the Human Breast","volume":"55","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370731","pubMedId":"19126460","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564184/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Anatomically Realistic Numerical Breast Phantoms With Accurate Dielectric Properties for Modeling Microwave Interactions With the Human Breast","sourcePdf":"tbme-zastrow-2002130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117973S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4711410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"193","xplore-issue":"4711410","articleId":"4564184","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564193,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiano Cervellera","affiliation":["Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Studi sui Sistemi Intelligenti per I''Automazione, Genoa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4588974/4564193/4564193-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nCristiano Cervellera received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering and computer science from the University of Genoa, Italy, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.","Since 2002, he has been a Researcher at the Genoa branch of the Institute of Intelligent Systems for Automation of the Italian National Research Council.

Indeed, PKC involves large operands (160 to 1024 bits) and several researchers proposed carry-save or borrow-save algorithms. However, these number systems do not take advantage of the dedicated carry logic available in modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). To overcome this problem, we suggest to perform modular multiplication in a high-radix carry-save number system, where a sum bit of the carry-save representation is replaced by a sum word. Two digits are then added by means of a small Carry-Ripple Adder (CRA). Furthermore, we propose an algorithm which selects the best high-radix carry-save representation for a given modulus, and generates a synthesizable VHDL description of the operator.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4670333/04564441.pdf","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Generation of Modular Multipliers for FPGA Applications","volume":"57","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10302143","htmlLink":"/document/4564441/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Generation of Modular Multipliers for FPGA Applications","sourcePdf":"ttc2008121600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095099S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4670333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4670333","articleId":"4564441","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4564442,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Luc Beuchat","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Beuchat","id":"37283944800"},{"name":"Nicolas Brisebarre","affiliation":["Projet Arenaire, LIP, Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Brisebarre","id":"37283934400"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Detrey","affiliation":["Cosec Group, Bonn-Aachen International Center for Information Technology, Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","lastName":"Detrey","id":"38093484700"},{"name":"Eiji Okamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37296650100"},{"name":"Masaaki Shirase","affiliation":["School of Systems Information Science, Future University-Hakodate, Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Shirase","id":"37317984200"},{"name":"Tsuyoshi Takagi","affiliation":["School of Systems Information Science, Future University-Hakodate, Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Takagi","id":"37308426500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"4564442","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":312},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curves","Equations","Cryptography","Security","Software algorithms","Elliptic curve cryptography","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","mathematical operators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic operators","etaT pairing","characteristic three","constructive cryptographic application","hyperelliptic curves","hardware accelerator","unified arithmetic operator","compact coprocessor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eta_T pairing","elliptic curve","finite field arithmetic","hardware accelerator","FPGA"]},{"kwd":["Eta_T pairing","elliptic curve","finite field arithmetic","hardware accelerator","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Since their introduction in constructive cryptographic applications, pairings over (hyper)elliptic curves are at the heart of an ever increasing number of protocols.

The first problem has applications in general multiprocessor computing systems where energy consumption is an important concern and in mobile computers where energy conservation is a main concern. The second problem has applications in real-time multiprocessing systems where timing constraint is a major requirement. These problems emphasize the tradeoff between power and performance and are defined such that the power-performance product is optimized by fixing one factor and minimizing the other. It is found that both problems are equivalent to the sum of powers problem and can be decomposed into two subproblems, namely, scheduling tasks and determining power supplies. Such decomposition makes design and analysis of heuristic algorithms tractable. We analyze the performance of list scheduling algorithms and equal-speed algorithms and prove that these algorithms are asymptotically optimal. Our extensive simulation data validate our analytical results and provide deeper insight into the performance of our heuristic algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564443/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564443/","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10236412","volume":"19","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Power-Aware Task Scheduling Algorithms on Multiprocessor Computers with Dynamic Voltage and Speed","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Power-Aware Task Scheduling Algorithms on Multiprocessor Computers with Dynamic Voltage and Speed","sourcePdf":"ttd2008111484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131029S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4637367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4637367","articleId":"4564443","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4564455,"authors":[{"name":"Aristides Gionis","affiliation":["Yahoo Research, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4731207/4564455/4564455-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aristides Gionis received the PhD degree from Stanford University in 2003.

To support effective learning, an e-learning system should be able to discover and make use of the semantic communities and the emerging semantic relations in a dynamic complex network of learning resources. Previous graph-based community discovery approaches are limited in ability to discover semantic communities. This paper first suggests the semantic link network (SLN), a loosely coupled semantic data model that can semantically link resources and derive out implicit semantic links according to a set of relational reasoning rules. By studying the intrinsic relationship between semantic communities and the semantic space of SLN, approaches to discovering reasoning-constraint, rule-constraint, and classification-constraint semantic communities are proposed. Further, the approaches, principles, and strategies for discovering emerging semantics in dynamic SLNs are studied. The basic laws of the semantic link network motion are revealed for the first time. An e-learning environment incorporating the proposed approaches, principles, and strategies to support effective discovery and learning is suggested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564467/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10588848","volume":"21","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Communities and Emerging Semantics in Semantic Link Network: Discovery and Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communities and Emerging Semantics in Semantic Link Network: Discovery and Learning","sourcePdf":"ttk2009060785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089308S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4840270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"4840270","articleId":"4564467","onlineDate":"15 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564481,"authors":[{"name":"Mihail L.

Their main advantage is that they bypass the need for expensive infrastructure; their major drawback is the comparatively complex networking protocols and the need for significant penetration before their applications can become effective. In this article we present several major classes of applications and the types of services they require from an underlying network. We then proceed to analyze existing networking protocols in a bottom-up fashion, from the physical to the transport layers, as well as security aspects related to IVC systems. We conclude the article by presenting several projects related to IVC as well as a review of common performance evaluation techniques for IVC systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564481/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2008","publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564481/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117106","volume":"10","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Inter-vehicle communication systems: a survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-vehicle communication systems: a survey","sourcePdf":"7SICHITIU.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145595S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"4564474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"304","xplore-issue":"4564474","articleId":"4564481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4564487,"authors":[{"name":"Walid G.

Since harmonic distortion has harmful effects on the electric power system, there is a need to analyze and hence accurately measure their values which is an issue of great concern especially in a deregulated environment. Conventional Fourier based analyzing tools have some limitations concerning frequency and time resolutions. Although wavelet transform overcomes these limitations, it suffers from the problem of spectral leakage which is related to the choice of the wavelet family and the mother wavelet used in the analysis. In order to minimize these errors, this paper presents an approach to select the most suitable wavelet family and the most suitable mother wavelet to achieve accurate measurement of steady-state harmonic distortion using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The proposed algorithm is simple and proves to be accurate when applied to two cases of different distortion level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The most suitable mother wavelet for steady-state power system distorted waveforms","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564487","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564487.pdf","startPage":"000017","endPage":"000022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"The most suitable mother wavelet for steady-state power system distorted waveforms","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564487/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10090863","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The most suitable mother wavelet for steady-state power system distorted waveforms","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080101S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4564498,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim M.

In this paper, we have tackled the aperiodic autocorrelation factor and based on it, two algorithms have been proposed. In the first algorithm, called selective autocorrelation (SA), the value of first aperiodic autocorrelation coefficient is minimized to 1 for reducing the PAPR. In the second algorithm, called selected sequences with variable autocorrelation SLM (SSVA), multiple sequences are generated by modifying a fixed number of complex numbers. The one giving minimum PAPR is transmitted. Simulation results show significant reduction in PAPR. Further a novel technique based on data insertion is used to handle the side information generated by the two algorithms without degrading the PAPR performance.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564498","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564498.pdf","startPage":"000071","endPage":"000076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction of OFDM signals using autocorrelation based SLM without side information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564498/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction of OFDM signals using autocorrelation based SLM without side information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103590","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564498/","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction of OFDM signals using autocorrelation based SLM without side information","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038603S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4564500,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmood Movassagh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Movassagh","id":"38093646100"},{"name":"Ali Asghar Beheshti Shirazi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali Asghar","lastName":"Beheshti Shirazi","id":"38556572400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564500","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Wavelet transforms","Frequency","Humans","Robustness","Protection","Discrete wavelet transforms","Quantization","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time audio watermarking","wavelet transform","index modulation technique","MP3 compression","low pass filtering","resampling","requantizing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio Watermarking","Real-Time","Wavelet Transform","Quantization Index Modulation (QIM)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel method for audio watermarking which is appropriate for real-time applications.

The proposed controller combines three sub-controllers. The zero-sequence controller maintains the difference between the upper and the lower DC output voltages equal to zero. The q-axis controller keeps the power factor equal to 1. The d-axis controller is used to meet active power and DC output voltage specifications, despite balanced or unbalanced load conditions. Converter and AC voltage source parameters (amplitude and frequency) are assumed unknown. A robust adaptive nonlinear control law is derived from a backstepping procedure and helps to stabilize the system and attenuate unknown parameters effects. The adaptation laws are based on the projection method and guarantee that estimated parameters converge and remain inside predefined domains. The main advantage of the proposed design approach is its simplicity due to the fact that sub-controller designs are decoupled, and their gains are independently tuned. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the performance of the new robust adaptive controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Rectifiers","Voltage control","Reactive power","Frequency conversion","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Backstepping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","adaptive control","nonlinear control systems","rectifying circuits","robust control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase three-level neutral-point clamped rectifier","DC output voltage control","power factor control","boost rectifier","zero-sequence controller","power converter","AC voltage source parameters","robust adaptive nonlinear control law","backstepping procedure","adaptation laws","projection method","sub-controller designs","q-axis controller","d-axis controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust Adaptive Control","Power Converter Control","Neutral Point Clamped Rectifier","Multilevel Converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564502","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564502.pdf","startPage":"000095","endPage":"000100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust adaptive controller for a three-phase three-level neutral-point clamped rectifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A robust adaptive controller for a three-phase three-level neutral-point clamped rectifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564502/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564502/","accessionNumber":"10103594","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust adaptive controller for a three-phase three-level neutral-point clamped rectifier","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074891S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4564506,"authors":[{"name":"Zohreh Motamedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Canada"],"firstName":"Zohreh","lastName":"Motamedi","id":"37297004100"},{"name":"M.

The NABF uses multichannel linear prediction error filters (LPEFs) in the sidelobe canceling path and adaptive noise estimation filters (ANEFs) in the multi-channel noise canceller. Since the AEC module is located behind the fixed beamformer of the NABF only one AEC module is required and the AEC does not feel any repercussions from the NABF. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated scheme (AECNABF), it is compared to the multi-channel acoustic echo canceller (AEC-first) which provide good performance but at the expense of very high computational complexity. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is comparable to that of AEC-first scheme with very less computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564508","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564508.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564508","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","startPage":"000123","endPage":"000128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new adaptive beamformer for optimal acoustic echo and noise cancellation with less computational load","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive beamformer for optimal acoustic echo and noise cancellation with less computational load","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564508/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564508/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103599","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive beamformer for optimal acoustic echo and noise cancellation with less computational load","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066465S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4564509,"authors":[{"name":"Taimour Aldalgamouni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Taimour","lastName":"Aldalgamouni","id":"37601303900"},{"name":"Ahmed Elhakeem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Elhakeem","id":"37269433800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564509","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Bit error rate","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Channel estimation","Fading","Phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","OFDM","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink SFBC-MIMO-CDMA systems","bit error rate","BER performance","space-frequency block-code","multiple input multiple output systems","code-division multiple- access systems","channel estimation errors","Rayleigh fading channels","phase shift keying array","quadrature amplitude modulation techniques","network management","cross-layer design"]}],"abstract":"Closed form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) performance of the down link of the space- frequency block-coded multiple input multiple output code-division multiple-access (SFBC-MIMO-CDMA) systems are derived and evaluated.

The proposed method adaptively determines the search area for motion estimation. The maximum number of search points for finding the best matched block is lower than that of the PVSSA. Although the proposed algorithm is similar to the PVSSA in terms of regularity, it has lower computational complexity. To find the search area the temporal and spatial correlations among the motion vectors of the image blocks are exploited. Based on this, a matched block is chosen from a rectangular area that the prediction vectors set out. We have evaluated the algorithm through a comprehensive performance study that shows that the proposed algorithm achieves substantial speedup without quality loss for a wide range of video sequences, compared with other motion estimation techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564550.pdf","startPage":"000331","endPage":"000334","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive block matching algorithm for motion estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Layout","Computational complexity","Performance loss","Video sequences","Difference equations","Search methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive block matching algorithm","motion estimation","predicted vector spectral search algorithm","image blocks","matched block","PVSSA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion estimation","block matching","search area","temporal correlation","spatial correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive block matching algorithm for motion estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564550/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103666","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive block matching algorithm for motion estimation","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086295S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564556,"authors":[{"name":"Basak Can","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Basak","lastName":"Can","id":"37710054600"},{"name":"Maciej Portalski","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Portalski","id":"37712576100"},{"name":"Yannick Le Moullec","affiliation":["Aalborg Universitet, Aalborg, DK"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Le Moullec","id":"37568112100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564556","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":107},"abstract":"Hardware aspects of infrastructure based (i.e., fixed) relay station design with focus on digital baseband processing in OFDM(A) based systems are investigated. A novel architecture for the digital baseband processor for fixed relay stations is proposed to minimize the relay complexity and the implementation cost. Two methods of signal forwarding -amplify and forward (AF) and -decode and forward (DF) are developed and implemented on FPGA, exploiting parallel processing and a pipelined system architecture. In contrast to common heuristic conclusions existing in the literature, we conclude that the AF based implementation introduces significant hardware complexity resulting from high memory usage. On the other hand, the DF implementation requires higher clocking frequencies, making it more power-consuming as compared to AF-based relaying.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564556.pdf","startPage":"000355","endPage":"000360","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware aspects of fixed relay station design for OFDM(A) based wireless relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Power system relaying","Digital relays","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless communication","Costs","Baseband","Signal design","Energy consumption","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","field programmable gate arrays","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed relay station design","OFDMA","wireless relay networks","digital baseband processing","amplify and forward","decode and forward","relay complexity","FPGA","parallel processing","pipelined system architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fixed relay station","wireless relay network","Implementation","FPGA","Design space exploration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hardware aspects of fixed relay station design for OFDM(A) based wireless relay networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564556/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103672","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware aspects of fixed relay station design for OFDM(A) based wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072479S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4564562,"authors":[{"name":"James D.

In this paper, we present a very fast simulated re-annealing placement algorithm for analog VLSI layout design. We show that this algorithm is exponentially faster than either Cauchy or Boltzmann annealing. The functionality of the re-annealing is to perform an adaptive control on the annealing schedules of multidimensional parameters. Moreover, a cell-slide-based flat placement style satisfying various symmetry constraints pertaining to analog layout design is developed to drastically reduce the solution space without degrading the search opportunities. The dedicated cost function covers the special requirements for analog integrated circuits, including area, wire length, aspect ratio, proximity, parasitic effects, etc. The proposed algorithm has been applied to layout several analog circuits, and it appears superior to the conventional approaches with significantly less amount of CPU time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","startPage":"000547","endPage":"000550","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564594.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An easy tune-up exponentially fast annealer for high-quality analog module placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4564594/","displayDocTitle":"An easy tune-up exponentially fast annealer for high-quality analog module placement","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10117137","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An easy tune-up exponentially fast annealer for high-quality analog module placement","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068985S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564595,"authors":[{"name":"David Hermann","affiliation":["AMI Semiconductors, Inc., Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hermann","id":"37270553200"},{"name":"Edward Chau","affiliation":["AMI Semiconductors, Inc., Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Chau","id":"37285114300"},{"name":"Robert D.

In the first estimation method, the cascaded channel consisting of source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links is estimated at the destination terminal. In the second estimation method, the estimation of cascaded channel is disintegrated into separate estimations of source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links which are carried out at the relay and destination terminals, respectively. The latter method involves feed-forwarding a quantized version of the source-to-relay channel estimate to the destination terminal. Our simulation results demonstrate that cascaded channel estimator outperforms its competitor with small number of quantization bits. As the number of employed quantization bits increase, disintegrated channel estimator approaches to its competitor eventually outperforming it.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564608","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564608.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","startPage":"000615","endPage":"000618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two channel estimation methods for amplify-and-forward relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two channel estimation methods for amplify-and-forward relay networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564608/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103744","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4564608/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two channel estimation methods for amplify-and-forward relay networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058807S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564611,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Frequency domain noise reduction techniques are often defined in terms of the a priori SNR. A widely used method to determine the a priori SNR from noisy speech is the decision directed (DD) approach. In the DD approach the a priori SNR depends on the speech spectrum estimation in the previous frame which degrades the noise reduction performance. To overcome this problem a sigmoid type weighting function is proposed with a modified a priori SNR estimator. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by two objective tests under various noisy environments and it is found that the proposed sigmoidal-shaped gain function produces significant improvements in noise reduction performance compared to that of the conventional Wiener gain.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564612","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564612.pdf","startPage":"000631","endPage":"000636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech enhancement employing a sigmoid -type gain function with a modified a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564612/","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement employing a sigmoid -type gain function with a modified a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10117154","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564612/","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement employing a sigmoid -type gain function with a modified a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimator","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048365S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564614,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For reason of using pipeline arithmetic units, we can reach to high speeds. The dissipated power of circuit is decreased because of using 3.3 volts power supply, pipeline arithmetic units, having small fan-out in each multiplier cell, using delay buffers instead of D flip-flops and so on. For transistor implementation of this circuit, TSPC logic is used. By using simulator, transistor sizes are adjusted for suitable performance, speed increasing and dissipated power decreasing without any difference sizes in similar units. By using of these logic and technology, area of circuit decreases very much. The total dissipated power is 50 mW in 300 kb/s input bit rate.

The tool is developed in the context of a HW/SW partitioning tool. Rather than modeling the hardware implementation as a single alternative, our approach for HW/SW partitioning models the hardware as two extreme alternatives that bound latency range for different hardware implementations. The presented estimation tool estimates the area and latency for these two hardware alternatives. The computational cost of the presented estimation tool depends linearly on the design complexity, and hence, it is very useful for fast design space exploration. Testing this estimation tool on several designs showed that this tool is also accurate. Area estimations are within plusmn7.5% of the actual number of logic elements consumed with an average error of 3.2% for Cyclone FPGAs and 3.5% for Stratix FPGAs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast FPGA-based area and latency estimation for a novel hardware/software partitioning scheme","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564641","startPage":"000775","endPage":"000780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564641.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast FPGA-based area and latency estimation for a novel hardware/software partitioning scheme","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564641/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10117160","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast FPGA-based area and latency estimation for a novel hardware/software partitioning scheme","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107564S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4564642,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Frejek","affiliation":["Mechatronic and Robotic Systems Laboratory, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Frejek","id":"38093591900"},{"name":"Scott Nokleby","affiliation":["Mechatronic and Robotic Systems Laboratory, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Canada"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Nokleby","id":"38093650800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564642","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Remotely operated vehicles","Mobile robots","Propulsion","Legged locomotion","Humans","Wheels","Robot sensing systems","Navigation","Mechatronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic guided vehicles","control system synthesis","microcontrollers","path planning","wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous amphibious vehicle","path planning","modular buoyancy attachments","control algorithm","amphibious vehicle design","paddle wheels","microcontroller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous Amphibious Vehicle (AAV)","Paddle Wheel","GPS","Path Planning"]}],"abstract":"A detailed design of an autonomous amphibious vehicle (AAV) capable of traversing across aquatic and terrestrial environments is presented.

The proposed signal detection scheme aims to reduce the number of channelized radiometers in the FHSS receiver. It is based upon the concept of back propagation neural networks (BPN). The system is first trained using a training signal and weights of different layers in BPN are configured by an iterative process. This scheme was implemented on a simulated FHSS system which had a hopping bandwidth of 26 MHz. The system hopped once for every eight symbols. Nine band pass filters were used to cover the entire hopping bandwidth. The proposed scheme aspires to reduce system complexity and intends to make it more robust and flexible. This system is designed for software based transceivers.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564645","startPage":"000797","endPage":"000800","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564645.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency estimation using back-propagation neural networks for a frequency hopped spread spectrum receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Neural networks","Spread spectrum communication","Signal detection","Bandwidth","Radiometers","Signal processing","Band pass filters","Robustness","Software design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","backpropagation","band-pass filters","frequency estimation","frequency hop communication","iterative methods","neural nets","radio receivers","signal detection","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication computing","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive frequency estimation","back-propagation neural networks","frequency hopped spread spectrum receiver","signal detection","channelized radiometers","iterative process","band pass filters","software based transceivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive frequency Estimation","Frequency Hop Communication","Neural Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency estimation using back-propagation neural networks for a frequency hopped spread spectrum receiver","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564645/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103780","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency estimation using back-propagation neural networks for a frequency hopped spread spectrum receiver","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066478S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4564646,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Sghaier","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Sghaier","id":"37692676200"},{"name":"Shawki Areibi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shawki","lastName":"Areibi","id":"37276434400"},{"name":"Bob Dony","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Dony","id":"38093493800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564646","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"abstract":"The principles of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation have been around since 1960s. However, recently, the attention toward OFDM has grown dramatically in the field of wireless and wired communication systems. This is reflected by the adoption of this technique in applications such as digital audio/video broadcast (DAB/DVB), wireless LAN (802.11a and HiperLAN2), broadband wireless (802.16) and xDSL. In parallel, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are also emerging as a fundamental paradigm in the implementation of these standards. This is due to their increased capabilities (speed and resources). Moreover, the FPGApsilas programmability make them a preferable choice for evolving standards in comparison with ASIC fixed designs. In this work, a pure VHDL design, integrated with some intellectual property (IP) blocks, is employed to implement an OFDM transmitter according to the IEEE 802.11a WLAN standard. The proposed design has been mapped and tested on Xilinx Virtex-II Pro (XC2VP30-7ff896) FPGA, and approximately 25% of the total available fabric was occupied.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564646.pdf","startPage":"000801","endPage":"000804","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pipelined implementation of OFDM transmission on reconfigurable platforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital video broadcasting","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Digital audio broadcasting","Application specific integrated circuits","Intellectual property","Transmitters","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","digital audio broadcasting","digital subscriber lines","digital video broadcasting","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","OFDM modulation","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined implementation","OFDM transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation","wireless communication systems","wired communication systems","digital audio-video broadcast","wireless LAN","broadband wireless","xDSL","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","ASIC fixed designs","VHDL design","intellectual property blocks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","VHDL","OFDM","802.11a"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A pipelined implementation of OFDM transmission on reconfigurable platforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564646/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103781","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pipelined implementation of OFDM transmission on reconfigurable platforms","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038143S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4564650,"authors":[{"name":"Farnaz Shayegh","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Farnaz","lastName":"Shayegh","id":"37397297400"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Soleymani","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Soleymani","id":"37285147900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564650","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Lattices","Maximum likelihood detection","Signal to noise ratio","Data communication","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Error correction","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","receivers","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere decoding","MIMO detection","multiple-input multiple-output maximum-likelihood detection","suboptimum receiver","channel matrix","vector detection"]}],"abstract":"A new low complexity sphere decoding method for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) maximum-likelihood (ML) detection is proposed. One method that reduces the complexity of sphere decoding is the decoding order of MIMO sphere decoder using the soft-output signal of a suboptimum receiver as a reference. We refer to this method as ordered sphere decoder and we try to reduce its complexity. In order to do this, we use the reliability information of the transmitted vector to do channel ordering. This means that we make decisions on the elements of the transmitted vector starting from its most reliable element. To this end, we arrange the reliabilities in an increasing order. This ordering will define a permutation. The elements of the reference signal and also the columns of the channel matrix will be arranged according to this permutation. Then, we detect the permuted transmitted vector using ordered sphere decoder with the new permuted channel matrix and reference signal. In our proposed method, we start detecting the transmitted vector from its most reliable element and for each element, we start from the most probable transmitted symbol based on the information from the reference signal. This kind of ordering will help finding the candidate transmitted vectors quickly. Our method results in reducing the complexity of sphere decoder specially in low signal to noise ratios without compromising the performance of ML detection.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564650","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","startPage":"000821","endPage":"000826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity implementations of sphere decoding for MIMO detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity implementations of sphere decoding for MIMO detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564650/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103783","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4564650/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity implementations of sphere decoding for MIMO detection","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049957S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4564653,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Farzam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Farzam","id":"37397291500"},{"name":"Soosan Beheshti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Soosan","lastName":"Beheshti","id":"37397290600"},{"name":"Kaamran Raahemifar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Kaamran","lastName":"Raahemifar","id":"37273545200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564653","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564653","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Genetic algorithms","Pixel","Layout","Spatial resolution","Spectral analysis","Image resolution","Least squares methods","Hyperspectral sensors","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image resolution","least mean squares methods","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral imaging","genetic algorithm","spatial image resolution","satellite imaging system","mixed-pixel decomposition","mathematical intractability","least square error","endmember estimation","EM matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Genetic algorithm","Spectral unmixing","Virtual Dimensionality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564653","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564653.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","startPage":"000837","endPage":"000842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of abundance factors in hyperspectral imaging using genetic algorithm","abstract":"Spatial resolution is a limiting factor in satellite imaging systems. It is usually very difficult to successfully interpret objects from a coarse resolution image. Images at such coarse resolutions result in mixed pixels. Mixed-pixel decomposition or spectral unmixing applies to derivation of constituent components, endmembers(EM), and their fractional proportions(abundances) at the subpixel scale. The mathematical intractability of the abundance non-negative constraint results in complex and extensive numerical approaches. Due to such mathematical intractability, many least square error(LSE) based methods are unconstrained and can only produce sub-optimal solutions. In this paper we propose a mixed genetic algorithm and LSE-based EM estimation method (LSEM) to extract the EM matrix and related abundances vectors. We apply the proposed GA-LSEM method to the subject of unmixing hyperspectral data. The experimental results obtained from simulated images show the effectiveness of the proposed method, specifically the robustness to noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564653/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10103784","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564653/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Calculation of abundance factors in hyperspectral imaging using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of abundance factors in hyperspectral imaging using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060408S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4564662,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Chen","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, Saint John's, Canada"],"lastName":"Shi Chen","id":"37087742205"},{"name":"Ramachandran Venkatesan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, Saint John's, Canada"],"firstName":"Ramachandran","lastName":"Venkatesan","id":"38359790700"},{"name":"Paul Gillard","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, Saint John's, Canada"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Gillard","id":"37389652200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564662","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","High performance computing","Registers","Floating-point arithmetic","CMOS technology","Computer architecture","Logic","Read-write memory","Signal generators","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector floating-point processing unit","FPGA","high performance computing","high accuracy scientific computing","core module","vector register file","floating point adder","floating point multiplier","flag register","Xilinx Virtex II Pro","computer speed 3.02 GFLOPS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vector processing","floating point arithmetic operation","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"A vector floating point unit (VFPU) for high accuracy scientific computing is reported.

The geometric mean decomposition (GMD) when combined with BLAST detection can provide the same diversity order as a more complex ML detector without sacrificing the rate of the MIMO system. The main obstacle to the practical implementation of this scheme is whether or not it performs well when the transmitter has limited feedback. In this paper we propose a decoder designed to be robust against quantization errors, as well as a quantizer that reduces the number of required feedback bits to approximate the performance of GMD when it has infinite feedback for an N times M MIMO system. Our results show that we can reduce the amount of feedback bits from 64 to 10 bits for a 2 times 2 and require only 30 bits for a 3times3 MIMO system, while achieving performance nearly identical to infinite feedback case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564677.pdf","startPage":"000951","endPage":"000956","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust transceiver design for geometric mean decomposition systems with limited precoder feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Transceivers","Feedback","Transmitters","MIMO","Detectors","Maximum likelihood decoding","Transmitting antennas","Channel state information","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","feedback","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","precoding","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust transceiver design","geometric mean decomposition systems","precoder feedback","slow-time-variant multiple-input multiple-output channel","MIMO channel","channel state information","BLAST detection","maximum likelihood detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust transceiver design for geometric mean decomposition systems with limited precoder feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564677/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103797","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust transceiver design for geometric mean decomposition systems with limited precoder feedback","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050797S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564682,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"lastName":"Bo Cao","id":"37087337602"},{"name":"Liuchen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"lastName":"Liuchen Chang","id":"37087149780"},{"name":"Howard Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"firstName":"Howard","lastName":"Li","id":"37539779200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564682","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Pulse width modulation","Control systems","PD control","Pi control","Proportional control","Field programmable gate arrays","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","photovoltaic power systems","power system control","radial basis function networks","system-on-chip","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RBF neural network","maximum power point tracking","radial basis function neural network","system on a programmable chip","photovoltaic control systems","proportional integral derivative controller","PID controller","pulse width modulation","field programmable gate array","FPGA chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MPPT","RBF","neural network","FPGA","SOPC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564682","abstract":"In this paper, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is implemented as a system on a programmable chip (SOPC) to carry out maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for photovoltaic (PV) control systems.

The preamble facilitates receiver acquisition of the spreading code alignment and this is essential for decoding the spread spectrum signal. Since packets are short, matched filters are employed to provide rapid acquisition and, in this case, we use a segmented matched filter that can provide codephase alignment even when there is data modulation. We thus eliminate the need for a packet preamble and improve the system throughput. However, if the matched filter fails to provide the correct codephase, a packet is lost. The probability of correct codephase detection (Pd) is increased by accumulating matched filter samples over several code cycles prior to making a decision. Using accumulated code cycles as a parameter, we present the probability of correctly detecting packet codephase as a function of the number of active co- users. Correct detection probabilities exceeding 99% are indicated from simulations with 25 co-users and 10 kHz Doppler shift or carrier frequency offset by accumulating five or more PN code cycles, using maximum selection detection criterion. Analysis and simulation also show that cyclic accumulation can improve packet throughput by 50% and by as much as 100% under conditions of high offered traffic and carrier frequency offset for both fixed capacity and infinite capacity packet systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput and PN codephase acquisition for packet CDMA without preamble","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564724","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564724.pdf","startPage":"001179","endPage":"001182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Throughput and PN codephase acquisition for packet CDMA without preamble","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564724/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10117195","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and PN codephase acquisition for packet CDMA without preamble","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067363S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4564726,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Regina, Regina, SAS, Canada"],"lastName":"Wei Jin","id":"37088159106"},{"name":"Chang N.

Many systolic designs have been reported. All are algorithm based, that is one design is only for solving one specific problem. In this paper, the special purpose systolic architecture has been extended into a reconfigurable one and a systematic design approach to mapping two or more algorithms into a single reconfigurable systolic array is presented. First multiple algorithms are mapped into a reconfigurable systolic array that is able to compute one algorithm at a time with proper control settings. Second the reconfigurable systolic array is extended by using time or space redundancy so that it can compute multiple algorithms simultaneously. In addition, the optimal mapping, which minimizes the total hardware cost and computation time, is explored and the necessary condition of the transformation for computing multiple problem instances is also proposed. According to this condition, the search space of finding the optimal mapping can be significantly reduced.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping multiple algorithms into a reconfigurable systolic array","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564726","endPage":"001192","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564726.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","startPage":"001187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564726","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systolic arrays","Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis","Very large scale integration","Pipeline processing","Concurrent computing","Redundancy","Hardware","Cost function","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel processing","pipeline processing","systolic arrays","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple algorithms","reconfigurable systolic array","VLSI architecture","extensive parallel computing","pipelining computing","optimal mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["systolic array","reconfigurable architecture","space-time mapping","systematic approach","optimal design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mapping multiple algorithms into a reconfigurable systolic array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564726/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117197","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping multiple algorithms into a reconfigurable systolic array","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041461S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4564734,"authors":[{"name":"Dongdong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"lastName":"Dongdong Chen","id":"37533340800"},{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"lastName":"Yu Zhang","id":"37538300000"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"lastName":"Li Chen","id":"37310786000"},{"name":"Daniel Teng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Teng","id":"37272647400"},{"name":"Khan Wahid","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"lastName":"Khan Wahid","id":"37282919600"},{"name":"Seok-Bum Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"lastName":"Seok-Bum Ko","id":"37072266800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564734","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel design and implementation of a 7-digit fixed-point decimal-to-decimal antilogarithmic converter.

This is especially true for an EIS system which might need to operate in a low frequency range as small as 100 Hz. In the system presented here, the amplitude and phase of the IF signal can be measured after digitizing the signal by an ADC in digital domain with transferring the IF signal to the baseband (zero frequency). In this system, a lowpass FIR filter and a variable frequency digital oscillator have been used.

Using an observation window encompassing many consecutive independent bits, our blind detector capitalizes on the fact that the atmospheric turbulence is constant over the observation window and that the expected number of transmitted 1s and 0 s are equal. To improve receiver performance beyond that of the initial blind detector, we also consider the use of decision-aided threshold estimation and a second detection stage, respectively. Provided that a sufficiently large observation window is employed, simulation results indicate that the proposed receiver can attain performance comparable to that of the lower performance bound given by detection with CSI.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564763","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564763.pdf","startPage":"001361","endPage":"001364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind detection of on-off keying for free-space optical communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind detection of on-off keying for free-space optical communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103846","htmlLink":"/document/4564763/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind detection of on-off keying for free-space optical communications","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0456S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564765,"authors":[{"name":"B.W.

In V-BLAST detection algorithm error propagation due to unreliable decision feedback severely limits the system performance. Here, we propose a new detection scheme that reduces the destructive effect of error propagation to a great extent. In our proposed detection algorithm, we have used ML detection to jointly estimate two strongest sub-streams of the transmitted data. For this purpose, we find an optimum beam-forming matrix to minimize the power of cumulative noise and the interfering sub-streams. It is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional V-BLAST MMSE algorithm with moderate increase in computational complexity. Nevertheless, our study shows that the complexity of our proposed algorithm is almost negligible compared to maximum likelihood detection.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564788","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564788.pdf","startPage":"001483","endPage":"001486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Groupwise successive interference cancellation for MIMO communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4564788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564788/","displayDocTitle":"Groupwise successive interference cancellation for MIMO communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10117112","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564788/","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Groupwise successive interference cancellation for MIMO communication systems","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051265S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4564792,"authors":[{"name":"Wilson Harron","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Wilson","lastName":"Harron","id":"37640439400"},{"name":"Calvin Pettinger","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Calvin","lastName":"Pettinger","id":"38093500500"},{"name":"Robert Dony","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Dony","id":"37273861300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564792","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Image recognition","Histograms","Layout","Pattern recognition","Testing","Books","Drugs","Pixel","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","image recognition","pattern recognition","histograms","random training images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["object recognition","pattern recognition","neural networks","Where\u2019s Waldo"]}],"abstract":"Scenes from ldquoWherepsilas Waldo?rdquo are used as data sets to explore a method of pattern recognition using local histograms and neural networks.

Exact calculation of the momentarily inductance of flexible cables and electrode arms can result in improving the control system of EAF and satisfactory study of the effects of EAF on power system. Because of using numerical method, calculation of inductance is a time consuming process and cannot be used to improve the control system of EAF. So an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for a fast estimate of inductance of flexible cables and electrode arms. The ANN is trained using the data obtained by proposed code.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564793","startPage":"001507","endPage":"001512","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564793.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line estimation of inductance of flexible cables and electrode arms in an electric arc furnace by artificial neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductance","Cables","Electrodes","Arm","Furnaces","Artificial neural networks","Control systems","Power system modeling","Fluctuations","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arc furnaces","electrodes","inductance","neurocontrollers","power cables","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-line estimation","flexible cable inductance","electrode arm","electric arc furnace","EAF control system","artificial neural network","ANN","3D numerical method","power system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arc Furnace","Flexible Cable","Electrode Arm","Inductance","Artificial Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"On-line estimation of inductance of flexible cables and electrode arms in an electric arc furnace by artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4564793/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103605","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line estimation of inductance of flexible cables and electrode arms in an electric arc furnace by artificial neural network","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048553S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4564794,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Wireless sensor networks are supposed to have lesser complexity encoders at the expense of higher decoder complexity. Therefore DVC is more suitable to video transmission over wireless sensor networks compared to conventional video coding. Current research work on DVC is conducted for lossless channel, i.e, parity bit stream is not influenced by noise or distortion and further correlation noise due to the residual between input video frame and side information is not estimated effectively. In other words , noisy environment is not analyzed with DVC codec in recent research works. In this paper, DVC codec is enabled with the effect of AWGN noise and further a single wireless fading channel (SISO) is considered. The correlation noise is analyzed for Foreman and Carphone video sequences and relationship of correlation of adjacent key frames are discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564794","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564794.pdf","startPage":"001513","endPage":"001516","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed video coding and transmission over wireless fading channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed video coding and transmission over wireless fading channel","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4564794/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103606","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564794/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed video coding and transmission over wireless fading channel","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042328S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4564799,"authors":[{"name":"Hisham Alasady","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hisham","lastName":"Alasady","id":"37695495500"},{"name":"Mohamed Ibnkahla","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Ibnkahla","id":"37265105800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1643-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4564799","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":513},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Table lookup","Predistortion","Digital signal processing","Satellite communication","Mathematical model","Quantization","High power amplifiers","Nonlinear distortion","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","hardware description languages","mathematics computing","quadrature amplitude modulation","satellite communication","table lookup","telecommunication computing","travelling wave amplifiers","travelling wave tubes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["look-up table predistortion","quadrature amplitude modulation","predistortion technique","satellite communications","Altera DSP board","Altera Stratix DSP EP1S80","VHDL","traveling wave tube amplifier","symbol error rate","Matlab/Simulink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware implementation","nonlinear amplifier","predistortion"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design procedure and implementation results of a 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) look up table (LUT) predistortion technique for satellite communications using Altera DSP board.

This accounts for different techniques of estimating the parameters of the so called channel between the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper beside using a channel model for a typical multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless communication system, we propose a new modified Kalman filter based method for estimating and tracking the channel variations in time. An auto regressive (AR) model is fitted to the channel fluctuations, based on which the forthcoming variations is predicted via a one step predictive Kalman estimation. Then using the recently estimated channel state, the transmitted symbol is estimated via maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, the quantity which is needed by the Kalman estimator for the next one step prediction. In the proposed algorithm the parameters of the Kalman filter is updated at each training instant by defining a cost function which is minimized by a genetic algorithm based numerical method. In our proposed method the periodicity of sending training symbols in order to inform the receiver about the channel state in each transmitting interval is fairly increased. The efficiency of the method for channel matrix estimation is studied through simulation.The results show satisfactory match between the true and the estimated channel.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564860","publicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4554522/4564482/04564860.pdf","startPage":"001823","endPage":"001826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2008.4564860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4564482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new Kalman-ML based channel tracking for correlated mimo fading channels in assistance with G.

Since the proposed SDR does not include any external hardware, its portability is tremendous and upgradation is economical, and the approach can be extended to other communication techniques.

The conventional system model assumes all relay nodes have spontaneous willing to cooperate for data transmission. However, the relay has to consume its own resource (power and bandwidth) for achieving the diversity gain. Thus the usual cooperative assumption is unrealistic for autonomous users. Due to lack of a mechanism to ensure relay\u2019s adherence to the cooperation strategy, the performance improvement may be degraded by selfish relays. In this paper, we investigate the performance of cooperative AF in the presence of multiple selfish users. The relay is assumed to mimic characteristics of an on-off channel where it exhibits random behaviors of cooperation and defection to hide its disposition. We derive the explicit expressions for the average bit error rate (BER) performance of cooperative diversity networks with multiple selfish relays. Our results indicate that multiple selfish relays can improve BER tremendously relative to a single selfish relay, if the multiple relays have proper selfish degree.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4564905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4564905/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10103757","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative amplify and forward in the presence of multiple selfish relays: Performance analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative amplify and forward in the presence of multiple selfish relays: Performance analysis","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-07092008-00423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036267S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4554522","isNumber":"4564482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4554522","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4564482","articleId":"4564905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4564932,"authors":[{"name":"Herwig Rehatschek","affiliation":["Joanneum Research Forschungsgesellschaft GmbH, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Herwig","lastName":"Rehatschek","id":"37353431500"},{"name":"Robert Sorschag","affiliation":["Joanneum Research Forschungsgesellschaft GmbH, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Sorschag","id":"37891780200"},{"name":"Bernhard Rettenbacher","affiliation":["Joanneum Research Forschungsgesellschaft GmbH, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Rettenbacher","id":"38093802300"},{"name":"Herwig Zeiner","affiliation":["Joanneum Research Forschungsgesellschaft GmbH, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Herwig","lastName":"Zeiner","id":"37545879900"},{"name":"Julien Nioche","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Nioche","id":"38093801700"},{"name":"Franciska DeJong","affiliation":["University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Franciska","lastName":"DeJong","id":"38079608200"},{"name":"Roeland Ordelmann","affiliation":["University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Roeland","lastName":"Ordelmann","id":"38093800400"},{"name":"David van Leeuwen","affiliation":["TNO Human Factors Research Institute, Soesterberg, Netherlands"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"van Leeuwen","id":"38228049700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2043-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3983"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3991"}],"articleNumber":"4564932","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"abstract":"MediaCampaignpsilas scope is on discovering and inter-relating advertisements and campaigns, i.e. to relate advertisements semantically belonging together, across different countries and different media.

To facilitate the stability analysis, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear plant. Under the imperfect premise matching in which T-S fuzzy model and fuzzy controller do not share the same membership functions, a fuzzy controller with enhanced design flexibility and robustness property is proposed to control the nonlinear plant. However, the nice characteristic given by the perfect premise matching, leading to conservative stability conditions, vanishes. In this paper, under the imperfect premise matching, information of membership functions of the fuzzy model and controller are considered in stability analysis. With the introduction of slack matrices, relaxed linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based stability conditions are derived using Lyapunov-based approach. Furthermore, LMI-based performance conditions are provided to guarantee system performance.

Based on the idea of delay fractioning, a new method is proposed for the delay-dependent stability analysis of fuzzy time-delay systems. Due to the instrumental idea of delay partitioning, the proposed stability condition is much less conservative than most of the existing results. The conservatism reduction becomes more obvious with the partitioning getting thinner. Based on this, the problem of stabilization via the so-called parallel distributed compensation scheme is also solved. Both the stability and stabilization results are further extended to time-delay fuzzy systems with time-varying parameter uncertainties. All the results are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be readily solved via standard numerical software. The advantage of the results proposed in this paper lies in their reduced conservatism, as shown via detailed illustrative examples. The idea of delay partitioning is well demonstrated to be efficient for conservatism reduction and could be extended to solving other problems related to fuzzy delay systems.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.928598","startPage":"750","endPage":"762","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5175617/04565673.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.928598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and Stabilization of Delayed T--S Fuzzy Systems: A Delay Partitioning Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay systems","Fuzzy systems","Communication system control","Stability analysis","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Space technology","Delay effects","Nonlinear control systems","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","continuous time systems","delays","fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities","stability","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delayed T-S fuzzy system","stabilization","delay partitioning approach","delay-dependent stability analysis","continuous time-delay system","delay fractioning","parallel distributed compensation scheme","time-varying parameter uncertainty","linear matrix inequality","LMI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay partitioning","stability","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T--S) fuzzy systems","time-delay systems","uncertainties"]},{"kwd":["Delay partitioning","Stability","T-S fuzzy systems","Time-delay systems","Uncertainties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4565673/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Stability and Stabilization of Delayed T--S Fuzzy Systems: A Delay Partitioning Approach","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4565673/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10794842","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and Stabilization of Delayed T--S Fuzzy Systems: A Delay Partitioning Approach","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-zhao-928598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101768S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5175617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"248","xplore-issue":"5175617","articleId":"4565673","onlineDate":"16 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4565674,"authors":[{"name":"Shang-Ming Zhou","affiliation":["Centre of Computational Intelligence, Department of Informatics, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4982906/4565674/4565674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shang-Ming Zhou (M'01) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, China, the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Essex, Colchester, U.K.","He is currently with the Centre for Computational Intelligence, Department of Informatics, De Montfort University, Leicester, U.K. His research interests include fuzzy logic systems (type-1 and type-2) and applications, decision support systems under uncertainty environments, model interpretability and transparency in data-driven neurofuzzy systems, kernel machine learning (in support vector machines) with fuzzy computing, artificial neural networks and pattern recognition, and intelligent signal and image processing.

While many techniques have been proposed for creating parsimonious type-1 fuzzy systems, there is a lack of such techniques for type-2 systems. The essential problem is to reduce the number of rules, while maintaining the system's approximation performance. In this paper, four novel indexes for ranking the relative contribution of type-2 fuzzy rules are proposed, which are termed \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>\n-values, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</i>\n-values, omega\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-values, and omega\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-values.

The \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</i>\n-values rank rules based on the effects of rule consequents, while the omega\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-values and omega\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-values consider both the rule-base structure (via firing strength matrices) and the output contribution of fuzzy rule consequents. Two procedures for utilizing these indexes in fuzzy rule selection (termed ldquoforward selectionrdquo and ldquobackward eliminationrdquo) are described. Experiments are presented which demonstrate that by using the proposed methodology, the most influential type-2 fuzzy rules can be effectively retained in order to construct parsimonious type-2 fuzzy models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4565674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4565674/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10667277","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Constructing Parsimonious Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems via Influential Rule Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Constructing Parsimonious Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems via Influential Rule Selection","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-zhou-928597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127582S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4982906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4982906","articleId":"4565674","onlineDate":"16 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4565675,"authors":[{"name":"Thierry Marie Guerra","affiliation":["Laboratoire d Automatique et de M\u00e9canique Industrielles et Humaines, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS 8530, Universite Valenciennes et du Hainaut-Cambr\u00e9sis, Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Thierry Marie","lastName":"Guerra","id":"37266448400"},{"name":"Alexandre Kruszewski","affiliation":["LAGIS UMR CNRS 8146, Ecole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Kruszewski","id":"37398347900"},{"name":"Miguel Bernal","affiliation":["National Research System, Mexicali, Mexico"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Bernal","id":"37400573800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"4565675","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lyapunov method","Linear matrix inequalities","Robust stability","Distributed control","Feedback","State-space methods","Cities and towns","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete systems","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control law proposition","discrete Takagi-Sugeno model","stabilization","discrete nonlinear model","candidate Lyapunov function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear matrix inequalities (LMI)","Lyanupov functional","stabilization","Takagi\u2013Sugeno discrete models"]},{"kwd":["Lyapunov functional","Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI)","Stabilization","Takagi-Sugeno Discrete models"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the stabilization of a class of discrete nonlinear models, namely those in the Takagi-Sugeno form; its main goal is to reduce conservatism of existing stabilization conditions using a special class of candidate Lyapunov functions and an enhanced control law.

We study the ability of the filters to acquire and track a target satellite in geosynchronous orbit as a function of the sample interval, initial uncertainty, and type of available measurements. For target acquisition, SDUKF yields more accurate position and velocity estimates than SDEKF. Moreover, the convergence of SDEKF is sensitive to the initialization of the error covariance; in fact, a nondiagonal initial covariance is found to be more effective than a diagonal initial covariance. Like SDUKF, by properly setting a nondiagonal initial error covariance, SDEKF also exhibits global convergence, that is, convergence is attained for all initial true-anomaly errors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vehicles","Extraterrestrial measurements","State estimation","Nonlinear equations","Filters","Riccati equations","Estimation error","Satellites","Differential equations","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","sampled data filters","space vehicles","state estimation","target tracking","tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear sampled-data state estimation","SDEKF","SDUKF","spacecraft tracking","Kalman filters","LEO satellites","target tracking","geosynchronous orbit","error covariance matrix","convergence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCS.2008.923231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/4566008/04566033.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2008.923231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spacecraft tracking using sampled-data Kalman filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spacecraft tracking using sampled-data Kalman filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566033/","volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4566033/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10115074","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spacecraft tracking using sampled-data Kalman filters","sourcePdf":"24-28msc04-teixeira.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083064S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"4566008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4566008","articleId":"4566033","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4566073,"authors":[{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4802057/4566073/4566073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bor-Sen Chen (M'82\u2013SM'89\u2013F'01) received the B.S. degree from Tatung Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1970, the M.S. degree from the National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, in 1973, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1982.","From 1973 to 1987, he was a Lecturer, an Associate Professor, and a Professor with Tatung Institute of Technology.

The extended Kalman filter is used for nonlinear estimation. The IMM is employed as a switch between the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) states, which are considered to be a Markov process with two interactive modes. Combining extended Kalman filtering with the IMM scheme for accurately smooth range estimation between the corresponding base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) in the rough wireless environment, the proposed robust mobile location estimator, in association with data fusion, can efficiently mitigate the NLOS effects on the measurement range error. Simulation results illustrate that the performance of the proposed method has been significantly improved in the LOS/NLOS transition case. Moreover, the performance of the EK-IMM smoother with data fusion is also better than that with a single measurement used alone.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4566073/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10520121","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Location Estimator in a Rough Wireless Environment Using Extended Kalman-Based IMM and Data Fusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Location Estimator in a Rough Wireless Environment Using Extended Kalman-Based IMM and Data Fusion","sourcePdf":"58tvt03-bchen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067028S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4802057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4802057","articleId":"4566073","onlineDate":"16 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":4566075,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhi Zhao","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hongzhi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290334800"},{"name":"Yi Gong","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888700"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272208800"},{"name":"Youxi Tang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Youxi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37277296700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4566075","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","MIMO","Error probability","Degradation","Block codes","Receiving antennas","Fading","Bit error rate","Phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-PSK","M-QAM modulation","orthogonal space-time block codes","multiple-input-multiple-output communication systems","MIMO","error probability","outage probability","keyhole fading channels","M-ray phase-shift keying","M-ray quadrature amplitude modulation","signal-to-noise ratios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","diversity gain","keyhole","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","symbol error rate (SER)","space\u2013time block code (STBC)"]},{"kwd":["Space-time block code","keyhole","MIMO","bit error rate","symbol error rate","diversity gain"]}],"abstract":"It is known that the keyhole or pinhole effect can severely degrade the performance of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems.

The method can accurately track fast changes in noise power level (up to about 10 dB/s). In each time frame, for each frequency bin, the noise variance estimate is updated recursively with the minimum mean-square error (mmse) estimate of the current noise power. A time- and frequency-dependent smoothing parameter is used, which is varied according to an estimate of speech presence probability. In this way, the amount of speech power leaking into the noise estimates is kept low. For the estimation of the noise power, a spectral gain function is used, which is found by an iterative data-driven training method. The proposed noise tracking method is tested on various stationary and nonstationary noise sources, for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and compared with two state-of-the-art methods. When used in a speech enhancement system, improvements in segmental signal-to-noise ratio of more than 1 dB can be obtained for the most nonstationary noise sources at high noise levels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recursive estimation","Speech enhancement","Signal to noise ratio","Noise level","Frequency estimation","Iterative methods","Estimation error","Discrete Fourier transforms","Statistics","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","acoustic noise measurement","mean square error methods","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonstationary noise tracking","data-driven recursive noise power estimation","noise spectral variance estimation","speech signal","nonstationary noise source","noise power level","minimum mean square error estimate","speech presence probability","speech power","noise estimate","spectral gain function","iterative data-driven training method","speech enhancement","segmental signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based speech enhancement","minimum mean-square error (mmse) estimation","noise spectrum estimation","noise tracking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2001108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4566081/04566085.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2001108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking of Nonstationary Noise Based on Data-Driven Recursive Noise Power Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracking of Nonstationary Noise Based on Data-Driven Recursive Noise Power Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566085/","volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4566085/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10117663","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking of Nonstationary Noise Based on Data-Driven Recursive Noise Power Estimation","sourcePdf":"tasl-erkelens-2001108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17126S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4566081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4566081","articleId":"4566085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4566087,"authors":[{"name":"Uttachai Manmontri","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4566081/4566087/4566087-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Uttachai Manmontri received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2006, all in electrical engineering.","From 1998 to 2001, he was with the Post and Telegraph Department, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Bangkok, Thailand, where he served as a Communications Engineer, and since 2001, he has been with the Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR), Pathumthani, Thailand.

A class of Frobenius norm-based algorithms consisting of the offline/block processing (BP), online processing (OP) algorithms, and their normalized versions is proposed for separating nonstationary and nonwhite signals. The BP and OP algorithms, respectively, suitable for blind separation with offline and online data, are derived by using the nonstationarity and nonwhiteness of signals and the natural gradient method in conjunction with an appropriate penalty term. Associated with almost all algorithms employing a gradient method is a gradient noise problem. We thus develop, from BP and OP, their normalized versions in which the update of an unknown demixing matrix is based on the minimal disturbance principle. We show that the resulting updates are in the same direction as those of the original algorithms but with a scaling factor whose upper bound is unity. Algorithms using the nonstationarity and nonwhiteness properties have been proposed before but, due to the use of logarithms in their derivation, they are not capable of separating signals that are not persistently active and require regularization parameters to mitigate the problem. In this paper, the superior performance of the proposed algorithms to the previously proposed logarithm-based algorithms with and without regularization when separating nonpersistently active source signals is presented through some illustrative numerical experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Class of Frobenius Norm-Based Algorithms Using Penalty Term and Natural Gradient for Blind Signal Separation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2001388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4566081/04566087.pdf","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2001388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Class of Frobenius Norm-Based Algorithms Using Penalty Term and Natural Gradient for Blind Signal Separation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4566087/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10091284","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of Frobenius Norm-Based Algorithms Using Penalty Term and Natural Gradient for Blind Signal Separation","sourcePdf":"16tasl06-pnaylor-2001388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096075S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4566081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4566081","articleId":"4566087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4566108,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Ri Piao","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering & NPT Center, Myongji University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheng-Ri","lastName":"Piao","id":"38098854200"},{"name":"Dong-Min Woo","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering & NPT Center, Myongji University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Min","lastName":"Woo","id":"37403193900"},{"name":"Dong-Chul Park","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering & NPT Center, Myongji University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Chul","lastName":"Park","id":"37275453300"},{"name":"Seung-Soo Han","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering & NPT Center, Myongji University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Soo","lastName":"Han","id":"37694389500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566108","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Authentication","Wavelet transforms","Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Robustness","Image resolution","Forgery","Wavelet domain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","image coding","medical image processing","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image authentication","hash function","integer wavelet transform","fragile watermarking algorithm","forgery problem","security problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medical Image","Authentication","Hash Function","Integer Wavelet Transform"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new fragile watermarking algorithm for medical images is proposed.

In the proposed architecture, four current macrobocks are concurrently compared with a single search window (SW) of the reference frame to find the best matched block.By reusing the SW of the reference frame and scheduling the architecture in pipeline, the proposed architecture can reduce the memory bandwidth and the execution time.

Observing the key components of a spectrum analyzer are the intensities for respective frequencies, we propose a Goertzel algorithm to directly extract the intensity factors for respective frequency components in the input signal. Goertzel algorithm dispenses with the memory for z-1 and z-2 processing, and only needs two multipliers and three adders for real number calculation. In this paper, we present the spectrum extraction algorithm and implement a spectrum extractor with high speed and low area consumption in a FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip. It proves the feasibility of implementing a handheld concurrent multi-channel real-time spectrum analysis IP into a low gate counts and low power consumption CPLD (complex programmable logic device) chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566098/04566139.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"159","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Spectrum Analyzer with High Area Efficiency by Goertzel Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectral analysis","Frequency","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Real time systems","Finite impulse response filter","Band pass filters","Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Local oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","spectral analysers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based spectrum analyzer","Goertzel algorithm","FFT algorithm","software design","parallel hardware system","field programmable gate array","multichannel real-time spectrum analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum Analyzer","Goertzel Algorithm","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Spectrum Analyzer with High Area Efficiency by Goertzel Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4566139/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10076471","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Spectrum Analyzer with High Area Efficiency by Goertzel Algorithm","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119a157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044707S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4566098","articleId":"4566139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4566141,"authors":[{"name":"Jee-Hye Lee","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jee-Hye","lastName":"Lee","id":"37696331600"},{"name":"Myung-Sun Baek","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Sun","lastName":"Baek","id":"37267295900"},{"name":"Hyoung-Kyu Song","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Kyu","lastName":"Song","id":"37270117500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566141","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Quadrature phase shift keying","OFDM","Channel state information","Wireless communication","Error correction","Quality of service","Fading","Bandwidth","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MB-OFDM System","soft decision decoding method","channel state information","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","UWB system","wireless communication","error correction performance","two constellation mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MB-OFDM","Dual Carrier Modulation","CSI","Soft Decision"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the soft decision decoding method using CSI (channel state information) for DCM that is used for high data rate (320, 400, 480 Mbps) in MB-OFDM (multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) system is investigated.

And CSI can be used in the soft-decision process to achieve better error correction performance. Moreover, to decrease the loss in diversity, DCM is proposed instead of QPSK.

At the fifth level of decomposition, S1 and S2 were effectively separated from systolic heart murmurs. A quantitative measure of signal energy was developed and used to determine the boundaries of S1 and S2 sounds and to isolate systolic murmurs.

This scheme is appropriate for wireless sensor network and distributed video coding. In this paper, we address the problem of coding two Gaussian correlated non-binary sources with one of which is only available at the decoder using the non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The proposed approach is based on the extension of the channel coding concept of syndrome. The correlation between the sources is modeled as a virtual additive Gaussian backward channel. The use of non-binary LDPC codes in the proposed system makes coding without converting non-binary sources to binary bits feasible, and thus it overcomes the reduction in correlation caused by conversion. Experiments show that the proposed system achieves a good performance over GF(4) and GF(8), which enables us to reasonably conclude that the considered scheme is extremely suitable for distributed coding of correlated non-binary sources.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.35","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566248/04566299.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566248","startPage":"214","endPage":"218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Coding of Gaussian Correlated Sources Using Non-binary LDPC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Coding of Gaussian Correlated Sources Using Non-binary LDPC","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566299/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4566299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Coding of Gaussian Correlated Sources Using Non-binary LDPC","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119b214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037699S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4566248","articleId":"4566299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4566301,"authors":[{"name":"Decai Zou","firstName":"Decai","lastName":"Zou"},{"name":"Xiaochun Lu","firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Lu"},{"name":"Haitao Wu","firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Jinsong Xu","firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Xu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566301","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Transmitters","Protection","Field programmable gate arrays","Ultra wideband technology","Channel coding","Working environment noise","Master-slave","Synchronization","Indoor environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rate Compatible Punctured Convolutional","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing","Ultra Wide Band","indoor positioning"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Rate Compatible Punctured Convolutional Codes Technique in OFDM-UWB Indoor Positioning System","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566248","endPage":"229","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566248/04566301.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.353","startPage":"225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566301","abstract":"The rate compatible punctured convolutional code (RCPC code) is an important module in Multi-band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Ultra Wide Band (MB-OFDM-UWB) indoor positioning system introduced in this paper as a kind of useful channel coding to offer more protection against all kinds of channel noise under indoor channel environments.

Since a color image can be represented by a quaternion matrix, we can apply our novel QDCT to the field of color template matching. Rather than separating a color image into three channel images and processing them respectively as the traditional methods, QDCT can handle color image pixels as vectors and process them in a holistic manner.

However, the introduction of new techniques in motion estimation also brings about heavy burden of computation complexity on the video coding system. In hardware field, the subsampling technique is widely used to reduce hardware cost and release computation burden of ME engine. However, direct subsampling on video sequences will cause serious quality degradation. This paper proposes a hardware friendly fast ME algorithm which combines two complexity reduction schemes. Firstly, the pixel difference based adaptive subsampling scheme select different subsampling patterns according to the feature of current MB. Secondly, in order to fasten the ME procedure, a search position based 3-layer search range adjustment scheme is proposed to remove redundant search points. Experimental results show that about 74.17% to 90.26% ME Time can be reduced while the video quality loss is trivial. Moreover, since the two schemes are both friendly to hardware implementation, the proposed fast ME algorithm can be implanted into realtime hardwired video coding system.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.186","startPage":"671","endPage":"675","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566248/04566388.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Subsampling and Motion Feature Based Fast H.264 Motion Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Subsampling and Motion Feature Based Fast H.264 Motion Estimation","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4566388/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566388/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Subsampling and Motion Feature Based Fast H.264 Motion Estimation","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119b671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057412S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4566248","articleId":"4566388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4566391,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Jiang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37879296200"},{"name":"Xinyu Chen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278216500"},{"name":"Ping Guo","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Guo","id":"37320676800"},{"name":"Hanqing Lu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hanqing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37274984800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566391","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Linear discriminant analysis","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Pattern recognition","Laboratories","Feature extraction","Scattering","Signal processing","Image sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566391","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566248","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566248/04566391.pdf","startPage":"685","endPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Random Sampling LDA for Face Recognition","abstract":"Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the most used feature extraction techniques for face recognition. However, it often suffers from the small sample size problem with high dimension setting. Random Subspace Method (RSM) is a popular combining technique to improve weak classifier. Nevertheless, it remains a problem how to construct an optimal random subspace for discriminant analysis. In this paper, we propose an improved random sampling LDA for face recognition. Firstly, AdaBoost is adopted to select Gabor feature and remove redundant information. Secondly, in the selected Gabor feature space, we combine principal component analysis and RSM approaches to construct optimal random subspaces for LDA. After that, direct LDA (D-LDA) and R-LDA is applied in each subspace, respectively. Final results are obtained by combining all the LDA classifiers using a fusion rule. Experiments with both the ORL and FERET face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it shows promising results compared with previous approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4566391/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Random Sampling LDA for Face Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Random Sampling LDA for Face Recognition","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119b685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068927S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4566248","articleId":"4566391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4566403,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Hui","affiliation":["Xi''an Institute of Microelectronic Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Hui","id":"37086194403"},{"name":"Shi-tan Huang","affiliation":["Xi''an Institute of Microelectronic Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shi-tan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37856556100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566403","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566403","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Pulse shaping methods","Neural networks","Shape","Image edge detection","Neurons","Computer vision","Surface fitting","Brain modeling","Joining processes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["feature extraction","PCNN","shape information"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.471","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566248/04566403.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","startPage":"743","endPage":"747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Extraction Using Pulse Coupled Neural Network and Shape Information","abstract":"Feature extraction of specified object is an important preprocessing stage in machine vision systems.

Simulation results show that our method\u2019s effectiveness is better than general noise suppression algorithms and has small time consumption, so it is more useful and fits for real-time sonar operating.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566515/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4566515/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sonar Images De-noising Based on Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sonar Images De-noising Based on Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119c403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036991S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","xplore-issue":"4566425","articleId":"4566515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4566543,"authors":[{"name":"Bing-Jian Wang","firstName":"Bing-Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599809200"},{"name":"Da-Bao Wang","firstName":"Da-Bao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087737628"},{"name":"Rui Lai","firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Lai","id":"37590656800"},{"name":"Li-Ping Bai","firstName":"Li-Ping","lastName":"Bai","id":"37087739195"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566543","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566543","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Infrared detectors","Infrared imaging","Etching","Sensor arrays","Noise generators","Algorithm design and analysis","Motion detection","Image edge detection","Convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IRFPA","non-uniformity correction","neural network","adaptive correction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.539","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566425/04566543.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","startPage":"547","endPage":"551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Non-uniformity Correction Algorithm for IRFPA Based on Neural Network","abstract":"Influenced by detector materials' non-uniformity, growth and etching techniques' etc, every detector's responsivity of infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPA) is different, which results in non-uniformity of IRFPA. And non-uniformity of IRFPA generates fixed pattern noises (FPN) that are superposed on infrared images. So the quality of infrared images is poor, which greatly limited the application of IRFPA. And non-uniformity correction (NUC) is an important technique for IRFPA. The traditional non-uniformity correction algorithm based on neural network and its modified algorithms are analyzed in this paper. And a new improved non-uniformity correction algorithm based on neural network is proposed in this paper. In this algorithm, the desired image is estimated by using three successive images in an infrared sequence. And motion blur is avoided by applying implicit motion detection and edge detection. So the estimation image is closer to real image than the estimation image estimated by other algorithms. So convergence speed of correction parameters is much fast. A comparison is made to these algorithms in this paper. And experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper prevails over other algorithms based on neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566543/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4566543/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Improved Non-uniformity Correction Algorithm for IRFPA Based on Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Non-uniformity Correction Algorithm for IRFPA Based on Neural Network","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119c547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047998S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4566425","articleId":"4566543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":4566558,"authors":[{"name":"Nian Cai","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Nian","lastName":"Cai","id":"37584457600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566558","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Gray-scale","Digital images","Statistics","Artificial neural networks","Pixel","Wavelet transforms","Adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet neural network","edge detection","difference features","median features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566558","abstract":"Wavelet neural networks have the advantages of good localization characteristics and adaptive learning virtue.

For the CR network, a fundamental issue is how to identify the spectrum opportunities. To improve the sensing performance, cooperative spectrum sensing has been proposed. With the conventional sensing method, every cognitive user conducts its individual spectrum sensing by comparing the observation with a pre-fixed threshold and then sends a binary local decision to the common receiver. In the paper, we introduce a novel spectrum scheme based on the trustiness factor (TF) and fussy decision. According to the energy detection, if the energy is located in the energy region with TF=1, then the cognitive user sends 1 bit quantization for reporting its sensing result. Otherwise, the cognitive user sends 2 bits quantization. A final decision therefore is made according to the reporting results. Simulation results show that the proposed sensing scheme outperforms the conventional method in terms of missing probability without noticeable loss in quantization performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4566609/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Spectrum Awareness Algorithm for Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Spectrum Awareness Algorithm for Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119d019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047555S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4566597","articleId":"4566609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4566614,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihui Huang","firstName":"Zhihui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37711816800"},{"name":"Shulin Kan","firstName":"Shulin","lastName":"Kan","id":"37720787200"},{"name":"Jing Yuan","firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yuan","id":"38184606200"},{"name":"Yizhou Ren","firstName":"Yizhou","lastName":"Ren","id":"38088265300"},{"name":"Yufeng Wei","firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Wei","id":"38090676400"},{"name":"Qiaoying Dong","firstName":"Qiaoying","lastName":"Dong","id":"37704883900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566614","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Automatic control","Intelligent systems","Feature extraction","Shape","Control system analysis","Control systems","Intelligent networks","Fuzzy control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566614","abstract":"In order to realization electronic parts product appearance quality detection control, one kind of processor based on the intelligent knowledge automatic extraction and system intelligence modeling was presented.

The result of simulation displays that lifting scheme needs less memory requirement.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Finite impulse response filter","Signal processing","Process design","Signal design","Educational institutions","Design engineering","Real time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["lifting wavelet","image processing","FPGA design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566677","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.239","startPage":"362","endPage":"365","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566597/04566677.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566677/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Design of Fast Lifting Wavelet Transform","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","volume":"4","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4566677/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Design of Fast Lifting Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119d362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045191S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4566597","articleId":"4566677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-28"},{"_id":4566681,"authors":[{"name":"Tong-cheng Huang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China","Institute of Laser and Information Technology, Shaoyang University, Shaoyang, China"],"firstName":"Tong-cheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37593772700"},{"name":"You-dong Ding","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"You-dong","lastName":"Ding","id":"37277997000"},{"name":"Li-ping Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Laser and Information Technology, Shaoyang University, Shaoyang, China"],"firstName":"Li-ping","lastName":"Yin","id":"37957464200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566681","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566681","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Handwriting recognition","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Data mining","Image recognition","NIST","Image databases","Spatial databases","System testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-wavelet transform","neural network clusters","handwritten numerical","pattern recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.513","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566597/04566681.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","startPage":"380","endPage":"384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Handwritten Numerals Recognition Based on Multiwavelet Neural Network","abstract":"This paper validates a recognition system via multiwavelet neural network as feature extractor and classifier.

In this paper, a multiple-receiver SAS signal model is obtained in the background of high mapping rate and wide swath.

Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher diversity gain and better bit-error rate (BER) performance compared with the traditional point-to-point MIMO scheme with the same number of transmit and receive antennas and the equal power efficiency and spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.327","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566766/04566783.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Differential Space-Time Transmission Scheme for MIMO Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566783/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Differential Space-Time Transmission Scheme for MIMO Relay Networks","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4566783/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Differential Space-Time Transmission Scheme for MIMO Relay Networks","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119e044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094021S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4566766","articleId":"4566783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4566784,"authors":[{"name":"Jin You Qu","firstName":"Jin You","lastName":"Qu"},{"name":"Jian Yun Zhang","firstName":"Jian Yun","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Xiu Wang","firstName":"Xiu","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Chun Sheng Liu","firstName":"Chun Sheng","lastName":"Liu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566784","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","MIMO","Radar cross section","Radar signal processing","Transmitters","Solid scintillation detectors","Performance analysis","Radar imaging","Signal analysis","Adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","coherent pulses","detection performance"]}],"abstract":"The detection performance of spatial diversity multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar for Swerling I and Swerling II target is analyzed based on coherent pulses.

The experimental result shows the system performs well and is helpful for speech recognition research based on an IP core in an embedded platform.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.273","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566766/04566838.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A HMM Speech Recognition System Based on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566838/","displayDocTitle":"A HMM Speech Recognition System Based on FPGA","isConference":true,"volume":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4566838/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A HMM Speech Recognition System Based on FPGA","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119e305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06382S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4566766","articleId":"4566838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4566839,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen-li Wang","firstName":"Zhen-li","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Zhi-qiang Bai","firstName":"Zhi-qiang","lastName":"Bai"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566839","dbTime":"42 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["1f noise","Noise robustness","Speech recognition","Speech enhancement","Noise reduction","Cepstral analysis","Frequency selective surfaces","Working environment noise","Humans","Background noise"]}],"abstract":"By combining Fractional Spectral Subtraction (FSS) with Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP), a hybrid method of noise robustness speech recognition isinvestigated in this paper.

The proposed method is based on eigen-analysis of DS-CDMA signals, and exploits the cyclo-stationarity of communication signals adequately. The received signal is firstly sampled and divided into non-overlapping signal vectors according to a temporal window, which duration is a period of pseudo noise (PN) sequence (signature waveform). Then an autocorrelation matrix is computed and accumulated by these signal vectors one by one. Since the synchronous point between the symbol waveform and observation window is a randomize determination point, therefore, each vector must contain all information of a whole period of PN sequence. In the end, the PN sequence and its strength can be extracted by the principal eigenvectors and their associated eigenvalues of autocorrelation matrix blindly. But, the eigen-analysis method is belongs to a batch method, it is difficult to real-time implementation. We can use the LEAP NN method to realize on-line adaptive principal feature extraction and tracking of the weak input DS-CDMA signals effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566766/04566854.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"389","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Method to Adaptive Feature Extraction of Weak DS-CDMA Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Adaptive systems","Feature extraction","Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Autocorrelation","Unsupervised learning","Principal component analysis","Data mining","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Method to Adaptive Feature Extraction of Weak DS-CDMA Signals","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4566854/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Method to Adaptive Feature Extraction of Weak DS-CDMA Signals","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119e385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046835S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","xplore-issue":"4566766","articleId":"4566854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4566857,"authors":[{"name":"Haining Fan","firstName":"Haining","lastName":"Fan"},{"name":"Ying Guo","firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Yaohua Xu","firstName":"Yaohua","lastName":"Xu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566857","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Autocorrelation","Signal processing algorithms","Signal detection","Detection algorithms","Signal processing","Power engineering and energy","Testing","Signal analysis","Radio communication countermeasures"]}],"abstract":"An algorithm to blindly detect frequency hopping (FH) signals corrupted by white Gaussian noise (WGN) is presented.

The propagation of light wave in atmospheric turbulence was studied, and the received signal was modeled. Then the optimum decision threshold model was derived for FSO communication links using intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD). The turbulence-induced signal fluctuation, i.e. scintillation noise, was modeled as multiplicative noise in the received signal. In order to mitigate the scintillation noise, an adaptive Kalman filter was used to predict the value of received signal and turbulence statistics. Based on the Kalman filter, the detection with adaptive decision threshold was realized. Finally, the performance of Kalman filter was calculated, and the results show the error between optimum decision threshold and adaptive decision threshold is smaller than 0.48%.

The performance of LSB-DWT scheme is validated against simulated frequency and geometric attacks, specifically JPG compression, low pass filtering, median filtering, noise addition, scaling, rotation and cropping through visual inspection, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and watermark distortion rate. Experiment results prove that LSB-DWT scheme is sufficiently robust even in the presence of deliberate distortions.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.713","publicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566097/4566766/04566919.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2008.713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of LSB and DWT Biometric Watermarking for Offline Handwritten Signature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566919/","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of LSB and DWT Biometric Watermarking for Offline Handwritten Signature","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4566919/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of LSB and DWT Biometric Watermarking for Offline Handwritten Signature","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119e702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072416S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4566766","articleId":"4566919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4566927,"authors":[{"name":"Ka-Fai Cedric Yiu","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ka-Fai Cedric","lastName":"Yiu","id":"38181160400"},{"name":"Yao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Lu","id":"38090144800"},{"name":"Xiaoxiang Shi","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiang","lastName":"Shi","id":"38085019800"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3119-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566927","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Acceleration of a Subband Beamforming Algorithm for Speech Enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566927","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Array signal processing","Speech enhancement","Signal processing algorithms","Finite impulse response filter","Frequency domain analysis","Microphone arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Nonlinear filters"]}],"abstract":"Signal processing methods for speech enhancement are of vital interest for many equipment.

The aim of the paper is to study the impact of the different types of subband filter banks on the speech enhancement performance. Results show that the octave band filter banks provide an effective means to give an overall efficient processing by using a fewer free filter parameters while providing a similar performance in terms of Signal to Noise Interference Ratio(SNIR) as compared to the uniform case. Whilst the critical band filter bank uses the most subbands, it provides the best performance both objectively and subjectively. This study provides insight to the design of filter bank for future hardware implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4566928/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-uniform Optimal Subband Beamforming: An Evaluation on Real Acoustic Measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-uniform Optimal Subband Beamforming: An Evaluation on Real Acoustic Measurements","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3119e747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051216S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4566097","isNumber":"4566766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566097","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4566766","articleId":"4566928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4566946,"authors":[{"name":"Assel Akzhalova","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Assel","lastName":"Akzhalova","id":"38096875100"},{"name":"Nurzhan Duzbayev","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Nurzhan","lastName":"Duzbayev","id":"38096875200"},{"name":"Iman Poernomo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Poernomo","id":"37266993000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4566946","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4566946","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Optimal control","Control theory","Automatic control","Runtime","Communication system control","Autoregressive processes","Queueing analysis","Context modeling","Model driven engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control theory","moving average processes","quality of service","queueing theory","regression analysis","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven control","self-adaptive systems","quality of service models","control theory","queued systems","regressive integrated moving average techniques","context-based interception"]}],"abstract":"Self-adaptive systems are capable of changing their behaviour at runtime to meet target constraints. An important research question is how quality of service models can inform runtime adaptation. We sketch one solution to this question by application of control theory to improve performance of queued systems by means of architectural adaptation. Previous research by our group has shown how Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average techniques can be utilized to forecast how Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics are likely to evolve in the near future. This is particularly important in cases where systems can be adapted to counter QoS constraint violations. In this paper, we show how, given a similar type of QoS characteristic forecasts, strategies of architectural adaptation can be implemented that pre-emptively avoid QoS violations. The novelty of our approach is that we use classical control theory to ensure that our adaptation strategies are stable, in the sense that they do not oscillate between choices. We provide a description of how our control theoretic model can be implemented using context-based interception in .NET via model driven engineering.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4566945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDOCW.2007.18","publicationTitle":"2007 Eleventh International IEEE EDOC Conference Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Eleventh International IEEE EDOC Conference Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4566944/4566945/04566946.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doi":"10.1109/EDOCW.2007.18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Driven Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Model Driven Control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4566946/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10160234","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4566946/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Driven Control","confLoc":"Annapolis, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"33380001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064007S","chronDate":"15-16 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4566944","isNumber":"4566945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4566944","xplore-issue":"4566945","articleId":"4566946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4567057,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Richter","affiliation":["Potsdam University, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Richter","id":"37997728100"},{"name":"Klaus Oberlaender","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies AG, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Oberlaender","id":"37085922225"},{"name":"Michael Goessel","affiliation":["Potsdam University, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Goessel","id":"37330129700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3264-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"4567057","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":894},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Protection","Decoding","Computer errors","Single event upset","Testing","Optimal control","Event detection","Hardware","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error detection codes","Hamming codes","linear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear SEC-DED codes","triple bit error miscorrection probability","single-error-correcting codes","double-error-detecting codes","odd-weight column codes","Hamming codes","double bit error correction capabilities","non-adjacent double bit errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SEC-DED codes","SEC-DED-DAEC codes","triple bit error miscorrection","Hsiao code"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2008.27","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2008.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567041","publicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567040/4567041/04567057.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Linear SEC-DED Codes with Reduced Triple Bit Error Miscorrection Probability","abstract":"This paper solves the problem of minimizing triple bit error miscorrection for single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting codes (SEC-DED codes) which are used to protect all kinds of memory against errors. A lower bound for triple bit error miscorrection for the widely used class of odd-weight column codes is derived and actual codes which are very close to that theoretical bound are presented. Surprisingly, significantly better results are obtained with shortened generalized Hamming codes. An optimal (39,32)-SEC-DED code with 32 information bits and 7 control bits is determined which has the lowest risk of triple bit miscorrection of any possible linear (39,32)-code. It is shown how codes with 64 and 128 information bits with significantly lower triple bit miscorrection probability than currently used codes can be derived from that code.The new codes also feature adjacent double bit error correction capabilities (SEC-DED-DAEC codes). Employing them in a SEC-DED-DAEC checker reduces the risk of miscorrecting non-adjacent double bit errors by 27-34% compared to the best codes known.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10076657","htmlLink":"/document/4567057/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Linear SEC-DED Codes with Reduced Triple Bit Error Miscorrection Probability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Linear SEC-DED Codes with Reduced Triple Bit Error Miscorrection Probability","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"3264a037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055927S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567040","isNumber":"4567041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567040","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4567041","articleId":"4567057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4567060,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Roche","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics Private Limited, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Roche","id":"37281997800"},{"name":"Mark Lysinger","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics Private Limited, Carrollton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Lysinger","id":"38094568600"},{"name":"Gilles Gasiot","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics Private Limited, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Gasiot","id":"37267707600"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Daveau","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics Private Limited, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Daveau","id":"37348592600"},{"name":"Mehdi Zamanian","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics Private Limited, Carrollton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Zamanian","id":"37375422700"},{"name":"Pierre Dautriche","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics Private Limited, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Dautriche","id":"37296809500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3264-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"4567060","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Space technology","Medical services","Biomedical equipment","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","CMOS memory circuits","radiation hardening (electronics)","space vehicle electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced commercial CMOS technologies","space applications","medical applications","radiation-hardened SRAM","CMOS technology","intrinsic radiation robustness","radiation-hardness","size 130 nm","storage capacity 8 Mbit"]}],"abstract":"This paper reviews recent experimental confirmations that the intrinsic radiation robustness of commercial CMOS technologies naturally improves with the down-scaling.

The current checking is performed on an H-tree SRAM in different ways.

It avoids the use of a trivial triple modular redundancy (TMR) to protect the blocks that performs the final stages of the RNS based FIR computation.","publicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567040/4567041/04567092.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Totally Fault Tolerant RNS Based FIR Filters","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2008.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2008.14","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Totally Fault Tolerant RNS Based FIR Filters","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10076687","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567092/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Totally Fault Tolerant RNS Based FIR Filters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"3264a192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074944S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567040","isNumber":"4567041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567040","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4567041","articleId":"4567092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4567097,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403479500"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3264-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"4567097","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Circuit testing","System testing","Built-in self-test","Circuit faults","Pulse circuits","Sequences","Calibration","Electrical fault detection","Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","integrated circuit testing","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online testing","microfluidic lab-on-chip devices","digital microfluidic compactors","fluidic abnormalities","bioassay malfunctions","capacitive sensors","built-in self-test method","droplet-based AND gates","dynamic reconfiguration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["on-line testing","digital microfluidic","compactor"]}],"abstract":"Dependability is an important system attribute for microfluidic lab-on-chip devices. On-line testing offers a promising method for detecting defects, fluidic abnormalities, and bioassay malfunctions during chip operation. However, previous techniques for reading test outcomes and analyzing pulse sequences are cumbersome, sensitive to the calibration of capacitive sensors, and error-prone. We present a built-in self-test (BIST) method for on-line testing of digital microfluidic lab-on-chip. This method utilizes microfluidic compactors based on droplet-based AND gates, which are implemented using digital microfluidics. Dynamic reconfiguration of these compactors ensures low area overhead and it allows BIST to be interleaved with bioassays in functional mode.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Line Testing of Lab-on-Chip Using Digital Microfluidic Compactors","publicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2008.45","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567040/4567041/04567097.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2008.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On-Line Testing of Lab-on-Chip Using Digital Microfluidic Compactors","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567097/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10076692","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Line Testing of Lab-on-Chip Using Digital Microfluidic Compactors","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"3264a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063604S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567040","isNumber":"4567041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567040","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4567041","articleId":"4567097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567098,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Zajac","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer ScienceTechnical, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland","Laboratoire d'Analyse et d'Architecture des syst\u00e8mesduCNRS, Universite de Toulouse, UPS, France"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Zajac","id":"37680179200"},{"name":"Jacques H.

To maintain the production yield at acceptable level, several levels of protection mechanisms will have to be implemented to tolerate the permanent and transient faults occurring in the physical layers. In this paper, we study fault tolerance at the architectural level in multiport processor grids (MPG) through core dual diagnosis and self-configuration of communications. MPGs are considered to ensure the scalability of future hundred-core chips. We characterize defective technologies by the IOP reachability (i.e., the ability of the IOPs to contact a fraction of cores in the grid) that we study as a function of the fraction of defective cores or links. We show that almost all valid cores in the grid are accessible by all input-output ports (IOP) up to approximately 20-25% of defective cores. This property is quasi-independent of the position of the IOPs in the grid.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567040/4567041/04567098.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"224","publicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2008.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2008.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Configuration and Reachability Metrics in Massively Defective Multiport Chips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Fault diagnosis","Production","Scalability","Ultra large scale integration","Fault tolerance","Automatic testing","Marine vehicles","Nanobioscience","Biological tissues"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault simulation","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit testing","integrated circuit yield","nanotechnology","ULSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-configuration","reachability metrics","massively defective multiport chips","transistor dimensions","nanotechnologies","complex ULSI chips","production yield","protection mechanisms","permanent faults","transient faults","physical layers","fault tolerance","multiport processor grids","core dual diagnosis","IOP reachability","ultra-large scale integration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Self-Configuration and Reachability Metrics in Massively Defective Multiport Chips","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567098/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10076693","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Configuration and Reachability Metrics in Massively Defective Multiport Chips","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"3264a219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093265S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567040","isNumber":"4567041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567040","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4567041","articleId":"4567098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4567101,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Mudassar Nisar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Muhammad Mudassar","lastName":"Nisar","id":"37398423100"},{"name":"Abhijit Chatterjee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37273696200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3264-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"4567101","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Voltage","Circuits","Digital signal processing","Baseband","Decoding","Communication channels","Performance loss","Arithmetic","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","error compensation","low-power electronics","probability","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guided probabilistic checksums","error control","low power digital-filter","digital signal processing","image processing","voice processing","baseband symbol decoding","high quality communication channels","SNR loss","power optimization","voltage overscaling","arithmetic circuitry","checksum codes","error compensation","PID controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Checksums","Guided Compensation","Low Power","Digital Filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567101","abstract":"In many DSP applications (image and voice processing, baseband symbol decoding in high quality communication channels) several dBs of SNR loss can be tolerated without noticeable impact on system level performance. For power optimization in such applications, voltage overscaling can be used to operate the arithmetic circuitry slower than the critical circuit path delay while incurring tolerable SNR loss due to the resulting periodic errors in computation. In this paper, the use of checksum codes along with low precision shadow latches for compensating errors induced by voltage overscaling in digital filters is investigated. A PID controller is used for voltage overscaling while keeping the error rate in the system within acceptable range. It is shown that significant power savings can be achieved by the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2008.50","publicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567040/4567041/04567101.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2008.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guided Probabilistic Checksums for Error Control in Low Power Digital-Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Guided Probabilistic Checksums for Error Control in Low Power Digital-Filters","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10076696","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567101/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567101/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guided Probabilistic Checksums for Error Control in Low Power Digital-Filters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"3264a239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108174S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567040","isNumber":"4567041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567040","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4567041","articleId":"4567101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4567103,"authors":[{"name":"Damien Leroy","affiliation":["IRoC Technologies SA, France"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Leroy","id":"37979061100"},{"name":"R\u00e9mi Gaillard","affiliation":["IRoC Technologies SA, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Gaillard","id":"37266972800"},{"name":"Erwin Schaefer","affiliation":["IRoC Technologies SA, France"],"firstName":"Erwin","lastName":"Schaefer","id":"37991793000"},{"name":"Cyrille Beltrando","affiliation":["IRoC Technologies SA, France"],"firstName":"Cyrille","lastName":"Beltrando","id":"37991013800"},{"name":"Shi-Jie Wen","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc."],"firstName":"Shi-Jie","lastName":"Wen","id":"37289738200"},{"name":"Richard Wong","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc."],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Wong","id":"37545680600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3264-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"4567103","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Error analysis","Integrated circuit technology","Alpha particles","Performance evaluation","System testing","Integrated circuit modeling","Shape","Semiconductor device manufacture","Integrated circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM alpha-induced soft error rate","alpha particles","SRAM memories","iRoC technologies","size 180 nm to 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","SER","alpha","variation","technology node"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567103","abstract":"This document presents a compilation of results from tests performed by iRoC Technologies on SER induced by alpha particles on SRAM memories for technology nodes from 180 nm to 65 nm.

The spectrum sensing algorithm developed in this study makes use of the property that the bandwidth of the WM signal is narrow compared with the bandwidth of a digital television (DTV) channel. As a result, the power of the WM signal is highly concentrated in the frequency domain and there are apparent peaks contained in the power spectrum density (PSD) of the WM signal even when the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) is as low as -20 dB. Based on this property, a simple spectrum sensing algorithm for the WM signal is evaluated using the maximum peak of the estimated PSD as the decision statistic. The probability of false alarm (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FA</sub>\n) for the proposed WM detector is analytically derived.

In each slot, the users with new traffic demand will sense the spectrum and locate the available subcarrier set. Then they choose subcarriers with favorable channel condition individually while avoid introducing harmful interference to the existing users. Given the delay requirement, an adaptive modulation strategy is proposed for each individual user to minimize the energy consumption per bit over the available subcarrier set by selecting the optimal constellation size. The optimal solution of energy efficient adaptive modulation is derived by using Dinkelback- type algorithm, and a sub-gradient search algorithm is proposed to locate the optimal constellation size. Furthermore, a sub- optimal constant bit allocation strategy is presented to address the delay constraints and a distributed power control is performed to manage the co-channel interference among new users when needed.

approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCNW.2008.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567113","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Annual

In this paper, we design and implement a cognitive wireless network system based on open documents of IEEE P1900.4, and evaluate its performance using UDP streaming and HTTP download. Our experiments show interesting results that total network throughput in the HDP streaming is improved by 30% although some of individual terminals can not necessarily obtain better throughput. Also, it is shown that performance in the HTTP download becomes worse by up to about 40% as the number of handover increases due to the TCP window control. Our analysis is expected to point out importance of higher layer coordination with lower layers for end-to-end performance improvements in cognitive wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567124/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10076709","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567124/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"16-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Cognitive Wireless Network based on IEEE P1900.4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Cognitive Wireless Network based on IEEE P1900.4","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID636800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054666S","chronDate":"16-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567112","isNumber":"4567113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567112","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4567113","articleId":"4567124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4567125,"authors":[{"name":"Keqin Liu","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37404374000"},{"name":"Qing Zhao","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277327400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2563-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2562-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"4567125","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":397},"abstract":"We focus on an opportunistic communication system consisting of multiple independent channels with time-varying states.

Exploiting the underlying structure of the multi-channel opportunistic access problem, we establish the indexability and obtain the Whittle's index in closed-form, which leads to a direct implementation of Whittle's index policy with little complexity. Furthermore, we show that Whittle's index policy is equivalent to the myopic policy when channels are statistically identical.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Annual Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567112/4567113/04567125.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Annual Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks Workshops","doi":"10.1109/SAHCNW.2008.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCNW.2008.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Restless Bandit Formulation of Opportunistic Access: Indexablity and Index Policy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arm","Time varying systems","History","Cognitive radio","Fading","Jamming","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restless bandit formulation","indexability-index policy","multiple independent channels","time-varying states","optimal sequential channel probing","multiarmed bandit process","myopic policy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Restless Bandit Formulation of Opportunistic Access: Indexablity and Index Policy","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567125/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076710","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"16-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Restless Bandit Formulation of Opportunistic Access: Indexablity and Index Policy","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID636341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064662S","chronDate":"16-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567112","isNumber":"4567113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567112","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4567113","articleId":"4567125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4567127,"authors":[{"name":"Si Chen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Si","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403393000"},{"name":"Alexander M.

Given the lack of a centralized intelligence to control the operating parameters of all the wireless devices in a distributed network, the proposed approach employs cross-layer optimization of individual wireless devices using partial operating parameter and environmental information from adjacent devices. Given that all wireless links employ non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) and assuming stationary nodes, the proposed distributed optimization approach will attempt to minimize bit error rate (BER), minimize out-of-band (OOB) interference, maximize overall throughput, and minimize power consumption using a multi-objective fitness function derived in this work.

Here, we consider stochastically varying packet traffic and compare the stable operation under plain routing, and digital and analog network coding. For each scheme, we specify the queue dynamics at the terminal and relay nodes, and evaluate the maximum throughput region optimized over all transmission schedules. We then give throughput optimal policies, which involve maximizing an appropriate differential backlog for each scheme. The analysis leads to the extension of the classical backpressure algorithms for plain routing to digital and analog network coding. Any achievable rates in the maximum throughput region can be stabilized by dynamic scheduling such that the average queue lengths are asymptotically bounded.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Optimal Control for Relay-Assisted Wireless Broadcast with Network Coding","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Annual Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks Workshops","doi":"10.1109/SAHCNW.2008.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Annual Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567112/4567113/04567135.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCNW.2008.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Optimal Control for Relay-Assisted Wireless Broadcast with Network Coding","conferenceDate":"16-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567135/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076720","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Optimal Control for Relay-Assisted Wireless Broadcast with Network Coding","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID637336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078554S","chronDate":"16-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567112","isNumber":"4567113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567112","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4567113","articleId":"4567135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-10"},{"_id":4567140,"authors":[{"name":"Maximilien Gadouleau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Maximilien","lastName":"Gadouleau","id":"37295762500"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37274912700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2563-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2562-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"4567140","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"abstract":"Constant-dimension codes have recently received attention due to their significance to error control in noncoherent random network coding. What the maximal cardinality of any constant-dimension code with finite dimension and minimum distance is and how to construct the optimal constant-dimension code (or codes) that achieves the maximal cardinality both remain open research problems. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to solving these two problems. We first establish a connection between constant-rank codes and constant-dimension codes. Via this connection, we show that optimal constant- dimension codes correspond to optimal constant-rank codes over sufficiently large extension fields. Finally, we derive bounds on the maximum cardinality of a constant-rank code with a given minimum rank distance, propose explicit constructions of optimal or asymptotically optimal constant-rank codes, and establish asymptotic bounds on the maximum rate of a constant-rank code.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Error correction","Code standards","Electronic mail","Network topology","Transmitters","Communication systems","Galois fields","Upper bound","Hamming weight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant-rank codes","constant-dimension codes","noncoherent random network coding","maximum cardinality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SAHCNW.2008.27","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Annual Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Annual Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567112/4567113/04567140.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCNW.2008.27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant-Rank Codes and Their Connection to Constant-Dimension Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constant-Rank Codes and Their Connection to Constant-Dimension Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567140/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567140/","accessionNumber":"10076725","conferenceDate":"16-20 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant-Rank Codes and Their Connection to Constant-Dimension Codes","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID637349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101692S","chronDate":"16-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4567112","isNumber":"4567113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567112","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4567113","articleId":"4567140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4567146,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and ComputerEngineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaoyu Wang (S'03) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.

The maximum power transfer capability of a distributed generator (DG) is analyzed. Sensitivity studies are conducted for DGs equipped with the Sandia frequency shift anti-islanding scheme. Factors such as positive-feedback gain, initial chopping fraction, local load level, and network line impedance are investigated. The maximum power transfer limit versus positive-feedback gain curve is proposed as an index for the stability analysis. The results show that the positive-feedback anti-islanding scheme does have the potential to destabilize the grid-connected DG system when the grid is weak or the DG size is large. A curve that relates the maximum stable DG power transfer level versus the islanding detection time is proposed to quantify the destabilizing effect of the positive-feedback-based anti-islanding schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2008.926066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4603059/04567146.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.926066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Positive-Feedback Anti-Islanding Methods on Small-Signal Stability of Inverter-Based Distributed Generation","volume":"23","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567146/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177416","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567146/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Positive-Feedback Anti-Islanding Methods on Small-Signal Stability of Inverter-Based Distributed Generation","sourcePdf":"23tec03-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055909S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4603059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4603059","articleId":"4567146","onlineDate":"16 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4567147,"authors":[{"name":"Bum-Joo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bum-Joo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293394100"},{"name":"Daniel Stonier","affiliation":["Yujin Robot, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Stonier","id":"37689805200"},{"name":"Yong-Duk Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Duk","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280921000"},{"name":"Jeong-Ki Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Ki","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37292166900"},{"name":"Jong-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281186400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"4567147","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":829},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Humanoid robots","Navigation","Intelligent robots","Trajectory","Foot","Dynamic range","Computer simulation","Laboratories","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanoid robots","mobile robots","nonlinear control systems","pendulums","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modifiable walking pattern","humanoid robot","allowable ZMP variation","complex navigational commands","walking period","step length","sagittal planes","lateral planes","zero moment point","convex hull","foot polygon","3D linear inverted pendulum mode","closed-form function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D linear inverted pendulum mode (3D-LIPM)","feasible region","humanoid robot","modifiable walking pattern","walking state","zeromoment point (ZMP) function","ZMP variation"]},{"kwd":["3-D linear inverted pendulum mode (3D-LIPM)","feasible region","humanoid robot","modifiable walking pattern","walking state"," point (ZMP) function","ZMP variation"]}],"abstract":"In order to handle complex navigational commands, this paper proposes a novel algorithm that can modify a walking period and a step length in both sagittal and lateral planes. By allowing a variation of zero moment point (ZMP) over the convex hull of foot polygon, it is possible to change the center of mass (CM) position and velocity independently throughout the single support phase. This permits a range of dynamic walking motion, which is not achievable using the 3-D linear inverted pendulum mode (3D-LIPM). In addition, the proposed algorithm enables to determine the dynamic feasibility of desired motion via the construction of feasible region, which is explicitly computed from the current CM state with simple ZMP functions. Moreover, adopting the closed-form functions makes it possible to calculate the algorithm in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through both computer simulation and experiment on the humanoid robot, HanSaRam-VII, developed at the Robot Intelligence Technology (RIT) laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.926859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4598893/04567147.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.926859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598893","startPage":"917","endPage":"925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modifiable Walking Pattern of a Humanoid Robot by Using Allowable ZMP Variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modifiable Walking Pattern of a Humanoid Robot by Using Allowable ZMP Variation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144721","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567147/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modifiable Walking Pattern of a Humanoid Robot by Using Allowable ZMP Variation","sourcePdf":"24tro04-lee-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09227S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4598893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4598893","articleId":"4567147","onlineDate":"16 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4567188,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Tak Zhang","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Tak","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37336068500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"4567188","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":885},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational intelligence","Competitive intelligence","Machine learning","Learning systems","Computer architecture","Humans","Assembly","Chemical processes","Motion pictures","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive systems","evolutionary computation","graph theory","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypernetwork model","molecular evolutionary architecture","cognitive learning","computational intelligence","human-level machine learning","random hypergraph structure","higher-order probabilistic relations","evolutionary self-organizing process","molecular self-assembly","chemically-based massive interaction","linguistic recall memory","visual imagery","language-vision crossmodal translation","multimodal memory game environment","hyperinteractionistic molecular mind approach"]}],"abstract":"Recent interest in human-level intelligence suggests a rethink of the role of machine learning in computational intelligence.

Hypernetworks are a random hypergraph structure higher-order probabilistic relations of data by an evolutionary self-organizing process based on molecular self- assembly. The chemically-based massive interaction for information organization and processing in the molecular hypernetworks, referred to as hyperinteractionism, is contrasted \"with the symbolist, connectionist, and dynamicist approaches to mind and intelligence.

The conventional 8T SRAM has the least transistor count, and is the most area efficient. However, the readout power becomes large and the cycle time increases due to peripheral circuits. The 10T single-end SRAM is our proposed SRAM, in which a dedicated inverter and transmission gate are appended as a single-end read port. The readout power of the 10T single-end SRAM is reduced by 75% and the operating frequency is increased by 95%, over the 8T SRAM. On the other hand the 10T differential SRAM can operate fastest, because its small differential voltage of 50 mV achieves the high-speed operation. In terms of the power efficiency, however, the sense amplifier and precharge circuits lead to the power overhead. As a result, the 10T single-end SRAM always consumes lowest readout power compared to the 8T and the 10T differential SRAM.","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2008.4567245","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology and Tutorial","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology and Tutorial","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558851/4567221/04567245.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICDT.2008.4567245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Which is the best dual-port SRAM in 45-nm process technology? \u2014 8T, 10T single end, and 10T differential \u2014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Which is the best dual-port SRAM in 45-nm process technology? \u2014 8T, 10T single end, and 10T differential \u2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076401","htmlLink":"/document/4567245/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Which is the best dual-port SRAM in 45-nm process technology? \u2014 8T, 10T single end, and 10T differential \u2014","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"SPI-07102008-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054634S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558851","isNumber":"4567221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558851","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4567221","articleId":"4567245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4567246,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Experimental IC results, using commercial 0.13 mum CMOS technology, verified the theoretical results: the efficiency is above 90%, THD is lower than 0.01% and PSRR is superior to 70 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567259/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076415","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An integrated class D audio amplifier based on sliding mode control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated class D audio amplifier based on sliding mode control","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"SPI-07102008-00038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052359S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558851","isNumber":"4567221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558851","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4567221","articleId":"4567259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4567260,"authors":[{"name":"Jose-Angel Diaz-Madrid","affiliation":["IC Design Department of the Fraunhofer, Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jose-Angel","lastName":"Diaz-Madrid","id":"38275793000"},{"name":"Harald Neubauer","affiliation":["IC Design Department of the Fraunhofer, Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Neubauer","id":"37396525900"},{"name":"Gines Domenech-Asensi","affiliation":["Departamento de Electronica y Tecnologia de Computadoras, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Gines","lastName":"Domenech-Asensi","id":"38270892100"},{"name":"Ramon Ruiz","affiliation":["Departamento de Electronica y Tecnologia de Computadoras, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Ruiz","id":"37325541000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1810-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1811-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2381-3555"}],"articleNumber":"4567260","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Topology","Pipelines","CMOS technology","Analog-digital conversion","Transient analysis","Analytical models","Power supplies","Capacitors","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","network topology","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifier topologies","pipeline analog to digital converter","CMOS technology","power dissipation","analog multiplexers","gain boosting","size 0.35 mum","voltage 3.3 TV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ADC","pipeline","CMOS","operational amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567260","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2008.4567260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICDT.2008.4567260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567221","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology and Tutorial","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology and Tutorial","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558851/4567221/04567260.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative analysis of two operational amplifier topologies for a 40MS/s 12-bit pipelined ADC in 0.35\u03bcm CMOS","abstract":"This paper describes a comparative analysis between two topologies of operational amplifiers to design a 40 MS/s 12-bit pipeline analog to digital converter (ADC).

However, application of such methods result into reduced stability of the SRAM bitcell. Moreover, reducing supply voltage and increasing process variation put a limitation on such usage in deep submicron processes. Present scheme describes a method to enhance stability while applying such data retention power gating to SRAM memory core. Method improves stability under cross-corner/high-leakage conditions using a feedback mechanism. Minimum functional voltage under data retention power gating is reduced up to 11% of VDD using the described scheme, while using 90 nm CMOS process. The scheme enables the memory usage under low voltage operation, where we observe data retention failures using normal gating methods.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology and Tutorial","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology and Tutorial","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558851/4567221/04567264.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sleep circuit for SRAM core with improved noise-margin","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2008.4567264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICDT.2008.4567264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sleep circuit for SRAM core with improved noise-margin","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076420","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567264/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sleep circuit for SRAM core with improved noise-margin","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"SPI-07102008-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087848S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558851","isNumber":"4567221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558851","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4567221","articleId":"4567264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567270,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Joon Kim","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

For this purpose, the STAP (space-time adaptive processing) is implemented in both arrays with equal elements. Simulation results show that when the pattern of the ESPAR antenna in not formed, the conventional arrays have about 4.5 dB better performances in their cost function. However, by forming the pattern of the ESPAR, its cost function is comparable or even better than the linear and circular arrays. Since the ESPAR antenna has only one active element, its implementation cost is very low in comparison with the linear and circular arrays whose all elements are active. Therefore, the ESPAR can be a frugal replacement for conventional arrays with the same performance.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567310","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time adaptive processing in ESPAR antenna and adaptive arrays in CDMA systems; A comparison","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-time adaptive processing in ESPAR antenna and adaptive arrays in CDMA systems; A comparison","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567310/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076299","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567310/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time adaptive processing in ESPAR antenna and adaptive arrays in CDMA systems; A comparison","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.16523S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-09"},{"_id":4567313,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Each sensor has its own communication capability as well as certain level of intelligence for signal processing and networking. As the sensor nodes are densely populated, communication range requirement for these nodes is smaller. After signal detection, a number of sensor nodes communicate over the same wireless multiuser channel. This necessitates the use of orthogonal codes with good cross correlation properties to mitigate multi access interference (MAI). In sensor networks, due to the dense placement of nodes, limited availability of power brings different metrics for optimality where short length spreading codes might be utilized for coding purposes. In this paper, a design methodology for the generation of such short length varying power orthogonal code sets with multiple levels of chip values is presented. BER characteristics of these short length codes are presented for two user and multiuser scenarios in AWG noise environment. As dynamic utilization of spreading code libraries consisting of multiple orthogonal sets brings additional network security at the code level, we expect spreading code rich system solutions in the future.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567316","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567316.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short length CDMA codes for wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Short length CDMA codes for wireless sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567316/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076304","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567316/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short length CDMA codes for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055006S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4567323,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Cotae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Cotae","id":"37274573000"},{"name":"Madhusudhan Reddy Musku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Madhusudhan Reddy","lastName":"Musku","id":"37563642900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2483-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4567323","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Transmitters","Correlation","Interference","Covariance matrix","Channel state information","Multipath channels","Colored noise","Code division multiplexing","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","correlation methods","gradient methods","matrix algebra","minimisation","multipath channels","telecommunication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["total generalized squared correlation minimization","synchronous DS-CDMA","uplink synchronous code division multiple access","Gram matrix","signature sequences set","multipath channel state information","colored noise","total weighted squared correlation","modified alternating projection method","gradient flow method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["total squared correlation (TSC)","total weighted square correlation (TWSC)","Welch Bound Equality (WBE) sequences","CDMA codeword optimization and Gram matrix"]}],"abstract":"We characterize the total generalized squared correlation (TGSC) for a given signature sequence set used in uplink synchronous code division multiple access (S-CDMA) when channel state information is known perfectly at both transmitter and receiver.

To mitigate ICI, several cancellation schemes have been proposed but they require reliable channel information at the receiver which is quite challenging and costly under high mobility. To overcome these challenges, we investigate non-coherent detection as an alternative for the DVB-H system, and combine it with different ICI mitigating techniques that do not require channel information. Our simulation results show that the proposed non-coherent environment schemes outperform the coherent schemes in typical DVB-H scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent versus differential mobile OFDM with application to DVB-H","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567324","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567324.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","displayDocTitle":"Coherent versus differential mobile OFDM with application to DVB-H","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567324/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076311","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent versus differential mobile OFDM with application to DVB-H","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045565S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4567325,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Lin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Lin","lastName":"Lin","id":"38087755200"},{"name":"Pei-Ju Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Ju","lastName":"Lee","id":"38085094500"},{"name":"Cheng-Yuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Yuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37276902100"},{"name":"Guu-Chang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guu-Chang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37276271000"},{"name":"Wing C.

It is shown that, Bruunpsilas algorithm for FFT computation is ideally suited for SDR and should be used in preference over any classical FFT architecture for most practical cases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software algorithms","Software radio","Hardware","Computer architecture","Discrete cosine transforms","Communication standards","Wireless communication","Very large scale integration","Embedded system","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fast Fourier transforms","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bruun FFT algorithm","fast fourier transform","software defined radio","noise to signal ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567334","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567334","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567334.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567334","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the suitability of Bruun\u2019s FFT algorithm for software defined radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the suitability of Bruun\u2019s FFT algorithm for software defined radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567334/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567334/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076321","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the suitability of Bruun\u2019s FFT algorithm for software defined radio","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102017S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4567335,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Sorbara","affiliation":["Conexant Systems, Inc."],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Sorbara","id":"37654377300"},{"name":"Patrick Duvaut","affiliation":["Conexant Systems, Inc."],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Duvaut","id":"37266559700"},{"name":"Faina Shmulyian","affiliation":["Conexant Systems, Inc."],"firstName":"Faina","lastName":"Shmulyian","id":"38094467800"},{"name":"Shailendra Singh","affiliation":["Conexant Systems, Inc."],"firstName":"Shailendra","lastName":"Singh","id":"37635752100"},{"name":"Amitkumar Mahadevan","affiliation":["Conexant Systems, Inc."],"firstName":"Amitkumar","lastName":"Mahadevan","id":"37299270400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2483-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4567335","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"abstract":"Of growing interest in the field of VDSL2 transmission is the evaluation of algorithms for improved performance using far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation pre-coding. In order to perform fair evaluations of different algorithms, it is necessary to define a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel model that realistically represents the nature of the FEXT coupling dispersion that may be encountered in a multi-pair cable. This paper describes a general method for generating a MIMO channel model for a twisted wire pair cable that is extended from the currently defined 1% worst case FEXT coupling model. This extended model defines varying levels of FEXT cross-coupling values across the channel matrix and still preserves the 1% worst case crosstalk levels. Based on cable measurements, we determine a best fit probability density function to model the FEXT coupling dispersion; then for an example 25-pair 26-gauge (AWG) cable, we define four reference 25times25 channel matrices that contain varying degrees of channel dispersion: specifically, we define a 25times25 dispersion matrix for each of dasiazero,psila dasialow,psila dasiamedium,psila and dasiahighpsila dispersion. Finally, we compute rate vs. reach performance of FEXT Cancellation Pre-coding with cancellation of 5 dominant disturbers for each channel matrix.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567335.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of a DSL-MIMO channel model for evaluation of FEXT cancellation systems in VDSL2","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DSL","Dispersion","MIMO","Radio spectrum management","Crosstalk","Attenuation","Performance gain","Performance evaluation","Couplings","Wire"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","digital subscriber lines","MIMO communication","precoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSL-MIMO channel model","FEXT cancellation systems","VDSL2","far-end crosstalk cancellation pre-coding","multiple input multiple output channel model","multipair cable","twisted wire pair cable","cross-coupling channel matrix","coupling dispersion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","displayDocTitle":"Construction of a DSL-MIMO channel model for evaluation of FEXT cancellation systems in VDSL2","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567335/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076322","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of a DSL-MIMO channel model for evaluation of FEXT cancellation systems in VDSL2","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.187566S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4567341,"authors":[{"name":"V.

For commodity hardware, tomorrowpsilas performance gains will instead come from multicore architectures in which a whole set of CPUs executes concurrently. Taking advantage of the full power of multi-core processors for network intrusion prevention requires an indepth approach. In this work we frame an architecture customized for parallel execution of network attack analysis. At the lowest layer of the architecture is an ldquoActive Network Interfacerdquo (ANI), a custom device based on an inexpensive FPGA platform. The ANI provides the inline interface to the network, reading in packets and forwarding them after they are approved. It also serves as the front-end for dispatching copies of the packets to a set of analysis threads. The analysis itself is structured as an event-based system, which allows us to find many opportunities for concurrent execution, since events introduce a natural, decoupled asynchrony into the flow of analysis while still maintaining good cache locality. Finally, by associating events with the packets that ultimately stimulated them, we can determine when all analysis for a given packet has completed, and thus that it is safe to forward the pending packet - providing none of the analysis elements previously signaled that the packet should instead be discarded.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567341","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567341","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture for exploiting multi-core processors to parallelize network intrusion prevention","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","displayDocTitle":"An architecture for exploiting multi-core processors to parallelize network intrusion prevention","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567341/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10076328","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture for exploiting multi-core processors to parallelize network intrusion prevention","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05915S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567342,"authors":[{"name":"I-Tai Lu","affiliation":["Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"I-Tai","lastName":"Lu","id":"37297371700"},{"name":"Kun-Ju Tsai","affiliation":["Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kun-Ju","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37629570700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2483-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4567342","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":780},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","MIMO","Wireless LAN","Maximum likelihood estimation","Time domain analysis","Delay","Error analysis","Modulation coding","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","time-domain analysis","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","IEEE802.11n OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MIMO WLAN system","multiinput multioutput system","maximum likelihood method","time-domain truncation method","MMSE receiver","minimum mean square error","packet error rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Estimation","MIMO","OFDM","LAN","IEEE802.11n"]}],"abstract":"Effects of improved channel estimation are studied for a proposed IEEE 802.11n OFDM MIMO system.

Under these conditions, the conventional one-tap per subcarrier channel estimation and equalization is suboptimal since it does not account for ICI effects. A hybrid frequency and time-domain channel estimation method was developed in [1] to mitigate the ICI due to time-variation within one OFDM symbol.

Since at most one user is assigned to each of these tiles then reverse link transmissions within a sector are orthogonal. However, the transmission is affected by intercell interference since users in adjacent sectors may also have been assigned to the same tile. If those users in the adjacent sectors transmitted with high power then the intercell interference may severely limit the SINR achieved by the user.

We presents a reduced complexity adaptive channel estimator based on a set membership filtering approach known as the Optimal Bounding Ellipsoid (OBE) algorithm. To exploit time and frequency domain correlation properties of the channel in an efficient low-complexity way, we allow only a certain number of most significant channel impulse response taps to pass through time-domain adaptive filters while nulling the remaining taps. We obtain further complexity reduction by means of selective updating of the adaptive filters. Our proposed method overcomes the existing methodspsila drawbacks namely slow convergence, high sensitivity to channel statistics mismatch, and very high complexity. Comparisons with the existing methods (Robust MMSE estimator, adaptive NLMS and RLS estimators) corroborate advantages of our method in non-stationary time-varying wireless channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567346.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive channel estimation for OFDM systems in time-varying non-stationary wireless channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Time varying systems","Adaptive filters","Statistics","Ellipsoids","Filtering algorithms","Frequency domain analysis","Time domain analysis","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","channel estimation","least mean squares methods","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels","transient response","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel estimation","OFDM systems","time-varying nonstationary wireless channels","mobile wireless channels","nonstationary statistics","set membership filtering approach","optimal bounding ellipsoid algorithm","channel impulse response","time-domain adaptive filters","channel statistics mismatch","adaptive NLMS","RLS estimators","MMSE estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive channel estimation for OFDM systems in time-varying non-stationary wireless channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567346/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076333","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive channel estimation for OFDM systems in time-varying non-stationary wireless channels","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076227S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4567347,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid M.

Our solutions significantly reduce the number of operations which makes them more than 4 times faster than several other solutions in the literature. Furthermore, compared to fixed function VLSI implementations, our solution is more flexible and consumes less silicon area because the hardware is programmable and it can be reused for many other operations such as filtering, correlation and FFT/IFFT.

However, the a posteriori probability detector required for the conventional ST-BICM receiver is not amenable to practical implementation for high-rate MIMO due to its exponential complexity in rate. This motivated the development of a single-stream detector exhibiting polynomial complexity and capable of delivering performance comparable to the conventional detector under near-ideal conditions. However, under realistic operating scenarios, with possibly low-rank channel conditions and/or employing fewer receive antennas than transmitted streams, the performance gap between the single-stream detector and the conventional detector widens. With a view to enabling practical implementations of high-rate near-capacity MIMO, we propose a novel detector based on a group-wise approach that can be flexibly configured to deliver the best possible combination of performance and complexity over a wide range of realistic operating conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567359.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative MIMO detector using a group-wise approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","MIMO","Detectors","Interleaved codes","Modulation coding","Polynomials","Search methods","Collaboration","Government","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","MIMO communication","modulation coding","polynomials","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative MIMO detector","group-wise approach","multiple-input multiple-output systems","space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation","ST-BICM receiver","single-stream detector","polynomial complexity","receive antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","displayDocTitle":"Iterative MIMO detector using a group-wise approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567359/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076346","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative MIMO detector using a group-wise approach","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068106S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4567371,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

With the growth in demand from users - both commercial and military - and the scarcity of available RF spectrum, FSOC has the potential to offer a solution.

However, the ability to construct an FSOC network has many challenges such as pointing, acquisition and tracking; propagation impairments like weather; eye safety and others. In many of these cases, this will result in an intermittently-connected network, though of tremendous capacity on a per-link basis.

In cooperative diversity, single-antenna radios behave as relays between a source and destination, and the performance improvements are due to cooperation of the source and the relay. However, a misbehaving relay can degrade the envisaged performance improvements severely. In practice, there are no mechanisms to ensure adherence of the relay to cooperation strategy. Due to this dependency on relaypsilas behavior cooperative diversity presents a new security challenge at the physical layer. In this paper, we investigate performance of cooperative diversity in the presence of a semi-malicious relay which does not conform to rules of cooperation at all time.

Conventionally, data packets that are not correctly detected are usually dropped. These dropped packets can be used to help data packet detection. By exploiting all the retransmitted packets, data packets can be correctly detected with higher probability. The proposed approach provides a way to detect the packet by canceling out the known interference and summing up the residue received signal for all the retransmissions of a packet. Higher throughput is obtained with this approach. Regarding fairness, our proposed approach performs better than the power control approach. An algorithm is brought out to find the transmission probabilities for all the users to get maximum throughput with control of fairness. Higher power efficiency, defined as a new measure to estimate cross-layer performance, is achieved. Hence power control, which is critical in wireless communications, can be relaxed with the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567378","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer optimization with retransmission diversity in wireless CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer optimization with retransmission diversity in wireless CDMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567378/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076364","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567378/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer optimization with retransmission diversity in wireless CDMA networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055756S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4567379,"authors":[{"name":"Ward S.

However, the overhead of IEEE 802.11 MAC layer has limited the actual throughput of a WLAN. A-MPDU aggregation suggested in IEEE 802.11n draft is a key enhancement reducing the protocol timing overheads that enables aggregation of several MAC-level protocol data units (MPDUs) into a single PHY protocol data unit (PPDU). Another aggregation scheme proposed in IEEE 802.11n is A-MSDU aggregation, which allows several MAC-level service data units (MSDUs) to be aggregated into a single MPDU. In this work we present a novel analytic model for estimating the performance of a 802.11n high throughput wireless link between a station and an Access Point (AP). We consider a 2 times 2 MIMO system and investigate how the MAC goodput under TCP and UDP traffic is affected by the aggregation size, packet error rate and PHY settings. Our results demonstrate that for UDP traffic, A-MPDU aggregation allows to achieve a high channel utilization of 95% in the ideal case while without aggregation the channel utilization is limited by just 33%. We also show that A-MPDU aggregation outperforms A-MSDU aggregation, whose performance considerably degrades for high packet error rates and high PHY rates.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567389","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4556635/4567303/04567389.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of A-MPDU and A-MSDU aggregation in IEEE 802.11n","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of A-MPDU and A-MSDU aggregation in IEEE 802.11n","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4567389/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10076375","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567389/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of A-MPDU and A-MSDU aggregation in IEEE 802.11n","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051495S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4556635","isNumber":"4567303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4556635","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4567303","articleId":"4567389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4567412,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Funahashi","affiliation":["Department of Biosciences and Informatics, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4567402/4567412/4567412-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Akira Funahashi received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Keio University, Japan, in 1995, 1997, and 2000, respectively.","His research interests include the areas of systems biology, computational biology, interconnection networks, and parallel processing.

To facilitate this research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called CellDesigner. CellDesigner primarily has capabilities to visualize, model, and simulate gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS X).

challenges for postgenomic biology is to understand how genes, proteins, and small molecules dynamically interact to form molecular networks which facilitate sophisticated biological functions. In this paper, we present a survey on recent developments on modelling molecular networks and analyzing synchronization of bio-oscillators in multicellular systems from the viewpoint of systems biology. Attention will be focused on deriving general theoretical results to understand the dynamical behaviors of biological systems based on nonlinear dynamical and control theory. Specifically, we first describe the stochastic and deterministic approaches to model molecular networks and give a brief comparison between them. Then, we explain how to construct a molecular network, in particular, a gene regulatory network with specific functions, e.g., switches and oscillators, in individual cells at the molecular level by using feedback systems, and how to model a general multicellular system with the consideration of external fluctuations and intercellular coupling to study the general cooperative behaviors for a population of bio-oscillators. Finally, as an illustrative example, a synthetic multicellular system is designed to show how synchronization is effectively achieved and how dynamics of individual cells is efficiently controlled. Some recent developments and perspectives of analysis on biological oscillations in future are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"96","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10115084","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analyzing Biological Oscillations in Molecular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analyzing Biological Oscillations in Molecular Networks","sourcePdf":"96jproc08-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091633S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"4567402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"29","articleId":"4567422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4567432,"authors":[{"name":"Florent Jangal","affiliation":["Electromagnetism and Radar Department, ONERA French Aero Space Laboratory, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Jangal","id":"37399820100"},{"name":"St\u00c9phane Saillant","affiliation":["Electromagnetism and Radar Department, ONERA French Aero Space Laboratory, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"St\u00c9phane","lastName":"Saillant","id":"37621005400"},{"name":"Marc Helier","affiliation":["UPMC University Paris-06, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Helier","id":"37301268000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4567432","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":732},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"High-frequency waves (3-30 MHz) interact with the sea surface. Thus, a high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) is well suited to perform remote sensing of the sea. The HFSWR coverage range is not limited by the radio horizon: it is possible to keep watch over the sea up to a few hundred kilometers from the coastline. Oceanographic parameters (i.e., wave height, surface current velocity, wind direction, and wind velocity) are derived from the so-called sea spectrum. Moreover, the HFSWR can be used for maritime surveillance of the Exclusive Economic Zone. In that case, the sea spectrum is an unwanted signal because it can mask targets. Sea spectrum extraction is an important issue for HFSWR signal processing since it is a key point for the remote sensing accuracy and the target detection features. In this letter, we show how wavelets may be applied to improve the remote sensing of oceanographic parameters and the target detection using wavelet-based sea clutter extraction. The results obtained using real data with opportune targets validate our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4567424/04567432.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.923211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.923211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Contribution to Remote Sensing of the Sea and Target Detection for a High-Frequency Surface Wave Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remote sensing","Object detection","Surface waves","Sea surface","Radar remote sensing","Wind speed","Watches","Surveillance","Signal processing","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","ocean waves","oceanographic techniques","radar clutter","radar signal processing","remote sensing by radar","signal detection","wavelet transforms","wind"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing","target detection","high frequency surface wave radar","sea surface wave height","sea surface current velocity","sea surface wind direction","sea surface wind velocity","sea spectrum extraction","HFSWR signal processing","wavelet transforms","wavelet based sea clutter extraction","frequency 3 MHz to 30 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-frequency (HF) radar","remote sensing","surface waves","target detection","wavelets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Contribution to Remote Sensing of the Sea and Target Detection for a High-Frequency Surface Wave Radar","volume":"5","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4567432/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10115219","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Contribution to Remote Sensing of the Sea and Target Detection for a High-Frequency Surface Wave Radar","sourcePdf":"05lgrs03-jangal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05198S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4567424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4567424","articleId":"4567432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4567443,"authors":[{"name":"Viveck R.

This paper presented a method to extract run-time temperature information from multiple SRAM cells simultaneously ever since it has becoming one of the highest heat dissipation members subsequent to the increase demands in density and speed for many applications. By optimizing the bit-line loads with the pull-down transistors, the range of the voltage variations correspond to temperature scale can be quantified for feedback system. The mechanism will beneficial the SRAM from possible soft-thermal errors, which is hold by its Static Noise Margin(SNM), also improve the reliability(eg. hard-thermal errors) of the system. The proposed methods fulfilled those needs to incorporate a sensor closer to defect area with minimized hardware overhead. Correspondingly, we did not cause anything that worsens the 6T-SRAM designs, such as SNM and the minimal sizing of SRAM cell requirement.","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2006 - 2006 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2006 - 2006 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4145316/4118066/04567444.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Smart Temperature Sensor: Extracting Run-time Temperature within SRAM Cells","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2006.4567444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2006.4567444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Smart Temperature Sensor: Extracting Run-time Temperature within SRAM Cells","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4567444/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Smart Temperature Sensor: Extracting Run-time Temperature within SRAM Cells","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076018S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4145316","isNumber":"4118066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4145316","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4118066","articleId":"4567444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4567449,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Battista","affiliation":["CNRS, Aix Marseille University, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Battista","id":"37599032700"},{"name":"Jean Gaubert","affiliation":["CNRS, Aix Marseille University, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Gaubert","id":"37270752100"},{"name":"Matthieu Egels","affiliation":["CNRS, Aix Marseille University, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Egels","id":"37270751700"},{"name":"Sylvain Bourdel","affiliation":["CNRS, Aix Marseille University, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Bourdel","id":"37270750000"},{"name":"Herv\u00c9 Barthelemy","affiliation":["CNRS, Aix Marseille University, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Herv\u00c9","lastName":"Barthelemy","id":"37269236100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4567449","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise figure","Voltage","1f noise","Low-noise amplifiers","Ultra wideband technology","Impedance matching","Bandwidth","Frequency","Design methodology","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","low noise amplifiers","microwave receivers","MMIC amplifiers","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-voltage-gain CMOS LNA","UWB receivers","low noise amplifiers","ultrawideband integrated receivers","original LC input matching cell architecture","fractional bandwidths","low noise figure","frequency 6 GHz to 8.5 GHz","size 0.13 mum","noise figure 29.5 dB","noise figure 4.5 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers (LNAs)","ultra wide band (UWB)","CMOS integrated circuits"]}],"abstract":"The design of a fully integrated CMOS low noise amplifiers (LNA) for ultra-wide-band (UWB) integrated receivers is presented.

A specialized genetic algorithm (GA) with properly designed operators is a fundamental element of this method and performs the theoretical synthesis of a necessary nonuniform LPFG period profile. Such a profile yields a linear response of the sensor to the refractive index of the external medium. A distinctive feature of the designed LPFG is a linear gradient of the core and cladding refractive index along the grating length. Also, a new mathematical model of nonuniform LPFGs is presented, the model permits to take into account the effect of some LPFG sections of a lower and others of a higher cladding refractive index than that of the external medium. The application of both the design method and the mathematical model is illustrated with a numerical example.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2008.926525","startPage":"1130","endPage":"1137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4567453/04567470.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2008.926525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Long-Period Fiber Grating Refractometric Sensors With Linear Response by a Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Optical fiber sensors","Fiber gratings","Genetic algorithms","Refractive index","Mathematical model","Optical refraction","Design methodology","Optical design","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffraction gratings","fibre optic sensors","genetic algorithms","optical fibre cladding","refractive index measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-period fiber grating refractometric sensors","linear response","genetic algorithm","sensor linear response","refractive index","cladding refractive index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber gratings","genetic algorithms (GAs)","optical fiber measurements","refraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of Long-Period Fiber Grating Refractometric Sensors With Linear Response by a Genetic Algorithm","volume":"8","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4567470/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10115095","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Long-Period Fiber Grating Refractometric Sensors With Linear Response by a Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"08jsen07-floresllamas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084661S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4567453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4567453","articleId":"4567470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4567473,"authors":[{"name":"Augustin Grillet","affiliation":["Kortrijk, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/4567453/4567473/4567473-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Augustin Grillet graduated in physics from the University of Essex, Essex, U.K., and INSA, Toulouse, France.","He started his career in 2001 at Alcatel Submarine Networks, U.K., and in 2002 moved to the Applied Photonics Department, Multitel, Belgium.

NN architecture is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with two analog input signals provided by the rangefinder, three processing neurons in the hidden layer, and one output neuron whose output voltage indicates the detected surface. As the complete structure is analog, no analog-to-digital conversions or signal processing between the rangefinder and the network is necessary. Furthermore, the 3.3-V voltage supply, relative to the chosen CMOS 0.35-mum technology, allows to reduce the system power consumption. This paper focuses on the implementation in an ASIC of an elementary part of the NN, called neuron, and on the achievement of the complete NN from the integration of three ASICs in a printed circuit board.

However, both the extent and accuracy of force application are significantly limited by the nonlinearity of the commonly used optical lever with a nonlinear position-sensitive detector (PSD). In order to compensate the nonlinearity of the optical lever, a nonlinear calibration method is presented. This method applies the nonlinear curve fit to a full-range position-voltage response of the photodiode, obtaining a continuous function of its voltage-related sensitivity. Thus, interaction forces can be defined as integrals of this sensitivity function between any two responses of photodiode voltage outputs, instead of rough transformation with a single conversion factor. The lateral position-voltage response of the photodiode, a universally acknowledged puzzle, was directly characterized by an accurately calibrated force sensor composed of a tippless piezoresistive microcantilever and corresponding electronics, regardless of any knowledge of the cantilevers and laser measuring system. Experiments using a rectangular cantilever (normal spring constant 0.24 N/m) demonstrated that the proposed nonlinear calibration method restrained the sensitivity error of normal position-voltage responses to 3.6% and extended the force application range.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4567509/04567531.pdf","startPage":"1478","endPage":"1485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2008.920722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2008.920722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Accuracy of Force Application for AFM Nanomanipulation Using Nonlinear Calibration of Optical Levers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atomic force microscopy","Calibration","Nonlinear optics","Optical sensors","Photodiodes","Voltage","Atom optics","Force control","Process control","Position sensitive particle detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","control nonlinearities","end effectors","force sensors","nanopositioning","photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force application","AFM nanomanipulation","nonlinear calibration","optical lever nonlinearity","atomic force microscope","nano-effector","force sensing","nonlinear position-sensitive detector","full-range position-voltage response","photodiode response","voltage-related sensitivity","piezoresistive microcantilever","force sensor","rectangular cantilever"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atomic force microscope (AFM)","force calibration","nanomanipulation","nonlinearity compensation","optical lever"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Accuracy of Force Application for AFM Nanomanipulation Using Nonlinear Calibration of Optical Levers","volume":"8","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4567531/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115140","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Accuracy of Force Application for AFM Nanomanipulation Using Nonlinear Calibration of Optical Levers","sourcePdf":"08jsen08-xie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12757S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4567509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4567509","articleId":"4567531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567532,"authors":[{"name":"R.

An equivalent affinelike representation in terms of the tracking error dynamics is first obtained from the original nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time system so that reinforcement-learning-based near-optimal neural network (NN) controller can be developed. The control scheme consists of two linearly parameterized NNs. One NN is designated as the critic NN, which approximates a predefined long-term cost function, and an action NN is employed to derive a near-optimal control signal for the system to track a desired trajectory while minimizing the cost function simultaneously. The NN weights are tuned online. By using the standard Lyapunov approach, the stability of the closed-loop system is shown. The net result is a supervised actor-critic NN controller scheme which can be applied to a general nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time system without needing the affinelike representation. Simulation results demonstrate satisfactory performance of the controller.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.926607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4567535/04567550.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"1001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.926607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Nonaffine Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Using Reinforcement-Learning-Based Linearly Parameterized Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567550/","displayDocTitle":"Control of Nonaffine Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Using Reinforcement-Learning-Based Linearly Parameterized Neural Networks","volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10091308","pubMedId":"18632390","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567550/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Nonaffine Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Using Reinforcement-Learning-Based Linearly Parameterized Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb04-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084487S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4567535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4567535","articleId":"4567550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567551,"authors":[{"name":"Yijia Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4567535/4567551/4567551-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yijia Zhao received the B.S. degree in mathematics and computer science and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

In conventional studies, the standard nonlinear effects are very strongly rejected because they generate harmonics of the microwave frequency that are definitely out of the selective oscillator bandwidth. However, we show that the nonlinearity still affects the slowly varying dynamics of microwave envelope, thereby inducing dynamical instabilities within the oscillator bandwidth. Starting from a full integro-differential model, we use the multiple timescales method to build a delay-differential equation for the slowly varying complex envelope of the microwave. Then, the corresponding stationary solutions are derived, and the stability of their amplitude and phase is investigated in detail as a function of the feedback gain. We evidence essential bifurcation phenomena, and, in particular, we demonstrate that the generated microwave may turn unstable if the gain is increased beyond a precise critical value. This nonlinear dynamics approach, therefore, demonstrates that the amplitude of the ultrapure microwave's amplitude does not monotonously increase with the gain. The theoretical study is confirmed by numerical simulations and experimental measurements. </para>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Dynamics and Spectral Stability of Optoelectronic Microwave Oscillators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2008.925121","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/4563493/04567552.pdf","startPage":"858","endPage":"866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2008.925121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Dynamics and Spectral Stability of Optoelectronic Microwave Oscillators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4567552/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Dynamics and Spectral Stability of Optoelectronic Microwave Oscillators","sourcePdf":"44jqe09-chembo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061512S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"4563493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4563493","articleId":"4567552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4567554,"authors":[{"name":"Ram\u00d3n Maldonado","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y de Educaci\u00f3n, Superior de Ensenada, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/4563493/4567554/4567554-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ram\u00f3n Maldonado was born in Puebla, M\u00e9xico, in 1973.

An interesting feature of the proposed protocol is that, at high multiplexing gains, it resembles a multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, and at low multiplexing gains, it provides each user with the same DMT as if there were no contention for the relay from the other users.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.926336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4567442/04567563.pdf","startPage":"3728","endPage":"3733","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.926336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Case for Amplify\u2013Forward Relaying in the Block-Fading Multiple-Access Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Case for Amplify\u2013Forward Relaying in the Block-Fading Multiple-Access Channel","volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4567563/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115056","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Case for Amplify\u2013Forward Relaying in the Block-Fading Multiple-Access Channel","sourcePdf":"54tit08-chen-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081566S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4567442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4567442","articleId":"4567563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4567569,"authors":[{"name":"Constantinos Daskalakis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and ComputerScience, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Constantinos","lastName":"Daskalakis","id":"37322240700"},{"name":"Alexandros G.

Specifically, we show that for a random LDPC code ensemble, the linear programming decoder of Feldman succeeds in correcting a constant fraction of errors with high probability. The fraction of correctable errors guaranteed by our analysis surpasses previous nonasymptotic results for LDPC codes, and in particular, exceeds the best previous finite-length result on LP decoding by a factor greater than ten. This improvement stems in part from our analysis of probabilistic bit-flipping channels, as opposed to adversarial channels. At the core of our analysis is a novel combinatorial characterization of LP decoding success, based on the notion of a flow on the Tanner graph of the code. An interesting by-product of our analysis is to establish the existence of ldquoprobabilistic expansionrdquo in random bipartite graphs, in which one requires only that almost every (as opposed to every) set of a certain size expands, for sets much larger than in the classical worst case setting.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.926452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.926452","startPage":"3565","endPage":"3578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4567442/04567569.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Analysis of Linear Programming Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Analysis of Linear Programming Decoding","volume":"54","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10115057","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567569/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Analysis of Linear Programming Decoding","sourcePdf":"54tit08-daskalakis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152114S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4567442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4567442","articleId":"4567569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4567571,"authors":[{"name":"Azadeh Faridi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technologies, University of Pompeu-Fabra, Barcelona, Spain","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Azadeh","lastName":"Faridi","id":"37547593600"},{"name":"Anthony Ephremides","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ephremides","id":"37265761500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4567571","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Government","Collaborative work","Nonhomogeneous media","Couplings","Processor scheduling","Communication networks","Computer architecture","Channel coding","Buffer overflow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","open loop systems","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion control","delay-sensitive sources","minimum-distortion policies","streaming delay-sensitive data","distortion-tolerant data","cross-layer approaches","presentation layers","transport layers","source-destination pair","closed-loop heuristic policies","numerical evaluation","open-loop policy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay-sensitive","distortion","scheduling","source-coding","streaming"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the problem of finding minimum-distortion policies for streaming delay-sensitive but distortion-tolerant data.

This optimum policy turns out to be independent of the exact form of the convex and decreasing distortion function. Then, for a packet-erasure channel, we analytically find the optimum open-loop transmission policy, which is also independent of the form of the convex distortion function.

In this paper, the concept of group testing is generalized to applications with correlated source models to derive scheduling policies for sensors' adopting cooperative transmissions. The tenet of our work is that in a wireless sensor network it is advantageous to allocate the same channel dimensions to all sensor sources that have the same response to a sequence of queries or tests. That is, nodes that have the same data attributes should transmit as a cooperative super-source. Specifically, we consider the case where sensors' data are modeled spatially as a one-dimensional Markov chain. Two strategies are considered: the recursive algorithm and the tree-based algorithm. The recursive scheme allows us to illustrate the performance of group testing for finite populations while the tree-based algorithm is used to derive the achievable scaling performances of the class of group testing strategies as the number of sensors increases. We show that the total number of queries required to gather all sensors' data scales in the order of the joint entropy. A further generalization of this concept provides the basis of deriving efficient data-gathering algorithms for correlated sources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567578/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115039","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Group Testing for Binary Markov Sources: Data-Driven Group Queries for Cooperative Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group Testing for Binary Markov Sources: Data-Driven Group Queries for Cooperative Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"54tit08-hong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109167S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4567442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4567442","articleId":"4567578","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4567579,"authors":[{"name":"Milos Ivkovic","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Ivkovic","id":"37282722400"},{"name":"Shashi Kiran Chilappagari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shashi Kiran","lastName":"Chilappagari","id":"37321432800"},{"name":"Bane Vasic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Bane","lastName":"Vasic","id":"37274466600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4567579","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":858},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567579","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Convolutional codes","AWGN channels","Iterative algorithms","Error analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Convolution","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","binary codes","channel coding","convolutional codes","decoding","graph theory","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Tanner graph cover","channel-decoding algorithm","low-density parity-check code","convolutional LDPC code","binary symmetric channel","AWGN channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional low-density parity-codes (LDPC) codes","error floor","Gallager B","low-density parity codes (LDPC) codes","min-sum decoding algorithm","Tanner code","trapping sets"]}],"abstract":"We discuss error floor asympotics and present a method for improving the performance of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in the high SNR (error floor) region. The method is based on Tanner graph covers that do not have trapping sets from the original code. The advantages of the method are that it is universal, as it can be applied to any LDPC code/channel/decoding algorithm and it improves performance at the expense of increasing the code length, without losing the code regularity, without changing the decoding algorithm, and, under certain conditions, without lowering the code rate. The proposed method can be modified to construct convolutional LDPC codes also.

However, it is also well known that LEs provide inferior performance relative to a maximum-likelihood equalizer (MLE) or other near-MLEs, because LEs usually cannot collect the diversity order enabled by the transmitter and at the same time they lose mutual information. More importantly, unlike MLE or near-MLEs, the performance of LEs has not been well quantified. This hinders more general applications of LEs in wireless systems. In this paper, we reveal a fundamental link between a channel parameter-orthogonality deficiency (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">od</i>\n) of the channel matrix-and the diversity and capacity of LEs.

In this scenario, it is assumed that each transmitter is unaware of the other transmitter's data (noncooperative scenario). This system can be considered as a combination of two broadcast channels (from the transmitters' points of view) and two multiple-access channels (from the receivers' points of view). Taking advantage of both perspectives, two signaling schemes for such a scenario are developed. In these schemes, some linear filters are employed at the transmitters and at the receivers which decompose the system into either two noninterfering multiple-antenna broadcast subchannels or two noninterfering multiple-antenna multiple-access subchannels. The main objective in the design of the filters is to exploit the structure of the channel matrices to achieve the highest multiplexing gain (MG). It is shown that the proposed noncooperative signaling schemes outperform other known noncooperative schemes in terms of the achievable MG. In particular, it is shown that in some specific cases, the achieved MG is the same as the MG of the system if full cooperation is provided either between the transmitters or between the receivers. In the second part of the paper, it is shown that by using mixed design schemes, rather than decomposition schemes, and taking the statistical properties of the interference terms into account, the power offset of the system can be improved. The power offset represents the horizontal shift in the curve of the sum-rate versus the total power in decibels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567589/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","volume":"54","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10115025","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Communication Over MIMO X Channels: Interference Alignment, Decomposition, and Performance Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication Over MIMO X Channels: Interference Alignment, Decomposition, and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"54tit08-maddahali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046129S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"4567442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"727","articleId":"4567589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4567596,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Shi Pang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jong-Shi","lastName":"Pang","id":"37398640400"},{"name":"Gesualdo Scutari","affiliation":["Department INFOCOM, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Gesualdo","lastName":"Scutari","id":"37269398400"},{"name":"Francisco Facchinei","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Systems Science Antonio Ruberti, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Facchinei","id":"37397893900"},{"name":"Chaoxiong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Chaoxiong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38089504800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4567596","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1236},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference constraints","Interference channels","Sufficient conditions","Iterative algorithms","Quality of service","Power control","Nash equilibrium","Distributed computing","Distributed algorithms","Information rates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","quality of service","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power allocation","rate constraints","Gaussian parallel interference channels","power control problem","Nash equilibrium game","sequential iterative water-filling algorithms","simultaneous iterative water-filling algorithms","practical distributed multipoint-to-multipoint interference","quality of service","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game theory","Gaussian parallel interference channel","generalized Nash equilibrium (NE)","iterative water-filling algorithm","mutual information","spectrum sharing"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the minimization of transmit power in Gaussian parallel interference channels, subject to a rate constraint for each user.

The mean and variance of the mutual information are derived when the number of transmit and receive antennas grows asymptotically large while their ratio approaches a finite constant.

Though the replica method allows to analyze complex systems in a comparatively simple way, some authors pointed out that its assumptions are not always rigorous. It is shown that the mutual information converges asymptotically to a Gaussian distribution under mild technical conditions, which are tantamount to assuming that the spatial correlation structure has no asymptotically dominant eigenmodes. The accuracy of the asymptotic approach is assessed by numerical results. It is shown that the approximation is very accurate in a wide range of system settings, even when the number of transmit and receive antennas is as small as a few units.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4567442/04567601.pdf","startPage":"3490","endPage":"3504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.926415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.926415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567442","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Mutual Information Statistics of Separately Correlated Rician Fading MIMO Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Statistics","Rician channels","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Multiaccess communication","Statistical distributions","Probability distribution","Physics","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","Gaussian distribution","MIMO communication","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic mutual information statistics","Rician fading MIMO channels correlation","probability distribution","multiple input multiple output channel","receive antennas","transmit antennas","replica method","code-division multiple access","CDMA","Gaussian distribution","spatial correlation structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","random matrices","replica method","Rician fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Mutual Information Statistics of Separately Correlated Rician Fading MIMO Channels","volume":"54","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115029","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Mutual Information Statistics of Separately Correlated Rician Fading MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"54tit08-taricco.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066642S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"4567442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","articleId":"4567601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567605,"authors":[{"name":"Yingquan Wu","affiliation":["Link A Media Devices Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yingquan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281229300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4567605","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":892},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567605","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error correction codes","Curve fitting","Binary codes","Memory","Wireless communication","Satellite communication","Galois fields","Magnetic materials","Optical materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","curve fitting","decoding","error correction codes","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["list decoding algorithms","Reed-Solomon codes","BCH codes","rational curve fitting algorithm","Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghen codes","error correction capability","binary codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Berlekamp algorithm","Berlekamp\u2013Massey algorithm","binary Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenghen (BCH) codes","Johnson bound","list decoding","rational curve-fitting algorithm","Reed\u2013Solomon codes"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we devise a rational curve fitting algorithm and apply it to the list decoding of Reed-Solomon and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghen (BCH) codes.

The goal of the base station is to select appropriate beamforming vectors so as to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all users under a power budget constraint. Since this max-min-fair transmit beamforming problem is NP-hard in general, a randomized polynomial time approximation approach based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) has been proposed recently where excellent performance in both simulated and measured wireless channels has been reported. This paper shows that the SDR-based approach can provide at least an O(1/M) approximation to the optimum solution, where M is the total number of users. This estimate implies that the SDR solution achieves an SINR that is at most (logM+O(1)) dB away from the highest possible value. The existence of such a data independent bound certifies the worst-case approximation quality of the SDR algorithm for any problem instance and any number of transmit antennas. For real-valued problems, the corresponding approximation ratio is shown to be O(1/M2), while the SINR loss due to SDR approximation is at most (2logM+O(1)) dB.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.921762","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567637/04567639.pdf","startPage":"3932","endPage":"3943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.921762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximation Bounds for Semidefinite Relaxation of Max-Min-Fair Multicast Transmit Beamforming Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567639/","displayDocTitle":"Approximation Bounds for Semidefinite Relaxation of Max-Min-Fair Multicast Transmit Beamforming Problem","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115194","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567639/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation Bounds for Semidefinite Relaxation of Max-Min-Fair Multicast Transmit Beamforming Problem","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-chang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087463S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4567637","articleId":"4567639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567641,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Ciblat","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement Com\u00e9lec, Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4567633/4567641/4567641-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Philippe Ciblat was born in Paris, France, in 1973.

The goal is the joint optimization of the processing matrices at both ends of the wireless link, assuming a constraint on the overall transmit power. We consider different design criteria which require the maximization/minimization of objective functions that depend on the mean square errors over the individual data streams. A unified framework for the solution of a great number of optimization problems is developed, based on the concept of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multiplicative</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Schur-convexity</i>\n. We show that many widely used design criteria can be easily accommodated in our framework. Our analysis is centered on two theorems which, in the case of cooperative processing among the different subcarriers, provide closed-form solutions to a number of optimization problems. On the other hand, when an independent processing is assumed at each subcarrier closed-form solutions may not exist. Nonetheless, exploiting the results of the two theorems, we show that for a variety of cost functions the optimization problem can be efficiently solved. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are used to assess the performance of the proposed schemes and make comparisons with linear transceiver architectures. It turns out that nonlinear precoding provides better results than linear prefiltering when the cost function is multiplicatively Schur-convex. In contrast, when the cost function is multiplicatively Schur-concave the nonlinear scheme is equivalent to the linear one.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.919094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567633/04567648.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.919094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567633","startPage":"3662","endPage":"3677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding in MIMO Systems: A Unified Approach to Transceiver Optimization Based on Multiplicative Schur-Convexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding in MIMO Systems: A Unified Approach to Transceiver Optimization Based on Multiplicative Schur-Convexity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567648/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115152","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567648/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding in MIMO Systems: A Unified Approach to Transceiver Optimization Based on Multiplicative Schur-Convexity","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-damico-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115428S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4567648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4567652,"authors":[{"name":"Yonina C.

This paper focuses on joint suppression of such two interferences in receiver design under the criterion of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE). The well-known Kalman filtering arises as a natural design tool to achieve the optimum joint suppression of the ISI and ICI in the sense of MMSE that results in a two-stage design method that suppresses the ISI and ICI in series. Specifically, a state-space solution is derived for the optimum decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) based on temporal Kalman filtering, and is shown to be equivalent to a conventional finite length DFE for ISI suppression. A novel spatial Kalman filtering scheme is proposed as the second stage to successively cancel the ICI. It is shown that the proposed two-stage method yields the realizable and optimum joint ISI and ICI suppression, while it admits lower computational complexity than the conventional finite length DFE for ISI suppression and the MMSE V-BLAST receiver for ICI suppression. The results are applicable to any linear channels that admit state-space realizations, including MIMO frequency selective time-varying channels, and are thus the most general. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method and its robustness to channel estimation uncertainties that may arise in practical systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.919389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567633/04567654.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.919389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567633","startPage":"3638","endPage":"3651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE Interference Suppression in MIMO Frequency Selective and Time-Varying Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MMSE Interference Suppression in MIMO Frequency Selective and Time-Varying Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115168","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4567654/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE Interference Suppression in MIMO Frequency Selective and Time-Varying Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-he-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121485S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4567654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567659,"authors":[{"name":"Ben A.

It is shown that several known performance measures of a communication system are rotation invariant. The rotation invariant property provides a unified framework for obtaining the structure of an optimum linear precoder for several criteria such as: 1) maximization of minimum distance; 2) maximization of channel capacity; and 3) optimization of different performance measures, such as bit-error rate (BER), mean square error, signal-to-noise ratio of optimum equalizers (linear minimum mean square error, zero-forcing, maximum likelihood (ML), zero forcing-block decision feedback, minimum mean square error-block decision feedback, etc.). This framework provides a method for obtaining the structure of an optimum linear precoder for BER performance measure of the ML equalizer. The structure turns out to be a channel diagonalizing structure after a prerotation of the input constellation. Using this structure, the properties of the optimum precoder that minimize the BER of the ML equalizer for two binary phase-shift keying symbols transmission under input-power constraint are studied.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.920147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.920147","startPage":"3690","endPage":"3701","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567633/04567664.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structure of an Optimum Linear Precoder and its Application to ML Equalizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Structure of an Optimum Linear Precoder and its Application to ML Equalizer","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","volume":"56","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567664/","accessionNumber":"10115172","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567664/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure of an Optimum Linear Precoder and its Application to ML Equalizer","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-lokesh-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08198S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4567664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4567665,"authors":[{"name":"Maja Loncar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Loncar","id":"37277438900"},{"name":"Fredrik Rusek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Rusek","id":"37283101000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4567665","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> This correspondence investigates the asymptotic behavior of reduced-state intersymbol interference (ISI) equalizers, based on the Ungerboeck and Forney observation models.

In a previous paper, the authors have presented a grid-based technique, based on a hidden Markov model, that used the power delay profiles of the received signals to track the MT position. This grid-based Bayesian method has proved its efficacy in reducing localization errors in realistic indoor environments with multipath effects and mixed line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight (LOS/NLOS) conditions. However, the computational power and the memory storage requirements limit its use in practical wireless networks. To improve the computational efficiency, here we propose a jump-Markov particle-filter approach as an extension of the previous work; the LOS/NLOS sight process is the jumping feature that drives the MT motion dynamics, while the particle filter is used to track the MT position. Performance analyses, carried out for realistic multipath indoor environments, show that, with respect to the previous grid-based algorithm, this novel approach greatly reduces the tracking filter complexity still preserving the same localization accuracy. Simulation results prove also the robustness of the proposed method with respect to the uncertainty of sight statistics information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","volume":"56","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10115173","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567668/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Jump Markov Particle Filter for Localization of Moving Terminals in Multipath Indoor Scenarios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Jump Markov Particle Filter for Localization of Moving Terminals in Multipath Indoor Scenarios","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-nicoli-cr-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023877S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4567668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4567674,"authors":[{"name":"Dominic Schuhmacher","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4567633/4567674/4567674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dominic Schuhmacher was born in Zurich, Switzerland, 1974.

In OFDM systems, PHN and CFO cause two effects: the common phase error (CPE) and the intercarrier interference (ICI) which severely degrade the accuracy of the channel estimate. In literature, several algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem. Nevertheless, in all these existing schemes, both the PHN and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) powers are assumed to be known. Because no a priori knowledge of PHN and AWGN powers is available at the receiver, we propose different strategies for the estimation of channel impulse response (CIR), CFO, PHN, and also the PHN and the AWGN powers. Based on Monte Carlo methods, the proposed approaches estimate these many unknowns in the time domain from a training OFDM symbol using either offline or online estimators. In the online case, we propose sequential Monte Carlo algorithms and especially an original maximization step of the joint a posteriori probability density function for the unknown parameters. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in terms of mean square error (MSE) on channel, phase distortions, and also noise power estimation.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.919629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567633/04567677.pdf","startPage":"3613","endPage":"3626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.919629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo Methods for Channel, Phase Noise, and Frequency Offset Estimation With Unknown Noise Variances in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567677/","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo Methods for Channel, Phase Noise, and Frequency Offset Estimation With Unknown Noise Variances in OFDM Systems","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115162","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567677/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo Methods for Channel, Phase Noise, and Frequency Offset Estimation With Unknown Noise Variances in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-septier-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112173S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4567677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567678,"authors":[{"name":"Shuying Shi","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Chair for Mobile Communications, Technical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4567633/4567678/4567678-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuying Shi (S'05) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Kaiserslautern, Germany, in 2002.

The non-convexity of these problems makes the derivation of globally optimal algorithms very difficult for transceiver design. New optimal power allocation strategies are derived for the problems considered here. Based on the power allocation, we study how this can be used for iterative transceiver optimization. We propose iterative algorithms and prove the monotonic convergence of the algorithms. The major advantages of the proposed algorithms are their low complexity and fast convergence behavior during the first few iterations.

In this paper, we develop a new, heuristic, graph-structured, sparse signal representation algorithm for overcomplete dictionaries that can be decomposed into subdictionaries and whose dictionary elements can be arranged in a hierarchy. Around this algorithm, we construct a methodology for advanced image formation in wide-angle synthetic aperture radar (SAR), defining an approach for joint anisotropy characterization and image formation. Additionally, we develop a coordinate descent method for jointly optimizing a parameterized dictionary and recovering a sparse representation using that dictionary. The motivation is to characterize a phenomenon in wide-angle SAR that has not been given much attention before: migratory scattering centers, i.e., scatterers whose apparent spatial location depends on aspect angle. Finally, we address the topic of recovering solutions that are sparse in more than one objective domain by introducing a suitable sparsifying cost function. We encode geometric objectives into SAR image formation through sparsity in two domains, including the normal parameter space of the Hough transform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Representation in Structured Dictionaries With Application to Synthetic Aperture Radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.919392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567633/04567680.pdf","startPage":"3548","endPage":"3561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.919392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Representation in Structured Dictionaries With Application to Synthetic Aperture Radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4567680/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115164","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Representation in Structured Dictionaries With Application to Synthetic Aperture Radar","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-varshney-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13107S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4567680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4567681,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqi Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4567633/4567681/4567681-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianqi Wang received the B.Eng. degree in automation from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1997 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Colorado State University, Fort Collins, in 2002.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.

This algorithm serves as a general mathematical framework that includes a number of existing greedy user selection methods as its realizations. As previous results only give the scaling law of the sum rate of dirty paper coding (DPC), with the help of the G-greedy structure, we are able to obtain the exact limit of the DPC sum rate for a large number of users. We also prove that the difference between the sum rates obtained by G-greedy user selection and by DPC goes to zero as the number of users increases. In addition to this, we investigate one particular greedy user selection scheme called sequential water-filling (SWF). For this algorithm, a complexity reduction is achieved by an iterative procedure based on an LQ decomposition, which converts the calculation of the Moore-Penrose matrix inverse to one vector-matrix multiplication. A sufficient condition is given to prune the search space of this algorithm that results in further complexity reduction. With the help of the G-greedy algorithm, we prove that SWF achieves the full DPC sum rate for a large number of users. For a moderate number of users, simulation demonstrates that, compared with other user selection algorithms, SWF achieves a higher sum rate that is close to the maximal sum rate achievable by ZFBF with the same order of complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.919096","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567633/04567681.pdf","startPage":"3713","endPage":"3726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.919096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Selection With Zero-Forcing Beamforming Achieves the Asymptotically Optimal Sum Rate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567681/","displayDocTitle":"User Selection With Zero-Forcing Beamforming Achieves the Asymptotically Optimal Sum Rate","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115149","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567681/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Selection With Zero-Forcing Beamforming Achieves the Asymptotically Optimal Sum Rate","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-wang-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094753S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4567681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4567684,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4567633/4567684/4567684-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Zhang (S'03) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China, in 2000 and the M.Sc. degree with specialization in wireless systems from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, in 2002.","From 2000 to 2001, he was with Microsoft Asia Regional Engineering Center, Shanghai.

Accurate CSI at the transmitter is often not possible or may require high feedback rates. Herein, we consider the robust design of linear MIMO transceivers with perfect CSI either at the transmitter or at both sides of the link. The framework considers the design problem where the imperfect CSI consists of the channel mean and covariance matrix or, equivalently, the channel estimate and the estimation error covariance matrix. The robust transceiver design is based on a general cost function of the average MSEs as well as a design with individual MSE based constraints. In particular, a lower bound of the average MSE matrix is explored for the design when only the CSI at the transmitter is imperfect. Under different CSI conditions, the proposed robust transceivers exhibit a similar structure to the transceiver designs for perfect CSI, but with a different equivalent channel and/or noise covariance matrix.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.919384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567633/04567684.pdf","startPage":"3678","endPage":"3689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.919384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistically Robust Design of Linear MIMO Transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567684/","displayDocTitle":"Statistically Robust Design of Linear MIMO Transceivers","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115167","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4567684/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistically Robust Design of Linear MIMO Transceivers","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-zhang-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115521S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4567684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4567800,"authors":[{"name":"Silvio Micali","affiliation":["Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy","University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Silvio","lastName":"Micali","id":"37371531600"},{"name":"Vijay V.

In general, we may use the McNaughton-Yamada algorithm to convert a regular expression of length n into a nondeterministic finite automaton with at most 2n states and 4n transitions. Instead of converting the nondeterministic device to a deterministic one, we propose two ways of implementing the nondeterministic device directly. First, we could produce a PLA (programmable logic array) of approximate dimensions 4n \u00d7 4n by representing the states directly by columns, rather than coding the states in binary. This approach, while theoretically suboptimal, makes use of carefully developed technology and, because of the care with which PLA implementation has been done, may be the preferred technique in many real situations. Another approach is to use the hierarchical structure of the automaton produced from the regular expression to guide a hierarchical layout of the circuit. This method produces a circuit 0(\u221an) on a side and is, to within a constant factor, the best that can be done in general.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable logic arrays","Automata","Signal processing","Space technology","Counting circuits","MOS devices","Wires","Integrated circuit modeling","Process control","Circuit synthesis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567827","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1980.44","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1980)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567793/4567794/04567827.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1980.44","startPage":"260","endPage":"269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567794","publicationTitle":"21st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1980)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The compilation of regular expressions into integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The compilation of regular expressions into integrated circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 1980","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 1980","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The compilation of regular expressions into integrated circuits","confLoc":"Syracuse, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"542800260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046519S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 1980","isNumber":"4567794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567793","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4567827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4567828,"authors":[{"name":"Charles E.

The algorithm maintains a sparse representation for layouts that is based on the well-known UNION-FIND data structure, and as a result, the running time devoted to bookkeeping is nearly linear.","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1980)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567793/4567794/04567828.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"281","publicationTitle":"21st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1980)","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1980.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1980.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area-efficient graph layouts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Wires","Concurrent computing","Integrated circuit interconnections","Hardware","Computational modeling","Costs","Binary trees","Contracts","Particle separators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 1980","displayDocTitle":"Area-efficient graph layouts","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-efficient graph layouts","confLoc":"Syracuse, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"542800270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032586S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 1980","isNumber":"4567794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567793","citationCount":"136","articleId":"4567828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4567893,"authors":[{"name":"Ashok K.

Alternation links up time and space complexities rather well, in that alternating polynomial time equals deterministic polynomial space, and alternating linear space equals deterministic exponential time. Such considerations lead to a two-person game complete in polynomial time, and other games complete in exponential time. We also find that computability on a parallel processing machine is a rather rugged notion, and present two parallel processing models that are polynomially equivalent in their running times. We also show that while n-state alternating finite automata accept only regular sets that can be accepted by 22n-O(logn) state deterministic automata, alternating pushdown automata accept all languages accepted by Turing machines in deterministic exponential time.","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1976.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567878","startPage":"98","endPage":"108","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567877/4567878/04567893.pdf","publicationTitle":"17th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1976)","displayPublicationTitle":"17th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1976)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1976.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Turing machines","Automata","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Character recognition","Bridges","Game theory","Counting circuits","Mice"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 1976","displayDocTitle":"Alternation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567893/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1976","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternation","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"542800098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033479S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 1976","isNumber":"4567878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567877","citationCount":"74","articleId":"4567893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4567911,"authors":[{"name":"David A.

In this paper we show that many related problems are also NP-hard. In addition, we exhibit some new NP-complete problems. Most of the new results concern problems in which the nondeterminism is \"hidden\". That is, the problems are not explicitly stated in terms of one of a number of possibilities being true. Furthermore, most of these problems are in the areas of number theory or the theory of functions of a complex variable. Thus there is a rich mathematical theory that can be brought to bear. These results therefore introduce a class of NP-hard and NP-complete problems different from those known previously.","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1976.29","publicationTitle":"17th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1976)","displayPublicationTitle":"17th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1976)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4567877/4567878/04567911.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1976.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567878","startPage":"264","endPage":"267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some polynomial and integer divisibility problems are NP-HARD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4567911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Some polynomial and integer divisibility problems are NP-HARD","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4567911/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 1976","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some polynomial and integer divisibility problems are NP-HARD","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"542800264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051565S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 1976","isNumber":"4567878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4567877","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4567911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4567924,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Pnueli","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel","University of Pennsylvania, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Pnueli","id":"37266011200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"4567924","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2215,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":3299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic","Operating systems","Real time systems","Reasoning about programs","Stress","Power system modeling","Clocks","Programming profession","Safety","System recovery"]}],"abstract":"A unified approach to program verification is suggested, which applies to both sequential and parallel programs.

Our approach exploits the centro-Hermitian property of the unknown noise covariance matrix and makes use of the generalized correlation decomposition (GCD) to obtain an accurate estimate of the noise subspace and, consequently, of the user-of- interest channel vector. We also obtain optimal values of the GCD weighting matrices which maximally preserve the orthogonality of the estimated noise subspace to the actual signal subspace in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. It is shown that such an optimal choice of the weighting matrices transforms GCD to an extended form of the conventional canonical correlation decomposition (CCD). Simulation results further demonstrate that if such an extended CCD-based approach is used to estimate the user-of-interest channel vector, then the estimation performance can be substantially improved as compared to earlier SVD-based blind channel estimation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.928697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4652320/04568046.pdf","startPage":"5605","endPage":"5617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.928697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4652320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Correlation Decomposition-Based Blind Channel Estimation in DS-CDMA Systems With Unknown Wide-Sense Stationary Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Correlation Decomposition-Based Blind Channel Estimation in DS-CDMA Systems With Unknown Wide-Sense Stationary Noise","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4568046/","accessionNumber":"10265507","volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Correlation Decomposition-Based Blind Channel Estimation in DS-CDMA Systems With Unknown Wide-Sense Stationary Noise","sourcePdf":"56tsp11-zarifi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.229293S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4652320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4652320","articleId":"4568046","onlineDate":"18 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4568123,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi B.

It speeds up Christofides' travelling salesman approximation algorithm from O(n3) to O(n2.75 lg n). A list splitting problem that arises in Edmonds' matching algorithm is solved in O(m\u03b1(m,n)) time, where m is the number of operations on a universe of n elements; the list splitting algorithm does not use set merging.

Dynamic movement problems are of fundamental importance to robotics, but their computational complexity has not previously been investigated. We provide evidence that the 3-D dynamic movement problem is intractable even if B has only a constant number of degrees of freedom of movement. In particular, we prove the problem is PSPACE-hard if B is given a velocity modulus bound on its movements and is NP hard even if B has no velocity modulus bound, where in both cases B has 6 degrees of freedom. To prove these results we use a unique method of simulation of a Turing machine which uses time to encode configurations (whereas previous lower bound proofs in robotics used the system position to encode configurations and so required unbounded number of degrees of freedom). We also investigate a natural class of dynamic problems which we call asteroid avoidance problems: B, the object we wish to move, is a convex polyhedron which is free to move by translation with bounded velocity modulus, and the polyhedral obstacles have known translational trajectories but cannot rotate. This problem has many applications to robot, automobile, and aircraft collision avoidance. Our main positive results are polynomial time algorithms for the 2-D asteroid avoidance problem with bounded number of obstacles as well as single exponential time and nO(log n) space algorithms for the 3-D asteroid avoidance problem with an unbounded number of obstacles. Our techniques for solving these asteroid avoidance problems are novel in the sense that they are completely unrelated to previous algorithms for planning movement in the case of static obstacles. We also give some additional positive results for various other dynamic movers problems, and in particular give polynomial time algorithms for the case in which B has no velocity bounds and the movements of obstacles are algebraic in space-time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion planning in the presence of moving obstacles","publicationTitle":"26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1985)","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1985.36","displayPublicationTitle":"26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1985)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568115/4568116/04568138.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1985.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 1985","displayDocTitle":"Motion planning in the presence of moving obstacles","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion planning in the presence of moving obstacles","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"542800144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036569S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 1985","isNumber":"4568116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568115","citationCount":"127","articleId":"4568138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4568165,"authors":[{"name":"Benny Chor","affiliation":["Laboratory for Computer Science, MIT"],"firstName":"Benny","lastName":"Chor","id":"37284498600"},{"name":"Oded Goldreich","firstName":"Oded","lastName":"Goldreich"},{"name":"Johan Hasted","firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Hasted"},{"name":"Joel Freidmann","firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Freidmann"},{"name":"Steven Rudich","affiliation":["EECS"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Rudich","id":"37398195700"},{"name":"Roman Smolensky","affiliation":["EECS"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Smolensky","id":"37662147800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-0644-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"4568165","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":170,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":419},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568165","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Cryptography","Fault tolerance"]}],"abstract":"We consider the following adversarial situation.

Specifically, we show how two parties A and B can interactively generate a random integer N = p\u00b7q such that its secret, i.e., the prime factors (p, q), is hidden from either party individually but is recoverable jointly if desired. This can be utilized to give a protocol for two parties with private values i and j to compute any polynomially computable functions f(i,j) and g(i,j) with minimal knowledge transfer and a strong fairness property. As a special case, A and B can exchange a pair of secrets sA, sB, e.g. the factorization of an integer and a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph, in such a way that sA becomes computable by B when and only when sB becomes computable by A.

Several different models (COMMON, ARBITRARY, PRIORITY) have been used for algorithm design in the literature; these models differ in their method of write-conflict resolution. Recent work in separating these models ([FRW1,2,3], [LY]) has relied on further restrictions (limiting the size of memory or the power of processors); the only unrestricted results known concern the element distinctness problem ([FMW], [RSSW]). In this paper we contribute further unrestricted results. We consider the COLLISION model, a natural generalization of the Ethernet ([G]). Our main result is a lower bound of \u03a9(logloglogn) steps on COLLISION for a problem that can be done in O(1) steps on ARBITRARY. We use this result, together with a reduction performed by means of Ramsey's Theorem, to show that the powers of COMMON and COLLISION are incomparable. We also introduce a new and natural model, TOLERANT, and show that it is strictly less powerful than COLLISION and incomparable with COMMON. The proofs involved use combinatorial arguments, including Tur\u00e1n's Theorem for graphs and the Erd\u00f6s-Rado intersecting set theorem.","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1987.34","publicationTitle":"28th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1987)","displayPublicationTitle":"28th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1987)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568244/4568245/04568259.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1987.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568245","startPage":"89","endPage":"98","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incomparability in parallel computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incomparability in parallel computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568259/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 1987","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incomparability in parallel computation","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"542800089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033209S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 1987","isNumber":"4568245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568244","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4568259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4568273,"authors":[{"name":"Alok Aggarwal","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

We first study the model with f(x) = x\u03b1 for 0 \u226a \u03b1 \u226a 1. A tight bound of \u03b8(n log log n) is shown for many simple problems: reading each input, dot product, shuffle exchange, and merging two sorted lists. The same bound holds for transposing a \u221an \u00d7 \u221an matrix; we use this to compute an FFT graph in optimal \u03b8(n log n) time. An optimal \u03b8(n log n) sorting algorithm is also shown. Some additional issues considered are: maintaining data structures such as dictionaries, DAG simulation, and connections with PRAMs. Next we study the model f(x) = x. Using techniques similar to those developed for the previous model, we show tight bounds of \u03b8(n log n) for the simple problems mentioned above, and provide a new technique that yields optimal lower bounds of \u03a9(n log2n) for sorting, computing an FFT graph, and for matrix transposition.

There is a constant-round reduction from Byzantine Agreement to non-interactive VSS. Non-interactive VSS provides asynchronous networks with a constant-round simulation of simultaneous broadcast networks whenever even a bare majority of processors are good.

This paper contributes to the design methodology of efficient VLSI algorithms. We present a transformation that converts synchronous systems into more time-efficient, systolic implementations by removing combinational rippling. The problem of determining the optimized system can be reduced to the graph-theoretic single-destination-shortest-paths problem. More importantly from an engineering standpoint, however, the kinds of rippling that can be removed from a circuit at essentially no cost can be easily characterized. For example, if the only global communication in a system is broadcasting from the host computer, the broadcast can always be replaced by local communication.","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1981.34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1981.34","publicationTitle":"22nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1981)","displayPublicationTitle":"22nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1981)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568306/4568307/04568313.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing synchronous systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 1981","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing synchronous systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 1981","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing synchronous systems","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"542800023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025273S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 1981","isNumber":"4568307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568306","citationCount":"206","articleId":"4568313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4568320,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This disproves a conjecture by Shamos and Hoey that this problem requires \u03a9(n log n) time. An immediate consequence of the main result is that the problem of linear separability is solvable in linear-time. This corrects an error in Shamos and Hoey's paper, namely, that their O(n log n) algorithm for this problem in the plane was optimal. Also, a linear-time algorithm is given for the problem of finding the weighted center of a tree and algorithms for other common location-theoretic problems are indicated. The results apply also to the problem of convex quadratic programming in three-dimensions. The results have already been extended to higher dimensions and we know that linear programming can be solved in linear-time when the dimension is fixed. This will be reported elsewhere; a preliminary report is available from the author.","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1982)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568363/4568364/04568408.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"23rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1982)","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1982.24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1982.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear-time algorithms for linear programming in R3 and related problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Error correction","Quadratic programming","Computational geometry","Algorithm design and analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 1982","displayDocTitle":"Linear-time algorithms for linear programming in R3 and related problems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear-time algorithms for linear programming in R3 and related problems","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"542800329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047035S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 1982","isNumber":"4568364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568363","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4568408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4568441,"authors":[{"name":"Sunghwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37335999000"},{"name":"Min-Ho Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Ho","lastName":"Jang","id":"38187374700"},{"name":"Jong-Seon No","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Seon","lastName":"No","id":"37266106800"},{"name":"Song-Nam Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Song-Nam","lastName":"Hong","id":"37278993500"},{"name":"Dong-Joon Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Joon","lastName":"Shin","id":"37274958000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4568441","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568441","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Partitioning algorithms","Bit error rate","Iterative algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Equations","Floods","Convergence","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Gaussian processes","iterative decoding","message passing","parity check codes","sequential decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential message-passing decoding algorithm","LDPC codes","low-density parity-check code","partitioning check nodes","bit error rate","BER","iterative decoding","recursive equations","density evolution","Gaussian approximation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the sequential message- passing decoding algorithm of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by partitioning check nodes.

Analytical results indicate that as the number of partitioned subsets of check nodes increases, the BER performance is improved. We also derive the recursive equations for mean values of messages at check and variable nodes by using density evolution with a Gaussian approximation. From these equations, the mean values are obtained at each iteration of the sequential decoding algorithm and the corresponding BER values are calculated.

Both single-input single-output (SISO) systems and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal space-time block coding are considered. The proposed scheme is based on the reasonable assumption that the channel frequency response changes slowly in the frequency domain, which implies that the channel frequency response on two consecutive sub- carriers is approximately the same. Based on this assumption, cost functions are derived in closed-form, which minimize the difference between the signal power of two neighboring subcarriers. The identifiability of the proposed scheme is mathematically proved, which implies that minimizing the derived cost function gives an approximate estimate of the CFO. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides an excellent trade-off between complexity and performance as compared to prominent existing estimation schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4568439/04568442.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1037","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A blind carrier frequency offset estimation scheme for OFDM systems with constant modulus signaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"A blind carrier frequency offset estimation scheme for OFDM systems with constant modulus signaling","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4568442/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10173187","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A blind carrier frequency offset estimation scheme for OFDM systems with constant modulus signaling","sourcePdf":"tc_0807_1032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051449S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4568439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4568439","articleId":"4568442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4568443,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghua Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, China","Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Shi","id":"37307457000"},{"name":"Q.

However, it may be desirable to use transmitter- based techniques to improve the down-link capacity, since the implementation complexity is less critical at a base station (BS) than at a mobile station (MS). This paper presents a transmitter- based processing for the down-link direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) systems with multiple transmit antennas. We propose a combined pre-rake/pre-decorrelating approach. This approach combines the advantage of pre-rake scheme, to achieve diversity gain and average received signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) gain, with that of pre-decorrelating scheme, to suppress multiple access interference (MAI) and multipath interference (MPI). Furthermore, to make the total transmit power the same as that without pre-rake/pre-decorrelating processing, two power normalization methods are presented. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the conventional transmitter-based techniques. The effects of the number of users and the block size on the bit error rate (BER) performance are also investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4568439/04568445.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.040535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.040535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568439","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter-based processing for down-link DS/CDMA systems with multiple transmit antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Transmitting antennas","Diversity reception","Multiple access interference","Diversity methods","Radio transmitters","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication","Base stations","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","code division multiple access","decorrelation","diversity reception","error statistics","interference suppression","radio links","radio transmitters","spread spectrum communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple transmit antennas","down-link DS/CDMA systems","cellular wireless communication systems","transmitter-based processing","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","pre-rake approach","pre-decorrelating approach","multiple access interference suppression","multipath interference suppression","MAI","MPI","power normalization","bit error rate","BER","diversity reception"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter-based processing for down-link DS/CDMA systems with multiple transmit antennas","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4568445/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117815","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter-based processing for down-link DS/CDMA systems with multiple transmit antennas","sourcePdf":"tc_0807_1047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07047S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4568439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"4568439","articleId":"4568445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4568447,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Emre Pusane","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4568439/4568447/4568447-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Emre Pusane was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1978.

In this paper, we propose several reduced complexity decoding strategies to lessen the storage requirements and the initial decoding delay without significant loss in performance. We also provide bit error rate comparisons of LDPC block and LDPC convolutional codes under equal processor (hardware) complexity and equal decoding delay assumptions. A partial syndrome encoder realization for LDPC convolutional codes is also proposed and analyzed. We construct terminated LDPC convolutional codes that are suitable for block transmission over a wide range of frame lengths. Simulation results show that, for terminated LDPC convolutional codes of sufficiently large memory, performance can be improved by increasing the density of the syndrome former matrix.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4568439/04568447.pdf","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation aspects of LDPC convolutional codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Implementation aspects of LDPC convolutional codes","volume":"56","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4568447/","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117817","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568447/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation aspects of LDPC convolutional codes","sourcePdf":"tc_0807_1060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114946S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4568439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4568439","articleId":"4568447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4568450,"authors":[{"name":"Yindi Jing","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4568439/4568450/4568450-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yindi Jing received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in automatic control from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1996 and 1999.

With this scheme, antennas of the distributive relays work as transmit antennas of the sender and generate a space-time code at the receiver. It achieves the maximum diversity. Although the scheme needs no channel information at relays, it does require full channel information, both the channels from the transmitter to relays and the channels from relays to the receiver, at the receiver. In this paper, we propose a differential transmission scheme, which requires channel information at neither relays nor the receiver, for wireless relay networks. As distributed space-time coding can be seen as the counterpart of space-time coding in the network setting, this scheme is the counterpart of differential space-time coding. Compared to coherent distributed space-time coding, the differential scheme is 3dB worse. In addition, we show that Alamouti, square real orthogonal, and Sp(2) codes can be used differentially in networks with corresponding numbers of relays. We also propose distributed differential space-time codes that work for networks with any number of relays using circulant matrices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4568439/04568450.pdf","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568439","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed differential space-time coding for wireless relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Space time codes","Receiving antennas","Decoding","Digital relays","Fading","Wireless communication","Block codes","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","diversity reception","matrix algebra","orthogonal codes","radio networks","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed differential space-time coding","wireless relay networks","cooperative transmission scheme","channel coding","circulant matrix","Alamouti codes","square real orthogonal codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed differential space-time coding for wireless relay networks","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4568450/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117820","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed differential space-time coding for wireless relay networks","sourcePdf":"tc_0807_1092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057862S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4568439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4568439","articleId":"4568450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4568451,"authors":[{"name":"Pooi Yuen Kam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4568439/4568451/4568451-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pooi Yuen Kam [M '83, SM'87] was born in Ipoh, Malaysia in 1951, and educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., where he obtained the S.

This interpretation engenders a fruitful approach for deriving new representations and tight, upper and lower bounds on Q(a,b). The new representations obtained involve finite-range integrals with pure exponential integrands. They are shown to be simpler and more robust than their counterparts in the literature. The new bounds obtained include the generic exponential bounds which involve an arbitrarily large number of exponential functions, and the simple erfc bounds which involve just a few erfc functions, together with exponential functions in some cases. The new generic exponential bounds approach the exact value of Q(a,b) as the number of exponential terms involved increases. These generic exponential bounds evaluated with only two terms and the new simple erfc bounds are much tighter than the existing exponential bounds in most cases, especially when the arguments a and b are large.

We propose a method for jointly estimating the channel and CPE in a first step and removing ICI in a second step, using a power series expansion of the phase noise process.

This paper considers shaping for amplified direct-detection optical systems in which signal-spontaneous beat noise, a form of signal-dependent noise, is dominant.

Under a continuous approximation, as Nrarrinfin, the ultimate shape gain is 1.53 dB and the induced signaling distribution on the constituent 1-D constellation becomes half- Gaussian. In practice, the ultimate shape gain can be approached when the 1-D constellation follows a truncated half-Gaussian distribution.

We assume a Gaussian network model where (i) the data samples being sensed at different sensors have a correlated Gaussian distribution and the correlation matrix is known at the fusion center, (ii) the links between the local sensors and the fusion center are subject to fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and the fading gains are known at the fusion center, and (iii) the central node uses the squared error distortion metric. We consider two different distortion criteria: (i) individual distortion constraints at each node, and (ii) average mean square error distortion constraint across the network. We determine the achievable power-distortion regions under each distortion constraint. Taking the delay constraint into account, we investigate the performance of an uncoded transmission strategy where the noisy observations are only scaled and transmitted to the fusion center. At the fusion center, two different estimators are considered: (i) the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) that does not require knowledge of the correlation matrix, and (ii) the minimum mean- square error (MMSE) estimator that exploits the correlations. For each estimation method, we determine the optimal power allocation that results in a minimum total transmission power while satisfying some distortion level for the estimate (under both distortion criteria). The numerical comparisons between the two schemes indicate that the MMSE estimator requires less power to attain the same distortion provided by the BLUE and this performance gap becomes more dramatic as correlations between the observations increase. Furthermore, comparisons between power-distortion region achieved by the theoretically optimum system and that achieved by the uncoded system indicate that the performance gap between the two systems becomes small for low levels of correlation between the sensor observations. If observations at all sensor nodes are uncorrelated, the uncoded system with MMSE estimator attains the theoretically optimum system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4568439/04568456.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568439","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear estimation of correlated data in wireless sensor networks with optimum power allocation and analog modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear estimation of correlated data in wireless sensor networks with optimum power allocation and analog modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117825","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4568456/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear estimation of correlated data in wireless sensor networks with optimum power allocation and analog modulation","sourcePdf":"tc_0807_1146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127329S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4568439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4568439","articleId":"4568456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4568458,"authors":[{"name":"Yossef Rahamim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4568439/4568458/4568458-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yossef Rahamim (M'05) was born in Israel, in 1974.

Turbo codes enable the operation at low SNR, close to the Shannon limit. However, carrier frequency and phase synchronization, needed for optimal coherent performance of the receiver, still remains a problem in low SNR and short bursts conditions. This paper proposes a new carrier synchronization method, the Maximum-Likelihood Iterative-Soft-Decision-Directed (ML-ISDD), which uses the turbo-decoder soft decisions to improve the carrier synchronization performance at low SNR values. The ML-ISDD method operates iteratively and jointly with the turbo decoder, enhancing both the turbo-decoder and the synchronization performance. The ML-ISDD method has been shown by simulation to significantly increase the allowed initial frequency and phase uncertainty region, thus allowing the use of very short training sequences for initial carrier synchronization.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.040598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4568439/04568458.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.040598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568439","startPage":"1169","endPage":"1177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML iterative soft-decision-directed (ML-ISDD): a carrier synchronization system for short packet turbo coded communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ML iterative soft-decision-directed (ML-ISDD): a carrier synchronization system for short packet turbo coded communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117827","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4568458/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML iterative soft-decision-directed (ML-ISDD): a carrier synchronization system for short packet turbo coded communication","sourcePdf":"tc_0807_1169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04384S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4568439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4568439","articleId":"4568458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4568460,"authors":[{"name":"Shahrokh Valaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4568439/4568460/4568460-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahrokh Valaee (S88,M00,SM02) received the Ph.D. degree from McGill University, Montreal, in Electrical Engineering.

The approach is based on the predictive description length (PDL) of the observation vector. The PDL is the length of a predictive code of observations. For signal detection, the PDL criterion is computed for the candidate models and is minimized to determine the number of signals. The proposed technique uses the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the correlation matrix. The only information used in the ML estimation of the correlation matrix is the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue. The PDL algorithm has a signal-to-noise ratio resolution threshold that is smaller than that of the minimum description length (MDL).

Though the well-known frequent pattern mining attracted much attention in research community, recently, more work has been devoted to analysis of more sophisticated relationships among items. Chow-Liu tree and low-entropy tree, for example, were used to summarize the frequent patterns. In this paper, we consider finding a novel dependency tree from binary data. It has several advantages over previous related work. Firstly, we propose a novel distance measure between items based on information theory, which captures the expected uncertainty in the item pairs and the mutual information between them. Based on this distance measure, we present a simple yet efficient algorithm for finding the dependency trees from binary data. We also show how our new approach can find applications in frequent pattern summarization. Our running example on synthetic dataset shows that our approach achieves good results compared to existing popular heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2008.Workshops.92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2008.Workshops.92","startPage":"80","endPage":"85","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 8th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568461/4568462/04568483.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 8th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology Workshops","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4568462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding Dependency Trees from Binary Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Finding Dependency Trees from Binary Data","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4568483/","accessionNumber":"10089818","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568483/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding Dependency Trees from Binary Data","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3242a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06136S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568461","isNumber":"4568462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568461","xplore-issue":"4568462","articleId":"4568483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4568485,"authors":[{"name":"Thi Hong Nhan Vu","affiliation":["Database Bioinformatics Laboratory, Chungbuk National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Thi Hong Nhan","lastName":"Vu","id":"38257736300"},{"name":"Jun Wook Lee","affiliation":["RFID USN Research Division, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun Wook","lastName":"Lee","id":"38258739400"},{"name":"Yongmi Lee","affiliation":["Database Bioinformatics Laboratory, Chungbuk National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongmi","lastName":"Lee","id":"37311311200"},{"name":"Hiseok Kim","affiliation":["Division of Electronic & Information Engineering, Cheongju University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hiseok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37310760700"},{"name":"Keun Ho Ryu","affiliation":["Database Bioinformatics Laboratory, Chungbuk National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Keun Ho","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37306876400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3242-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4568485","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart rate variability","Neural networks","Medical services","Wireless sensor networks","Electrocardiography","Wearable sensors","Adaptive systems","Heart rate detection","Cardiac disease","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["health care","mobile computing","neural nets","wearable computers","Web services","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","mobile healthcare services","implantable devices","ECG","movement sensors","wireless sensor network","incremental adaptive network","coronary heart disease","heart rate variability measurement","blood pressure","breathing frequency","Poincare plot encoding","error probability density","classification error","network structure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4568485","abstract":"Implantable devices such as pulse, ECG, and movement sensors that can be embedded in day to day wearables have been drawn a lot of research attentions in the field of wireless sensor network nowadays.

The network is learnt along with the various changes of environment without destroying the old prototype patterns. The error probability density is taken care in the training process, which is necessary to avoid the regions where inputs have a high temporary probability density attracting all neural units. PHIAN is evaluated under different settings and in comparison with previous on-line learning techniques in terms of classification error and the network structure.

Instead of number of integrated devices number of processed, uncoded data per square centimeter per second was suggested as a measure of integrated circuit complexity. A model of logic gate was proposed based on additive white gaussian noise channel. From the model it is evident that we are in transition from band-limited regime of hardware operation to power-limited regime. Power limited regime is characterized by massive appearance of thermal noise hardware malfunctions.

Since most of the embedded systems are multi-tasking real time systems, the task interleaving issues, dead lines and other factors needs software units retesting to follow the subsequence changes. Regression testing is used for the software maintenance that revalidates the old functionality of the software unit. Testing is one of the most complex and time-consuming activities, in which running of all combination of test cases in test suite may require a large amount of efforts. Test case prioritization techniques can take advantage that orders test cases, which attempts to increase effectiveness in regression testing. This paper proposes to use particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to prioritize the test cases automatically based on the modified software units. Regarding to the recent investigations, PSO is a multi-object optimization technique that can find out the best positions of the objects. The goal is to prioritize the test cases to the new best order, based on modified software components, so that test cases, which have new higher priority, can be selected in the regression testing process. The empirical results show that by using the PSO algorithm, the test cases can be prioritized in the test suites with their new best positions effectively and efficiently.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4568558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10089884","htmlLink":"/document/4568558/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Applying Particle Swarm Optimization to Prioritizing Test Cases for Embedded Real Time Software Retesting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Particle Swarm Optimization to Prioritizing Test Cases for Embedded Real Time Software Retesting","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3242a527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048697S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568461","isNumber":"4568462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568461","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4568462","articleId":"4568558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4569362,"authors":[{"name":"Bashir I.

For practical implementation of STB code, the receiver requires to estimate these parameters. Regarding this type of estimation, the inherent orthogonal nature of STB code can be exploited to simplify multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation technique. While modified decision-directed iterative channel estimation updates estimated parameters throughout the frame, proposed frame-based iterative channel estimation technique updates estimated channel parameters once in each iteration after decoding the whole frame. This modification reduces the effect of incorrect detection significantly. Simulation results show about 1 dB gain of bit error rate over the state-of-the-art method. The proposed scheme uses few pilot symbols to provide near perfect lower-bound performance at the cost of increased receiver complexity.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2004.4569362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569353","startPage":"26","endPage":"32","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557990/4569353/04569362.pdf","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE Electro/Information Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE Electro/Information Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2004.4569362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frame-based iterative channel estimation using data symbols of space-time block codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Block codes","Parameter estimation","US Department of Transportation","MIMO","Iterative methods","Fading","Iterative decoding","Gain","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","decoding","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame-based iterative channel estimation","data symbols","space-time block codes","channel fading parameters estimation","data sequence","orthogonal code","multiple-input-multiple-output","MIMO","decoding","bit error rate","state-of-the-art method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Frame-based iterative channel estimation using data symbols of space-time block codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569362/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4569362/","accessionNumber":"10230530","publicationDate":"Aug. 2004","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frame-based iterative channel estimation using data symbols of space-time block codes","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068355S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"4557990","isNumber":"4569353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557990","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4569353","articleId":"4569362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4569379,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsong Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Jinsong Wang","id":"37280533900"},{"name":"Nilesh Patel","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Michigan, Dearborn, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Nilesh","lastName":"Patel","id":"38183089400"},{"name":"William Grosky","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Michigan, Dearborn, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Grosky","id":"37267130900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7803-8750-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7803-8751-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4569379","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Interpolation","Video sequences","Motion estimation","Image converters","Image segmentation","Motion analysis","Merging","Computer science","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image matching","image segmentation","interpolation","motion compensation","nonlinear estimation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated video frame rate up conversion","region based motion compensation","video temporal interpolation","region extraction","image segmentation","frame region merging technique","nonlinear estimation model","heuristic technique","block matching algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["temporal interpolation","motion compensation","watershed","region matching","Levernberg-Marquadt Algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Video frame rate conversion is often recognized as video temporal interpolation.

Since this step involves image segmentation, the resulting regions are under or over segmented. Consistent frame to frame region extraction is key to region based motion compensation. We propose a novel inter- and intra-frame region merging technique to compensate for inconsistent frame segmentation problem. The video frame rate is then up converted using the motion compensation and region interpolation between every pair of matching regions. The deformation parameters of the match region pair are estimated based on a non-linear estimation model.

This compensation allows for the use of different chip pulse shapes. The compensation is based on the incorporation of priors derived from the FFT of the pulse shape. The system employs detectors that incorporate methods of independent component analysis (ICA), subspace estimation of channel noise, and Hopfield type neural networks. Several chip pulse shapes are tested, including the cosine, raised cosine, and the duobinary shapes, which are the pulse shapes that provide superior performance with more traditional detectors. They do not retain this superior performance when used with the uncompensated ICA detectors operating in a multipath fading channel environment. When compensated, the ICA neural network detectors displayed significantly better bit error rate performance than traditional detectors and the uncompensated ICA detectors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE Electro/Information Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557990/4569353/04569391.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE Electro/Information Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2004.4569391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2004.4569391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4569391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporation of prior knowledge of chip shapes in blind multiuser detection for DS-CDMA communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Independent component analysis","Pulse shaping methods","Fading","Neural networks","Multipath channels","Multi-stage noise shaping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","Hopfield neural nets","independent component analysis","multipath channels","multiuser detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind multiuser detection","DS-CDMA communication","direct sequence code division multiple access","multipath fading channel","chip pulse shapes","FFT","fast Fourier transforms","ICA","independent component analysis","channel noise estimation","Hopfield type neural networks","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Incorporation of prior knowledge of chip shapes in blind multiuser detection for DS-CDMA communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4569391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2004","accessionNumber":"10230555","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporation of prior knowledge of chip shapes in blind multiuser detection for DS-CDMA communication","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07112008-00038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074634S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"4557990","isNumber":"4569353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557990","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4569353","articleId":"4569391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4569539,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We prove that, counting one operation as a unit of time and considering the machines as acceptors, deterministic and nondeterministic polynomial time acceptable languages are the same, and are exactly the languages recognizable in polynomial tape by Turing machines. We observe that the same measure on machines without multiplication is polynomially related to Turing machine time-thus the added computational power due to multiplication in random access machines is equivalent to the computational power which polynomially tape-bounded Turing machine computations have over polynomially time-bounded computations. Therefore, in this formulation, it is not harder to multiply than to add if and only if PTAPE = PTIME for Turing machines. We also discuss other instruction sets for random access machines and their computational power.","doi":"10.1109/SWAT.1974.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SWAT.1974.20","publicationTitle":"15th Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (swat 1974)","displayPublicationTitle":"15th Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (swat 1974)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569747/4569748/04569753.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the power of multiplication in random access machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 1974","displayDocTitle":"On the power of multiplication in random access machines","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 1974","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 1974","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the power of multiplication in random access machines","confLoc":"USA","sourcePdf":"4569753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022465S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 1974","isNumber":"4569748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569747","citationCount":"40","articleId":"4569753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4569763,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, if such a circuit is designed by a direct extension of the theory of two-stage circuits using AND Gates and OR Gates. the result- will not be an efficient circuit. In order to design such NOR gate circuits efficiently it is necessary to modify the design techniques so that the third stage gates (those driven directly by the inputs) are. chosen properly. In partioular, it is necessary to allow for the possibility that a gate realizing. a function such as a1 + b1 be used in realizing the function ab1 + a1b as a(a1+b1) + b(a1+b1) rather than two separate gates to generate a1 and b1. A general technique for the design of such circuits is presented in this paper.

The set of flow tables is combined into a single composite table from which the optimum test sequence is found. Use of a composite table has the advantage that all possible sequences of input symbols need not be investigated. A large class of sequences which cannot possibly lead to an optimum test is easily recognized and discarded.","doi":"10.1109/SWCT.1964.7","publicationTitle":"1964 Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design","displayPublicationTitle":"1964 Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569796/4569797/04569813.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SWCT.1964.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569797","startPage":"121","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Derivation of optimum test sequencies for sequential machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4569813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Derivation of optimum test sequencies for sequential machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569813/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 1964","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1964","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Derivation of optimum test sequencies for sequential machines","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054402S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 1964","isNumber":"4569797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569796","citationCount":"46","articleId":"4569813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4569814,"authors":[{"name":"Bernard Elspas","affiliation":["Stanford Research Institute, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Elspas","id":"37332253500"}],"articleNumber":"4569814","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4569814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topological constraints on interconnection-limited logic","abstract":"Consideration is given to the manner and extent to which propagation delay and terminal packing factors may constrain the interconnection of modules making up large digital network. When formulated in graph-theoretical terms these considerations give rise to the problem of finding linear graphs with a maximum number, n, of nodes for a given degree, d, and diameter, k--a generalization of the problem of finding Moore graphs. A number of inequalities are derived that serve to delimit the function n(d, k), although its precise law of growth remains unknown. Maximal graphs have been found for several cases where Moore graphs are known not to exist. Finally, several interesting techniques are demonstrated for constructing families of graphs, which, though the are usually submaximal, possess a useful regularity of structure.","doi":"10.1109/SWCT.1964.27","publicationTitle":"1964 Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design","startPage":"133","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SWCT.1964.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569797","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569796/4569797/04569814.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"1964 Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic","Integrated circuit interconnections","Propagation delay","Impedance","Digital systems","Image storage","Relays","Circuit synthesis","Cooling","Wires"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Topological constraints on interconnection-limited logic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569814/","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 1964","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 1964","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topological constraints on interconnection-limited logic","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.01491S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 1964","isNumber":"4569797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569796","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4569814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4569828,"authors":[{"name":"Sergei A.

The proposed model is very general and can be applied for solution of a variety of problems. The motion patterns of objects in the scene are modeled in the form of a multivariate nonparametric probability density function of spatiotemporal variables (object locations and transition times between them). Kernel Density Estimation is used to learn this model in a completely unsupervised fashion. Learning is accomplished by observing the trajectories of objects by a static camera over extended periods of time. It encodes the probabilistic nature of the behavior of moving objects in the scene and is useful for activity analysis applications, such as persistent tracking and anomalous motion detection. In addition, the model also captures salient scene features, such as the areas of occlusion and most likely paths. Once the model is learned, we use a unified Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based framework for generating the most likely paths in the scene, improving foreground detection, persistent labeling of objects during tracking, and deciding whether a given trajectory represents an anomaly to the observed motion patterns. Experiments with real-world videos are reported which validate the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Modeling of Scene Dynamics for Applications in Visual Surveillance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.175","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5109415/04569848.pdf","startPage":"1472","endPage":"1485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4569848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Modeling of Scene Dynamics for Applications in Visual Surveillance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4569848/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10721308","pubMedId":"19542580","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Modeling of Scene Dynamics for Applications in Visual Surveillance","sourcePdf":"ttp2009081472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080686S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5109415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5109415","articleId":"4569848","onlineDate":"18 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4569861,"authors":[{"name":"Chanki Kim","affiliation":["Department ofMechanical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4598893/4569861/4569861-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chanki Kim (S'07) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering, in 2005 from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, where, he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include mobile robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), path planning, and integrated exploration."]},"firstName":"Chanki","lastName":"Kim","id":"38256658600"},{"name":"Rathinasamy Sakthivel","affiliation":["Department ofMechanical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4598893/4569861/4569861-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Rathinasamy Sakthivel received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, India, in 1992, 1994, and 1999, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea.

These can make the filter inconsistent. Another challenge is to reduce the number of particles while maintaining the estimation accuracy. This paper provides a robust new algorithm based on the scaled unscented transformation called unscented FastSLAM (UFastSLAM). It overcomes the important drawbacks of the previous frameworks by directly using nonlinear relations. This approach improves the filter consistency and state estimation accuracy, and requires smaller number of particles than the FastSLAM approach. Simulation results in large-scale environments and experimental results with a benchmark dataset are presented, demonstrating the superiority of the UFastSLAM algorithm.","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4598893/04569861.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.924946","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.924946","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4569861","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Particle filters","Jacobian matrices","Linear approximation","Large-scale systems","Proposals","Vehicles","Sampling methods","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Kalman filters","mobile robots","particle filtering (numerical methods)","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unscented FastSLAM","Rao-Blackwellized particle filter","Jacobian matrices","linear approximations","nonlinear functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FastSLAM","improved proposal distribution","Jacobian","linearization","Rao--Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)","scaled unscented transformation (SUT)","simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)","unscented Kalman filter (UKF)","unscented particle filter (UPF)"]},{"kwd":["FastSLAM","improved proposal distribution","Jacobian","linearization","Rao--Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)","scaled unscented transformation (SUT)","simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)","unscented Kalman filter (UKF)","unscented particle filter (UPF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Unscented FastSLAM: A Robust and Efficient Solution to the SLAM Problem","accessionNumber":"10144722","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4569861/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unscented FastSLAM: A Robust and Efficient Solution to the SLAM Problem","sourcePdf":"24tro04-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108824S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4598893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"4598893","articleId":"4569861","onlineDate":"18 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4569869,"authors":[{"name":"Saket Srivastava","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Saket Srivastava (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Regional Engineering College, Trichy, India, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of South Florida, Tampa, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","His research interests include Nano-CAD tools, reliability centric Nano-CMOS, and VLSI design automation."]},"firstName":"Saket","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"38587598000"},{"name":"Sanjukta Bhanja","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sanjukta Bhanja (S'01\u2013M'03) received the B.E. degree from Jadavpur University, Calcutta, West Bengal, India, the M.Sc.(eng.) degree from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of South Florida (USF), Tampa.","Since 2002, she has been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at USF.

The accuracy of explicit positioning sensors such as GPS is often limited for indoor environments. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of building an indoor location tracking system that is cost effective for large scale deployments, can operate over existing Wi-Fi networks, and can provide flexibility to accommodate new sensor observations as they become available. At the core of our system is a novel location and tracking algorithm using a sigma-point Kalman smoother (SPKS) based Bayesian inference approach. The proposed SPKS fuses a predictive model of human walking with a number of low-cost sensors to track 2D position and velocity. Available sensors include Wi-Fi received signal strength indication (RSSI), binary infrared (IR) motion sensors, and binary foot-switches. Wi-Fi signal strength is measured using a receiver tag developed by Ekahau Inc. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with a commercially available positioning engine, also developed by Ekahau Inc. The superior accuracy of our approach over a number of trials is demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.2008.4569985","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557992/4569960/04569985.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.2008.4569985","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","startPage":"646","endPage":"659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wi-Fi based indoor localization and tracking using sigma-point Kalman filtering methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4569985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Wi-Fi based indoor localization and tracking using sigma-point Kalman filtering methods","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569985/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4569985/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10186580","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wi-Fi based indoor localization and tracking using sigma-point Kalman filtering methods","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07142008-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076242S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4557992","isNumber":"4569960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557992","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4569960","articleId":"4569985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4569992,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The paper proposes multi system solution which utilizes navigation and communication systems and signals. The experimental software receiver is described as development tool of such combined system. The proposed receiver consist of three GNSS RF front ends of bandwidth of 24 MHz tunable to any navigation frequency from 1 to 2 GHz and one DVB-T(H) tuner. The programmable receiver hardware is based on FPGA and PC workstation which communicate each other via Gigabit Ethernet. In the second part of this paper we are presenting methods of estimation of time of arrival of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) signal. Described estimation algorithm is used in the DVB-T(H) (Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial) receiver which can be used for navigation or for support of satellite navigation receivers. The last part of this paper describes our results of experiments with DVB-T(H) navigation. They were obtained in various environments (urban, suburban, etc.) including indoor environment.","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.2008.4569992","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4557992/4569960/04569992.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.2008.4569992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4569960","startPage":"860","endPage":"864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi system navigation receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4569992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi system navigation receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4569992/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10186610","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4569992/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi system navigation receiver","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-07142008-00032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046736S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4557992","isNumber":"4569960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557992","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4569960","articleId":"4569992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
