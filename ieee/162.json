Exploiting the inherent parallelism between sequences is a common strategy. In this paper we enhance both the fine-grained and course-grained parallelism within the HMMER sequence analysis suite. Our strategies are complementary to one another and, where necessary, can be used as drop-in replacements to the strategies already provided within HMMER. We use conventional processors (Intel Pentium IV Xeon) as well as the freely available MPICH parallel programming environment. Our results show that the MPICH implementation greatly outperforms the PVM HMMER implementation, and our SSE2 implementation also lends greater computational power at no cost to the user.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2006.68","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10777/33943/01620206.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2006.68","publicationTitle":"20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)","startPage":"6 pp.","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating the HMMER sequence analysis suite using conventional processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1620206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating the HMMER sequence analysis suite using conventional processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620206/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1620206/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8978581","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating the HMMER sequence analysis suite using conventional processors","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"01620206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124049S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10777","isNumber":"33943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10777","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33943","articleId":"1620206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1620230,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This scheme is applied when the user experiences real time multimedia content. Rate control is an important issue in video streaming applications for both wired and wireless networks. A widely accepted rate control method in wired networks is equation based rate control. In this work, we focus on a mechanism for equation based congestion control for video transmission over WCDMA networks. With our mechanism, the sender explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of the measured rate of loss events, the round trip time and the packet size. Furthermore, we examine the performance of UMTS air interface for real time video transmission using real time protocols, through a number of experiments.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2006.173","publicationTitle":"20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10777/33943/01620230.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2006.173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33943","startPage":"6 pp.","endPage":"450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equation based congestion control for video transmission over WCDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1620230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Equation based congestion control for video transmission over WCDMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620230/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8978605","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1620230/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equation based congestion control for video transmission over WCDMA networks","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"01620230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104204S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10777","isNumber":"33943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10777","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33943","articleId":"1620230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1620233,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-hung Liu","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-hung Liu","id":"37087219885"},{"name":"Tzu-Chiang Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Hsing Kuo University of Management, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tzu-Chiang Chiang","id":"37087262640"},{"name":"Yueh-Min Huang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yueh-Min Huang","id":"37087255095"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2466-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"1620233","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile ad hoc networks","Genetic algorithms","Multicast protocols","Encoding","Network topology","Routing","Broadcasting","Ad hoc networks","Tree data structures","Tree graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","ad hoc networks","multicast protocols","routing protocols","tree codes","trees (mathematics)","genetic algorithms","sequences","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad hoc network","multicast tree structure","tree graph optimization problem","GOP","NP-hard problem","NP-complete problem","multicast routing protocol","tree encoding","Prufer encoding","GAP","hybrid genetic algorithm","sequence","topology encoding","GAST"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1620233","abstract":"Multicast routing is an effective way to communicate among multiple hosts in a network. It outperforms the basic broadcast strategy by sharing resources along general links, while sending information to a set of predefined multiple destinations concurrently. However, it is vulnerable to component failure in ad hoc network due to the lack of redundancy, multiple paths and multicast tree structure. Tree graph optimization problems (GOP) are usually difficult and time consuming NP-hard or NP-complete problems. Genetic algorithms (GA) have been proven to be an efficient technique for solving the GOP, in which well-designed chromosomes and appropriate operators are key factors that determine the performance of the GAs. Limited link, path constraints, and mobility of network hosts make the multicast routing protocol design particularly challenging in wireless ad hoc networks. Encoding trees is a critical scheme in GAs for solving these problems because each code should represent a tree. Prufer number is the most representative method of vertex encoding, which is a string of n-2 integers and can be transformed to an n-node tree. However, genetic algorithm based on Prufer encoding (GAP) does not preserve locality, while changing one element of its vector causes dramatically change in its corresponding tree topology. In this paper, we propose a novel GA based on sequence and topology encoding (GAST) for multicast protocol is introduced for multicast routing in wireless ad hoc networks and generalizes the GOP of tree-based multicast protocol as well as three associated operators. It has revealed an efficient method of the reconstruction of multicast tree topology and the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of GAST compare to GAP technique.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2006.39","pdfPath":"/iel5/10777/33943/01620233.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","endPage":"470","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)","publicationTitle":"20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2006.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A near-optimal multicast scheme for mobile ad hoc networks using a hybrid genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"A near-optimal multicast scheme for mobile ad hoc networks using a hybrid genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","accessionNumber":"8978608","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1620233/","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A near-optimal multicast scheme for mobile ad hoc networks using a hybrid genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Vienna","sourcePdf":"01620233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048161S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10777","isNumber":"33943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10777","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33943","articleId":"1620233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1620235,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.R.

Among different mobile location estimation methods, the one which estimates the location of mobile stations with reference to the wave propagation model is drawing much attention on the grounds that it is applicable to different kinds of cellular network. However the estimation accuracy of the signal propagation model deteriorates as the distance between the mobile station and the receiving base station increases. In view of this, we have designed a New Location Estimation Approach which has divided the location estimation into two phases, the Data Collection Phase and the Location Estimation Phase. In this paper, we report our study of the New Location Estimation Approach. We tested the approach with real life data collected from a major mobile operator of Hong Kong. Results show that the New Location Estimation Approach has improved the existing statistical signal propagation model by 30.94%. This improvement can be further enhanced if more data are collected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620306/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1620306/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9084811","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach for Locating Mobile Stations under the Statistical Directional Propagation Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach for Locating Mobile Stations under the Statistical Directional Propagation Model","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"01620306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077547S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10777","isNumber":"33943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10777","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33943","articleId":"1620306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1620384,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chunlin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Li Chunlin","id":"37296490200"},{"name":"Li Layuan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Li Layuan","id":"37298606100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2466-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"1620384","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1620384","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Grid computing","Quality of service","Optimal scheduling","Resource management","Web services","Computer science","Environmental management","Costs","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","optimisation","quality of service","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS resource scheduling model","quality of service","task agent optimization","resource agent optimization","resource allocation","grid computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QoS","optimal scheduling","grid computing"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents multiple QoS-based grid resource scheduling models and solves the scheduling problems using optimization techniques. Each of grid task agent's diverse requirements is modeled as a quality of service (QoS) dimension, associated with each QoS dimension is a utility function that defines the benefit that is perceived by a user with respect to QoS choices in that dimension. The paper proposes the idea of decomposing a global optimization problem in multiple QoS based resource scheduling into two subproblems: task agent optimization and resource agent optimization.

However, multi-hop communications is very sensitive to the time variability of fading and the snapping shrimp dominated ambient noise in the harsh underwater environment because a broken link in the multi-hop path is enough to disrupt the communications and initiate new route searches. We analyze the theoretical MAC throughput of the network using the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol with Poisson distributed, constant length packet arrivals at the application layer. We consider horizontal communications of sensors operating in shallow water near coastal regions. Previous empirical studies show that we can model the UWA channel as a slow-varying Rayleigh fading and frequency non-selective channel. The optimal throughput performance of the network under various operating conditions is then examined.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2006.156","publicationTitle":"20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10777/33944/01620408.pdf","startPage":"5 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2006.156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS/CDMA throughput of multi-hop sensor network in a Rayleigh fading underwater acoustic channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DS/CDMA throughput of multi-hop sensor network in a Rayleigh fading underwater acoustic channel","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","accessionNumber":"8986913","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1620408/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620408/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2006","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS/CDMA throughput of multi-hop sensor network in a Rayleigh fading underwater acoustic channel","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"01620408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09149S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10777","isNumber":"33944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10777","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33944","articleId":"1620408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1620410,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to derive the optimum path of a sink node in a fixed network of sensor nodes considering practical difficulties such as the limitation in the sink movement. The proposed evolutionary computing technique based simulator PSO-SIMSENS is an integrated system of particle swarm optimization and a sensor network simulator with an appropriate fitness function.

A new frequency offsets estimation algorithm based on the combination of ESPRIT (estimation of signal parameters by rotational invariance techniques) and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation methods for OFDMA system is proposed. The subset of the frequency offsets is first estimated by ESPRIT then the frequency offset of each user is identified in the subset by ML estimation method. The complexity of the combination algorithm is significantly decreased compared with the ML estimator.

This makes it difficult to use this technology in high power level conversion. This paper presents a new design method for dc-dc converter with flying capacitor technology. The new method can reduce the high pulse current which usually causes serious problem in traditional converters. Therefore the power level of this new designed converter can be extended to 1 kW or even higher. A 1 kW 42/14 V flying capacitor converter was designed for 42 V automotive system.

This paper introduces a novel hybrid parallel active power filter (APF), in which the passive power filter (PPF) and the transformer-coupled APF connected in series. In the proposed hybrid APF, there is a trade-off between compensation performance and system investment. Traditionally, the parameters of the LC filter and APF are decided in an approximate and experience-dependent way. In this paper, an overall optimization design strategy is proposed aiming to reduce the system cost with the same power factor and THD requirements of the supply. Firstly, the models of PPFs and the APF are established respectively for rating evaluation. Secondly, the objective function of the whole investment in the parallel system is obtained based on assumed unit price of the resistors, reactors, capacitors and APF. These coefficients can be modified easily according to different prices for different components. Finally, the minimum value of the objective function is found out through a genetic algorithm (GA). With the parameters based on GA overall optimization strategy, the whole cost of the system decreased about 2.26 percent with less computation and better compensation behavior comparing with traditional design method. The novel hybrid APF is applied in an arc furnace.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620530/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8946774","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1620530/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","conferenceDate":"19-23 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An overall optimization strategy for novel hybrid parallel active power filters based on genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overall optimization strategy for novel hybrid parallel active power filters based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Dallas, TX","sourcePdf":"01620530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104684S","chronDate":"19-23 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10769","isNumber":"33947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10769","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33947","articleId":"1620530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1620531,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The converter operates with a tiny chip-size inductor. Based on the physical behavior of the inductor a very robust power stage will be shown, which can service an unlimited number of positive and negative output channels with a single inductor. All the different voltage levels (positive and negative) will be regulated independently on a cycle by cycle base. There are two different types of regulation loops running in the converter. The control of the individual channels is managed by a state machine (first loop) which takes care of the power stage switching pattern and allows the hysteretic converter to run in a pseudo continuous current mode to guarantee a high power conversion capability. The second loop works as a variable peak current control to minimize the inductor current. It will be demonstrated why running with a controlled peak current also yields in a small output voltage ripple and how the state-machine can help to further control the amount of energy delivered into one output channel. To achieve even lower ripple voltages below 10mV and high accuracy the main output is post-regulated by a tracking current-mode LDO. Finally the whole TPS6512X architecture with the multi-output converter, LDO's and control circuitry will be shown. The converter with 4.5ksqmil chip-size fits in a 16-pin 3/spl times/3 QFN package. Due to the high maximum switching frequency of the device a single, inexpensive and ultra-thin 10/spl mu/H inductor can be used, which offers a very compact and small power supply solution to provide all voltage levels required by small form-factor TFT-LCD panels.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2006.1620531","publicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

Increasing the control bandwidth and switching frequency in order to avoid this effect would reduce converter efficiency and is objectionable. The paper presents the leading-phase admittance cancellation (LPAC) technique, which improves the current-shaping control structure and eliminates the current phase lead without increasing the bandwidth requirement. The LPAC method extends the allowable line frequency range from 1/150 to 1/5 of the current loop bandwidth. The LPAC method is load-invariant and superior to other previously proposed methods. The LPAC network can be added to existing designs, which would require only two passive components in the simplest case.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2006.1620549","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

Due to improvement in luminous efficiency, long life and wide color gamut, LED has gradually substituted for cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) as back light. In order to compete with other display devices and receive wide acceptance in the commercial arena, back-light driving efficiency, luminous efficiency and LED arrangement need to further improve. In this paper, an LED bypass circuit is proposed to prevent LED arrays from open-circuit, improving back-light reliability and availability significantly. In addition, bi-directional buck+boost converters are adopted to speed up state transition when using a current-type burst-mode dimming control for LED back-light drivers. Moreover, an effective driving circuit for achieving RGB light scan is introduced. Simulated and measured results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed driving system.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2006.1620566","publicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

The designed Z-source NPC inverter uses two unique X-shaped LC impedance networks connected between two isolated dc input power sources and its inverter circuitry for boosting its ac output voltage. Through the design of an appropriate pulse-width modulation (PWM) algorithm, the two impedance networks can be short-circuited sequentially (without shooting through the inverter full dc link) for implementing the \"nearest three vectors\" (NTV) modulation principle with minimized harmonic distortion and device commutations per half carrier cycle, while performing voltage-boosting. With only a slight modification to the inverter PWM algorithm and by short-circuiting the two LC impedance networks simultaneously, the designed NPC inverter, with no requirement for dead-time delay, can also be operated with completely eliminated common-mode voltage. Implementation-wise, detailed vectorial analysis interestingly shows that the same generic set of carrier-based modulation expressions can be used for controlling Z-source two-level inverter and NPC inverter with and without reduced common-mode (RCM) switching. All findings presented in the paper have been confirmed in simulation and experimentally using an implemented laboratory prototype.","publicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

With a unique X-shaped LC network connected between its dc power source and inverter topology, Z-source current-type inverter is however expected to suffer from compounded resonant complications in addition to those associated with its second-order output filter. To improve its damping performance, this paper proposes the careful integration of Posicast or three-step compensators before the inverter pulse-width modulator for damping triggered resonant oscillations. In total, two compensators are needed for wave-shaping the inverter boost factor and modulation ratio, and they can conveniently be implemented using first-in first-out stacks and embedded timers of modern digital signal processors widely used in motion control applications. Both techniques are found to damp resonance of ac filter well, but for cases of transiting from current-buck to boost state, three-step technique is less effective due to the sudden intermediate discharging interval introduced by its nonmonotonic stepping (unlike the monotonic stepping of Posicast damping). These findings have been confirmed both in simulations and experiments using an implemented laboratory prototype.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2006.1620628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.2006.1620628","startPage":"7 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

The design of high performance control algorithms for DVR control with improved robustness and desirable steady-state and transient characteristics is therefore an important area of study. In this paper, two voltage controllers are proposed on the stationary frame (with embedded inner current loops) for DVR voltage regulation. A P+resonant controller is first designed to achieve good positive- and negative-sequence fundamental voltage control with the virtue of having high gains around positive- and negative-sequence fundamental frequencies. Complex stationary-to-synchronous frame transformations carried out in traditional synchronous P1 regulators are no longer required with this method. However, with the purpose of achieving explicit robustness in face of parameter variations, an Hinfin controller is also designed. Detailed design procedure is presented to show how an Hinfin controller with high gains around plusmn50 Hz can be synthesized through careful selection of its weighting functions. A thorough discussion and performance comparison of these two controllers in both transient and steady-state conditions is also carried out. Finally, both controllers are extensively tested on a laboratory 10 kV DVR system with various voltage sags and loading conditions. It is shown that both controllers would respond properly for unbalanced voltage sags. With linear loads, both controllers perform well with slight difference during startup transient. The performance of the robust HaD controller becomes more obvious with nonlinear loads due to its better attenuation of the high frequency harmonic distortion","publicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

The proposed inverter results from the parallel connection of four class D LC/sub p/ resonant inverters, sharing the total load current. In this way, the conduction losses are reduced and high frequency operation is achieved for high power lamps. The power control is implemented at constant frequency, modifying the phase displacement among the output voltage of each inverter section. Considering that the deviation of the operation point caused by the control action deteriorates the converter efficiency, this design guarantees minimum control action to correct the lamp power deviation caused by the lamp aging. A 600W prototype has been built to validate the design proposal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 March 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-23 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1620666/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8946740","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Phase-controlled quadruple LC/sub p/ resonant inverter to drive 600W HPS lamps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-controlled quadruple LC/sub p/ resonant inverter to drive 600W HPS lamps","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01620666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04231S","chronDate":"19-23 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10769","isNumber":"33947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10769","xplore-issue":"33947","articleId":"1620666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1620670,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqiao Shen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Guoqiao Shen","id":"37395137000"},{"name":"Dehong Xu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Dehong Xu","id":"37278438200"},{"name":"Danji Xi","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Danji Xi","id":"37426048200"},{"name":"Xiaoming Yuan","affiliation":["General Electric Corporate Research and Development, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoming Yuan","id":"37278113000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9547-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1048-2334"}],"articleNumber":"1620670","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":682},"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel control strategy for grid-connected voltage source inverters (VSI) with an LCL-filter. The strategy \"split\" the capacitor of LCL-filter into two parts, and the current flowing between these two parts is measured and used as the feedback of a current regulator to stabilize and improve the system performances. By this way, the inverter control system is simplified from third-order to first-order, and the close loop control system can easily be optimized for minimum steady-state error and current harmonic distortion. The characteristics of the inverter system with the proposed controller are investigated and compared with the traditional strategy. Simulations results are provided, and the new current control strategy has been experimentally tested on a 5kW fuel cell inverter.","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

Some illustrative, experimental results are also presented in the paper. The control algorithms of the proposed APF are implemented in the fixed-point digital signal processor TMS320F2812 from Texas Instruments using eZDSP system kit. The presented control APF algorithm is a good alternative to classical APF control algorithms, because it allows easy selection of control parameters in mains currents: imbalance, reactive power or harmonics contents.

A typical application of the proposed converter is a fuel cell system with a supercapacitor/battery as the storage. The boost-half-bridge that connects to the supercapacitor plays a key role in accommodating the wide operating voltage of the supercapacitor. With this technique, the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) operating range is extended to the entire phase shift region. Furthermore, both the current stress and the conduction losses of the power switches are reduced compared to other methods. In addition, a control scheme employing multiple PI regulators for this converter is presented. A prototype has been built. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed converter and the control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2006.1620700","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

The design of the power supply of these amplifiers is challenging since many requirements have to be accomplished: very low output voltage ripple; wide output voltage variation at kHz frequencies; fast load current steps; etc. A typical solution is the use of a multiphase dc-dc converter based on the buck topology. In this paper, we propose the use of digital control for these power supplies. The main advantage is that current loops are removed. The design of this control circuit and main trade-offs are discussed.

Effective NN-based applications in power electronics require hardware implementations that exploit the inherent parallelism of NNs. Nonetheless, most NN hardware implementations have been realized using digital signal processors (DSP) or computers that offer serial processing. Nowadays, parallel programmable logic devices, such as the field programmable gate array (FPGA) with embedded microprocessors, have become powerful hardware options, offering low cost, high execution speed, reconfigurability and parallelism. This work intends to exploit the current available resources in commercial FPGAs to implement NN-based controllers for power electronics applications.

Anyway, both PR and HC necessitate the resonant frequency value inside their internal model. Normally, the nominal value of the grid frequency and its multiples are used, but in the case when the grid frequency experiences fluctuations, the performance of both PR and HC is diminished. This paper discuss the possibility of improving the behavior of resonant controller and harmonic compensator in the case of grid frequency variations. The proposed solution makes use of the frequency information provided by the phase-locked loop (PLL) system already used in most of DPGS today.

While for the DM filter part design rules and procedures are well-known and the parameters are easier to derive, the CM filter design is often based on trial-and-error methods and/or on the experience of the designer. In this work, a comprehensive design procedure for a CM EMC input filter is performed exemplarily for a three-phase three-switch buck-type PWM rectifier with an integrated boost output stage. A simplified model of the CM noise propagation is developed and the relevant parasitic impedances are identified. A capacitive connection from the star-point of the DM input filter to the capacitive centre point of the rectifier output voltage is proposed and the effect of this measure concerning CM EMC is verified. Finally, a two stage CM filter is designed and the compliance to the conducted emission requirements of CISPR 22 class A is verified through measurements on a 5 kW prototype","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2006.1620757","publicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

Phase self-inductance, phase voltage switching angles, DC bus voltage level and shaft speed of the generator have been identified as design parameters and control variables affecting output power. Depending on the application each one can be defined as either design parameter or control variable. Due to highly nonlinear characteristics of switched reluctance generator, there is no analytical equation for output power in terms of design parameters and control variables. So, iterative simulation of the generator model on the range of design parameters and control variables has been used for finding output power profile. Since it is a multidimensional search space, the number of iterations is very big. Therefore, we have used theoretical knowledge about the generator and practical limitations to narrow the search space and reduce simulation time. Output power profile of a 1hp generator has been presented from simulation results. These results have been verified by experimental measurements on a test-bed in the lab. The results give the performance of switched reluctance generator for the range of machine parameters and control variables. They show the existence of optimal output power and give guidance for design of the generator and its controller.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2006.1620761","startPage":"6 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-First Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

The vast majority of computer architects believe the future of the microprocessor is hundreds to thousands of processors (\"cores\") on a chip. Given such widespread agreement, it's surprising how much research remains to be done in algorithms, computer architecture, networks, operating systems, file systems, compilers, programming languages, applications, and so on to realize this vision. Fortunately, Moore's law has not only enabled dense multi-core chips, it has also enabled extremely dense FPGAs. Today, one to two dozen soft cores can be programmed into a single FPGA. With multiple FPGAs on a board and multiple boards in a system, 1000-processor designs can be economically and rapidly explored. To make this happen, however, requires a significant amount of infrastructure in hardware, software, and what we call \"gateware\", the register-transfer level models that fill the FGPAs. By using the Berkeley Emulation Engine boards that were created for other purposes, the hardware is already done. A group of architects plan to design the gateware, create this infrastructure, and share the results in an open-source fashion so that every institution could have their own. Such a system would not just invigorate multiprocessors research in the architecture community. Since processors cores can run at 100 to 200 MHz, a large scale multiprocessor would be fast enough to run operating systems and large programs at speeds sufficient to support software research. Moreover, there is a new generation of FPGAs every 18 months with capacity for twice as many cores and run them faster, so future multiboard FPGA systems are even more attractive. Hence, we believe such a system would accelerate research across all the fields that touch multiple processors. Thus the acronynm RAMP, for Research Accelerator for Multiple Processors. RAMP has the potential to transform the parallel computing community in computer science from a simulation-driven to a prototype-driven discipline, leading to rapid iteration across interfaces of the many fields of multiple processors, and thereby moving much more quickly to a parallel foundation for large-scale computer systems research in the 21st century.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2006.1620784","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/10781/33948/01620784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2006.1620784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33948","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAMP: research accelerator for multiple processors - a community vision for a shared experimental parallel HW/SW platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1620784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RAMP: research accelerator for multiple processors - a community vision for a shared experimental parallel HW/SW platform","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620784/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8894886","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1620784/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAMP: research accelerator for multiple processors - a community vision for a shared experimental parallel HW/SW platform","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01620784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035305S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10781","isNumber":"33948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10781","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33948","articleId":"1620784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1620785,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

This approach, called functional warming, is the main performance bottleneck of simulation sampling and requires hours of runtime while the detailed simulation of the sample requires only minutes. Existing simulators can avoid functional simulation by jumping directly to particular instruction stream locations with architectural state checkpoints. To replace functional warming, these checkpoints must additionally provide microarchitectural model state that is accurate and reusable across experiments while meeting tight storage constraints. In this paper, we present a simulation-sampling framework that replaces functional warming with live-points without sacrificing accuracy. A live-point stores the bare minimum of functionally-warmed state for accurate simulation of a limited execution window while placing minimal restrictions on microarchitectural configuration. Live-points can be processed in random rather than program order, allowing simulation results and their statistical confidence to be reported while simulations are in progress. Our framework matches the accuracy of prior simulation-sampling techniques (i.e., /spl plusmn/3% error with 99.7% confidence), while estimating the performance of an 8-way out-of-order superscalar processor running SPEC CPU2000 in 91 seconds per benchmark, on average, using a 12 GB live-point library.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2006.1620785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2006.1620785","startPage":"2","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/10781/33948/01620785.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation sampling with live-points","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Simulation sampling with live-points","conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1620785/","accessionNumber":"8894887","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620785/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation sampling with live-points","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01620785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074341S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10781","isNumber":"33948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10781","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"33948","articleId":"1620785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1620794,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Partitioned (or clustered) architectures have been proposed in recent years to address scalability concerns in future billion-transistor microprocessors. Our analysis shows that increasing processor resources in a clustered architecture results in a linear increase in power consumption, while providing diminishing improvements in single-thread performance. To preserve high performance to power ratios, we claim that the power consumption of additional resources should be in proportion to the performance improvements they yield. Hence, in this paper, we propose the implementation of heterogeneous clusters that have varying delay and power characteristics. A cluster's performance and power characteristic is tuned by scaling its frequency and novel policies dynamically assign frequencies to clusters, while attempting to either meet a fixed power budget or minimize a metric such as Energy /spl times/ Delay/sup 2/ (ED/sup 2/). By increasing resources in a power-efficient manner, we observe an 11% improvement in ED/sup 2/ and a 22.4% average reduction in peak temperature, when compared to a processor with homogeneous units. Our proposed processor model also provides strategies to handle thermal emergencies that have a relatively low impact on performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2006.1620794","startPage":"100","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/10781/33948/01620794.pdf","endPage":"111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2006.1620794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620794/","displayDocTitle":"Power efficient resource scaling in partitioned architectures through dynamic heterogeneity","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1620794/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8894896","publicationDate":"2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power efficient resource scaling in partitioned architectures through dynamic heterogeneity","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01620794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081194S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10781","isNumber":"33948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10781","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33948","articleId":"1620794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1620796,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Many advanced algorithms exist to speed these search primitives on network processors, general purpose machines, and even custom ASICs. However, supporting these applications with standard memories requires very careful analysis of access patterns, and achieving worst case performance can be quite difficult and complex. A simple solution is often possible if a Ternary CAM (content addressable memory) is used to perform a fully parallel search across the entire data set. Unfortunately, this parallelism means that large portions of the chip are switching during each cycle, causing large amounts of power to be consumed. While researchers have begun to explore new ways of managing the power consumption, quantifying design alternatives is difficult due to a lack of available models. In this paper, we examine the structure inside a modern TCAM and present a simple, yet accurate, power model. We present techniques to estimate the dynamic power consumption of a large TCAM. We validate the model using industrial TCAM datasheets and prior published works. We present an extensive analysis of the model by varying various architectural parameters. We also describe how new network algorithms have the potential to address the growing problem of power management in next-generation network devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1620796/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1620796/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8894898","conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2006","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling TCAM power for next generation network devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling TCAM power for next generation network devices","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01620796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067733S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10781","isNumber":"33948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10781","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"33948","articleId":"1620796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1620808,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The robustness of the method is studied as well as the influence of the delay between the acquisitions of the two images.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2005.861699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/33954/01621084.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2005.861699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33954","startPage":"227","endPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial resolution improvement by merging MERIS-ETM images for coastal water monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial resolution improvement by merging MERIS-ETM images for coastal water monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8878759","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1621084/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial resolution improvement by merging MERIS-ETM images for coastal water monitoring","sourcePdf":"01621084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04476S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"33954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"33954","articleId":"1621084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1621093,"authors":[{"name":"Lingli Wang","affiliation":["George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Lingli Wang","id":"37559745600"},{"name":"J.J.

It was successfully launched onboard the Terra satellite in December 1999 and Aqua satellite in May 2002. Both MODIS instruments have been working well except that 15 of the 20 detectors in Aqua MODIS band 6 (1.628-1.652 \u03bcm) are either nonfunctional or noisy. The striping in Aqua MODIS band 6 caused by its nonfunctional or noisy detectors has been a serious problem for MODIS snow products, which use band 6 primarily for snow detection. MODIS scientists have been using Aqua MODIS band 7 (2.105-2.155 \u03bcm) instead of band 6 for computing the normalized difference snow index to continue detecting global snow coverage. The main objective of this letter is to retrieve Aqua MODIS band 6 using other bands based on their relationships in Terra MODIS. The band retrieval approach proposed in this letter is also very useful for the next generation of MODIS sensor-the Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) band M10 proxy data generation. Such proxy data can support the VIIRS prelaunch end-to-end testing, postlaunch calibration/validation, and data quality checking.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2006.869966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/33954/01621093.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2006.869966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for retrieving band 6 of aqua MODIS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621093/","displayDocTitle":"A new method for retrieving band 6 of aqua MODIS","volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8878768","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621093/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for retrieving band 6 of aqua MODIS","sourcePdf":"01621093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077658S","chronDate":"April  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"33954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"33954","articleId":"1621093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":1621095,"authors":[{"name":"G.

On the other hand, if the client has a \"file transferor\" utility function (a utility function that is a step function), the client would be unwilling to pay until the final time slot of the file transfer. We also study an expanded game where an access point sells to a reseller,which in turn sells to a mobile client and show that if the client has a web browser utility function, that constant price is a Nash equilibrium of the three player game. Finally, we study a two player game in which the access point does not know whether he faces a web browser or file transferor type client, and show conditions for which it is not a Nash equilibrium for the access point to maintain a constant price.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33955/01621108.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2006.872553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2006.872553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33955","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WiFi access point pricing as a dynamic game","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Nash equilibrium","Internet","Cryptography","Telecommunication traffic","Communication system security","Cellular networks","Management information systems","Technology management","Subscriptions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless LAN","radio access networks","game theory","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiFi access point pricing","dynamic game","wireless access point","Nash equilibrium","Web browser utility function","file transferor type client"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game theory","network pricing","WiFi pricing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"WiFi access point pricing as a dynamic game","volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1621108/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8976387","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiFi access point pricing as a dynamic game","sourcePdf":"01621108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080998S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"33955","articleId":"1621108","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621109,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Lin","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Systems and Applications (CWSA), School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/33955/1621109/1621109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojun Lin (S'02\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree from Zhongshan University, Guangzhou, China, in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University.

In previous work, we have developed an optimal cross-layer congestion control scheme that jointly computes both the rate allocation and the stabilizing schedule that controls the resources at the underlying layers. However, the scheduling component in this optimal cross-layer congestion control scheme has to solve a complex global optimization problem at each time, and is hence too computationally expensive for online implementation. In this paper, we study how the performance of cross-layer congestion control will be impacted if the network can only use an imperfect (and potentially distributed) scheduling component that is easier to implement. We study both the case when the number of users in the system is fixed and the case with dynamic arrivals and departures of the users, and we establish performance bounds of cross-layer congestion control with imperfect scheduling. Compared with a layered approach that does not design congestion control and scheduling together, our cross-layer approach has provably better performance bounds,and substantially outperforms the layered approach. The insights drawn from our analyzes also enable us to design a fully distributed cross-layer congestion control and scheduling algorithm for a restrictive interference model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1621109/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8976388","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The impact of imperfect scheduling on cross-Layer congestion control in wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of imperfect scheduling on cross-Layer congestion control in wireless networks","sourcePdf":"01621109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098471S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"33955","articleId":"1621109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":1621110,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

Due to the spatial correlation between sensor nodes subject to observed events, it may not be necessary for every sensor node to transmit its data. This paper shows how the spatial correlation can be exploited on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort which exploits spatial correlation in WSN on the MAC layer. A theoretical framework is developed for transmission regulation of sensor nodes under a distortion constraint. It is shown that a sensor node can act as a representative node for several other sensor nodes observing the correlated data. Based on the theoretical framework, a distributed, spatial Correlation-based Collaborative Medium Access Control (CC-MAC) protocol is then designed which has two components: Event MAC (E-MAC) and Network MAC (N-MAC). E-MAC filters out the correlation in sensor records while N-MAC prioritizes the transmission of route-thru packets. Simulation results show that CC-MAC achieves high performance in terms energy, packet drop rate, and latency.","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33955/01621110.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"329","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2006.872544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2006.872544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial correlation-based collaborative medium access control in wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Spatial correlation-based collaborative medium access control in wireless sensor networks","htmlLink":"/document/1621110/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8976389","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial correlation-based collaborative medium access control in wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01621110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104489S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"297","xplore-issue":"33955","articleId":"1621110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":1621116,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The algorithm performs parallel queries on Bloom filters, an efficient data structure for membership queries, in order to determine address prefix membership in sets of prefixes sorted by prefix length. We show that use of this algorithm for Internet Protocol (IP) routing lookups results in a search engine providing better performance and scalability than TCAM-based approaches. The key feature of our technique is that the performance, as determined by the number of dependent memory accesses per lookup, can be held constant for longer address lengths or additional unique address prefix lengths in the forwarding table given that memory resources scale linearly with the number of prefixes in the forwarding table. Our approach is equally attractive for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit destination addresses, four times longer than IPv4. We present a basic version of our approach along with optimizations leveraging previous advances in LPM algorithms. We also report results of performance simulations of our system using snapshots of IPv4 BGP tables and extend the results to IPv6. Using less than 2 Mb of embedded RAM and a commodity SRAM device, our technique achieves average performance of one hash probe per lookup and a worst case of two hash probes and one array access per lookup.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621116/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8976395","volume":"14","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Longest prefix matching using bloom filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Longest prefix matching using bloom filters","sourcePdf":"01621116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069081S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"33955","articleId":"1621116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621129,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/33956/1621129/1621129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Ji (S'02) received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1994 and the M.S. degree from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute, IN. in 2001, both in electrical and computer engineering.

Using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations we examine the time-dependent electric field waveforms and energy dose spatial distributions within a finite volume of biological cell culture medium during these experiments. The simulations show that when one or more flasks containing cell culture media are placed inside the GTEM cell, the uniform fields of the empty GTEM cell are significantly perturbed. The fields inside the cell culture medium, representing the fields to which the biological cells are exposed, are no longer monopolar and are spatially highly nonuniform. These effects result from a combination of refraction and distortion of the incident wave, combined with excitation of resonant eigenmodes within the cell culture medium volume. The simulations show that these distortions of the incident waveform may be mitigated by supporting the sample on a high permittivity pedestal and modifying the incident waveform to more closely approximate a Gaussian pulse. Under all simulated conditions,the estimated maximum temperature rises are completely negligible, ensuring that any experimentally observed unusual cell function or histopathology can be associated with nonthermal effects","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2005.863959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/33956/01621129.pdf","startPage":"780","endPage":"789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.863959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD analysis of a gigahertz TEM cell for ultra-wideband pulse exposure studies of biological specimens","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621129/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD analysis of a gigahertz TEM cell for ultra-wideband pulse exposure studies of biological specimens","volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8962024","pubMedId":"16686400","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621129/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD analysis of a gigahertz TEM cell for ultra-wideband pulse exposure studies of biological specimens","sourcePdf":"01621129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085218S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"33956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"33956","articleId":"1621129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621130,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These recordings require intensive surgical operations to implant the electrodes within the brain which are hazardous to the patient. Here, we have developed a novel approach to quantify the dynamical changes of the brain using the scalp EEG. The scalp signals are preprocessed by means of an effective block-based blind source separation (BSS) technique to separate the underlying sources within the brain. The algorithm significantly removes the effect of eye blinking artifacts. An overlap window procedure has been incorporated in order to mitigate the inherent permutation problem of BSS and maintain the continuity of the estimated sources. Chaotic behavior of the underlying sources has then been evaluated by measuring the largest Lyapunov exponent.

We express the MMSE as a function of the filter's rank and use it as a criterion to evaluate the performance of the beamformers. We do not make any assumptions on the rank of the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix. Instead, we treat it as low-rank and derive a general expression for the MMSE.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the commonly used Doppler ultrasound technique for monitoring of mechanical activity of fetal heart. Accuracy of beat-to-beat interval determination together with its influence on indices describing the fetal heart rate (FHR) variability calculated automatically using computer-aided fetal monitoring system were examined. We considered the direct fetal electrocardiography as a reference technique because it ensures the highest possible accuracy of heart interval measurement, and additionally all the definitions of popular time domain parameters quantifying FHR variability formerly have been created using the fetal electrocardiogram. We evaluated the reliability of various so called short-term and long-term variability indices, when they are calculated automatically using the signal obtained via the Doppler US from a fetal monitor. The results proved that evaluation of the acquisition technique influence on fetal well-being assessment cannot be accomplished basing on direct measurements of heartbeats only. The more relevant is the estimation of accuracy of the variability indices, since analysis of their changes can significantly increase predictability of fetal distress","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2005.863945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.863945","startPage":"855","endPage":"864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/33956/01621137.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Doppler ultrasound and direct electrocardiography acquisition techniques for quantification of fetal heart rate variability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Doppler ultrasound and direct electrocardiography acquisition techniques for quantification of fetal heart rate variability","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","volume":"53","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621137/","accessionNumber":"8962032","pubMedId":"16686408","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621137/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Doppler ultrasound and direct electrocardiography acquisition techniques for quantification of fetal heart rate variability","sourcePdf":"01621137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172934S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"33956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"33956","articleId":"1621137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1621147,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Gyu Lim","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"Yong Gyu Lim","id":"37292110500"},{"name":"Ko Keun Kim","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"Ko Keun Kim","id":"37280247000"},{"name":"Suk Park","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Seoul National University, Chongno-Gu, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"Suk Park","id":"37281166000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"1621147","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":153,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2216},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Conductivity measurement","Electrodes","Biomedical measurements","Skin","Monitoring","Operational amplifiers","Capacitance","Circuit noise","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical electrodes","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG","long-term everyday electrocardiogram monitoring","electrodes","high-input-impedance amplifiers","large ground-plane","motion artifacts","Ag-AgCl"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active electrode","ECG monitoring","high-input impedance","indirect-contact electrode"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Amplifiers, Electronic","Electric Conductivity","Electrocardiography, Ambulatory","Electrodes","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Feasibility Studies","Posture"]}],"abstract":"For the purpose of long-term, everyday electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, we present a convenient method of ECG measurement without direct conductive contact with the skin while subjects sat on a chair wearing normal clothes.

This approach does not rely on availability of a forward solution and thus is applicable to problems in which a forward solution is not readily available, such as fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG). The LMMSE criterion leads to a spatial filter that is a function of the autocorrelation matrix of the data and the autocorrelation matrix of the signal. The signal statistics are unknown, so we approximate the signal autocorrelation matrix using the average of the data across epochs. This approximation is reasonable provided the mean of the noise is zero across epochs and the signal mean is significant. An analysis of the error incurred using this approximation is presented. Calculations of SNR for the exact and approximate LMMSE filters and simple averaging for the rank-1 signal case are shown.

During global iterations, updated estimates of the source correlation are obtained and passed on to the sum-product decoder that performs local iterations with a predefined stopping criterion and/or a maximum number of local decoding iterations. Simulation results indicate that very few global iterations (2-5) are sufficient to reap significant benefits from implicit knowledge of source correlation. Finally, we provide analytical performance bounds for our iterative joint decoder and comparisons with sample simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel coding","Iterative decoding","Source coding","Parity check codes","Image coding","Bit error rate","Turbo codes","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes","combined source-channel coding","iterative decoding","product codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC","channel coding","correlated sources","iterative joint decoding","low-density parity-check","sum-product decoder","global iterations","source correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlated sources","iterative decoding","joint decoding","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","Slepian\u2013Wolf","soft decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621157","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873062","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33957/01621157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873062","startPage":"577","endPage":"582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC-based channel coding of correlated sources with iterative joint decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LDPC-based channel coding of correlated sources with iterative joint decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621157/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1621157/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8973584","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC-based channel coding of correlated sources with iterative joint decoding","sourcePdf":"01621157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056401S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"33957","articleId":"1621157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621158,"authors":[{"name":"M.

At increased complexity, a soft version of sphere decoding (SD), so-termed list SD (LSD), has been recently applied to coded layered space-time (LST) systems enabling them to approach the capacity of MIMO channels. By introducing a novel bit-level multi-stream coded LST transmitter along with a soft-to-hard conversion at the decoder, we show how to achieve the near-capacity performance of LSD, and even outperform it as the size of the block to be decoded (M) increases. Specifically, for binary real LST codes, we develop exact max-log-based SD schemes with M + 1 HSD steps, and an approximate alternative with only one HSD step to trade off performance for average complexity. These schemes apply directly to the real and imaginary parts of quaternary phase-shift keying signaling, and also to quadrature amplitude modulation signaling after incorporating an appropriate interference estimation and cancellation module. We corroborate our near-optimal soft detection (SoD) algorithms based on HSD (SoD-HSD) with simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33957/01621159.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaching MIMO channel capacity with soft detection based on hard sphere decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Approaching MIMO channel capacity with soft detection based on hard sphere decoding","volume":"54","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"8973586","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1621159/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaching MIMO channel capacity with soft detection based on hard sphere decoding","sourcePdf":"01621159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073725S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"33957","articleId":"1621159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621160,"authors":[{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Dong In Kim","id":"37279315300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"1621160","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","Multidimensional systems","Multiaccess communication","Maximum likelihood decoding","Wideband","Redundancy","Reliability engineering","Signal analysis","Data communication","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","code division multiple access","broadband networks","error statistics","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-likelihood symbol-by-symbol detection","multidimensional multicode WCDMA","precoding","high-rate uplink transmission","parallel multicode channels","wideband code division multiple-access signaling","symbol-error probability","multidimensional signaling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicode (MC) wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA)","multidimensional (MD) signaling","precoding","selective maximum-likelihood (SML) detection"]}],"abstract":"To faciliate high-rate uplink transmission, a novel selective maximum-likelihood (SML) detection is realized on a set of parallel multicode (MC) channels as a result of MC wideband code-division multiple-access (WCDMA) signaling with precoding.

They also used one D-lag decision-feedback maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector to detect the information bits. A straightforward extension (noniterative) to multiuser synchronous CDMA cases, i.e., adding the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multiuser detector into their scheme, results in poor performance. Therefore, we propose an iterative scheme which combines vector channel estimation, decision-feedback MAP detection, and PIC. The partial PIC is applied in the sequence hypothesis stage of MAP in each iteration before the final MAP decision. The proposed scheme has twice the decision delay of the previous scheme for single-user cases. The performance of the proposed system in the time-selective, correlated multipath fading channel environment is investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the noniterative scheme. Simulation results also show that the proposed scheme performs better than its scalar channel-estimation version.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33957/01621164.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative vector channel estimation/MAP/PIC for CDMA systems in time-selective correlated multipath fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621164/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative vector channel estimation/MAP/PIC for CDMA systems in time-selective correlated multipath fading channels","volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8973591","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621164/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative vector channel estimation/MAP/PIC for CDMA systems in time-selective correlated multipath fading channels","sourcePdf":"01621164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060414S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33957","articleId":"1621164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1621167,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Joon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Mobile Telecommunication Research Division, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/33957/1621167/1621167-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung Joon Lee (S'94\u2013A'98\u2013M'02) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 1991, 1993, and 1998, respectively.

Specifically, we consider two degrees of transmitter channel knowledge: 1) perfect feedback is available and power control is employed and 2) no channel state knowledge is available at the transmitters and only spatial power allocation is possible. First, when perfect feedback is available, the optimal power control policy determines the ultimate limits of performance for constant rate transmission in the slow fading environment. However, in practice, perfect channel knowledge is not possible at the transmitters due to the finite capacity of the feedback links. We find practical methods to approach this performance limit through the use of power control with finite rate feedback. The finite-rate feedback results are shown for the low-complexity, full-diversity amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. Interestingly, we see that only a few feedback bits are needed to achieve most of the gains of the optimal perfect feedback power control algorithm. Second, we consider the performance limit when the transmitters have no channel state knowledge and derive the optimal spatial power allocation between the source and relay for a given sum power constraint for the AF protocol. For most practical cases of interest, equal power allocation between the source and relay is shown to be nearly optimal. Our work suggests that there is minimal power savings from using spatial power allocation at the transmitters. To obtain large performance improvements over constant power transmission, it is imperative to have feedback for each realization of the channel state to allow for temporal power control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621169/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8973596","volume":"54","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Outage minimization with limited feedback for the fading relay channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage minimization with limited feedback for the fading relay channel","sourcePdf":"01621169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075956S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"33957","articleId":"1621169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1621170,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Cui (S'04) received the B.

Avoiding a computationally prohibitive exhaustive search, we solve our data detectors using sphere decoding (SD) and V-BLAST and provide simple adaptations of the SD algorithm. We consider how the blind detector performs under mismatch, generalize the basic data detectors to nonunitary constellations, and extend them to systems with pilots and virtual carriers.

Considering the effect of shadowing and distance-dependent path loss, we approximate the probability density of interference at each base station (BS) and compare numerical and simulation results for different path-loss parameters. We derive the probability density of the received power at each BS due to transmission of one packet from a random node, as well as the probability distribution of the number of packets received at each node per time slot. Subsequently, we use the above results to approximate the probability density of the total received power at each BS based on calculations of moments. We observe that the probability density of intercell interference due to transmissions from terminals and routers may be approximated by normal and log-normal densities, respectively. We quantify the network performance based on throughput, total consumed power, and outage probability for different system parameters. For homogeneous link efficiencies, introducing routers into the network while reducing the transmission power increases the mean and variance of interference to the desired signal, hence higher outage probability. However, there are ample opportunities inherent to multihop structure, applicable to any of the physical, data link, and network layers, which help increase the overall achievable network throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873076","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33957/01621171.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33957","startPage":"680","endPage":"692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and modeling of upstream throughput in multihop packet CDMA cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and modeling of upstream throughput in multihop packet CDMA cellular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8973598","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1621171/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and modeling of upstream throughput in multihop packet CDMA cellular networks","sourcePdf":"01621171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076192S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33957","articleId":"1621171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621174,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

By exploiting varying channel conditions, adaptive modulation can be used in ad hoc networks to provide upper layers with higher capacity links over which to relay traffic. Using the /spl alpha/-stable interference model, the distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is obtained for a slotted system of randomly, uniformly distributed nodes using multilevel coherent modulation schemes. Performance is evaluated in terms of the information efficiency, which is a new progress-related measure for multihop networks. Three types of adaptivity are analyzed, differing in the level of CSI available: 1) full knowledge of the SIR at the receiver; 2) knowledge of only the signal attenuation due to fading; and 3) knowledge of only the slow fading component of the signal attenuation. The effect of imperfect channel information is also investigated. Sample results are given for interference-limited networks experiencing fourth-power path loss with distance, Ricean fading, and lognormal shadowing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621174/","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1621174/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8973601","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive modulation in ad hoc DS/CDMA packet radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive modulation in ad hoc DS/CDMA packet radio networks","sourcePdf":"01621174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095397S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"33957","articleId":"1621174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1621175,"authors":[{"name":"M.-O.

It is first shown that the minimum sum-power beamformers for the network satisfy a weak duality condition, in which the pairs ((g/sub i//sup opt/)*, (W/sub i//sup opt/)*) achieve the same sum power as the primal network. However, the optimum receive beamformer w/sub i//sup opt/ is not in general equal to (g/sub i//sup opt/)*, in contrast to the case of cellular and time-division duplexing networks. Iterative minimum mean-square error (IMMSE) beamforming algorithms are then proposed in which w/sub i/ = g/sub i/* is enforced. These algorithms are shown to be instances of the Power Algorithm in which gi is the maximizing eigenvector of an SNR-related objective matrix. The IMMSE algorithm can also be viewed as a noncooperative beamforming game, in which the payoff includes normalized SNR, and the tax is related to interference caused at other nodes. The existence of fixed points (Nash equilibria) is proved for IMMSE. Furthermore, fixed points of IMMSE are shown to satisfy the first-order necessary conditions for optimization using a network Lagrangian. The IMMSE game is modified to yield a sequential distortionless-response beamforming algorithm, which is shown to be convergent using a Total Interference Function. Extensive simulation results illustrate that IMMSE yields better power efficiency than a greedy noncooperative SNR-maximizing game.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33957/01621177.pdf","startPage":"748","endPage":"759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33957","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncooperative iterative MMSE beamforming algorithms for ad hoc networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Iterative algorithms","Ad hoc networks","Signal processing algorithms","Lagrangian functions","Quality of service","Interference","Wireless networks","MIMO","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","iterative methods","ad hoc networks","quality of service","cellular radio","time division multiplexing","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncooperative iterative MMSE","beamforming algorithms","asynchronous unicast ad hoc network","quality-of-service","QoS","cellular networks","time-division duplexing networks","minimum mean-square error","Nash equilibria"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","game theory","least-mean-square (LMS) methods","networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Noncooperative iterative MMSE beamforming algorithms for ad hoc networks","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1621177/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8973604","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncooperative iterative MMSE beamforming algorithms for ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"01621177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100407S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"33957","articleId":"1621177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621178,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Using frame-error rate (FER) as a metric, we define the user cooperation gain (G) for evaluating the relative performance improvement of cooperative over direct transmissions when a particular channel code is used. We introduce the cooperation decision parameter (CDP), which is a function of user-to-destination average received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and demonstrate that whether cooperation is useful or not (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$G\u226b1$</tex>\nor\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$G\u226a1$</tex>\n) depends only on the CDP, not the interuser link quality.

We then provide conditions on user and destination locations for cooperation to be beneficial for arbitrary SNRs.

In a speech communication system, the speech signal is typically buffered for a period of 10-40 ms and, therefore, the use of either a causal or a noncausal filter is possible. We show that the causal Kalman algorithm is in conflict with the basic properties of human perception and address the problem of improving its perceptual quality. We discuss two approaches to improve perceptual performance. The first is based on a new method that combines the causal Kalman algorithm with pre- and postfiltering to introduce perceptual shaping of the residual noise. The second is based on the conventional Kalman smoother. We show that a short lag removes the conflict resulting from the causality constraint and we quantify the minimum lag required for this purpose. The results of our objective and subjective evaluations confirm that both approaches significantly outperform the conventional causal implementation. Of the two approaches, the Kalman smoother performs better if the signal statistics are precisely known, if this is not the case the perceptually weighted Kalman filter performs better.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33958/01621192.pdf","startPage":"764","endPage":"773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.857802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.857802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33958","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On causal algorithms for speech enhancement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Wiener filter","Kalman filters","Nonlinear filters","Humans","Filtering","Background noise","Oral communication","Acoustic noise","Noise shaping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech enhancement","Kalman filters","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech enhancement","causal Kalman filtering","noncausal filter","human perception","postfiltering","prefiltering","perceptual shaping","residual noise","causal algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autoregressive (AR) model","causal filter","Kalman filter","Kalman smoother","optimal lag","speech enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"On causal algorithms for speech enhancement","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1621192/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8983490","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On causal algorithms for speech enhancement","sourcePdf":"01621192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111475S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"33958","articleId":"1621192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1621194,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.H.

Detailed comparative performance analysis for the features obtained using the three optimization criteria, LDA, PCA, and MCE, with various types of noise and a wide range of SNR values is presented. It was found that the new criteria lead to superior performance over the original MFCC features, just as LDA-derived filters can. In addition, the newly proposed MCE-derived filters can often do better than the LDA-derived filters. Also, it is shown that further performance improvements are achievable if any of these LDA/PCA/MCE-derived filters are integrated with the conventional approach of cepstral mean and variance normalization (CMVN). The performance improvements obtained in recognition experiments are further supported by analyses conducted using two different distance measures.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33958/01621196.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of temporal filters for constructing robust features in speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.857801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.857801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621196/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of temporal filters for constructing robust features in speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8983494","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1621196/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of temporal filters for constructing robust features in speech recognition","sourcePdf":"01621196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08596S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"33958","articleId":"1621196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621198,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This paper focuses on a new framework for speech recognition using maximum entropy direct modeling, where the probability of a state or word sequence given an observation sequence is computed directly from the model. In contrast to HMMs, features can be asynchronous and overlapping. This model therefore allows for the potential combination of many different types of features, which need not be statistically independent of each other. In this paper, a specific kind of direct model, the maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM), is studied. Even with conventional acoustic features, the approach already shows promising results for phone level decoding. The MEMM significantly outperforms traditional HMMs in word error rate when used as stand-alone acoustic models. Preliminary results combining the MEMM scores with HMM and language model scores show modest improvements over the best HMM speech recognizer.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33958/01621200.pdf","startPage":"873","endPage":"881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum entropy direct models for speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.858064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.858064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621200/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Maximum entropy direct models for speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8983498","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1621200/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum entropy direct models for speech recognition","sourcePdf":"01621200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054193S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"33958","articleId":"1621200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1621202,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, in speech recognition applications, the transient aspects of the models have a principal role in the discrimination process and, consequently, capturing this information is crucial in the formulation of any discrimination indicator. This paper proposes the notion of average divergence distance (ADD) as a statistical discrimination measure between two HMMs, considering the transient behavior of these models. This paper provides an analytical formulation of the proposed discrimination measure, a justification of its definition based on the Viterbi decoding approach, and a formal proof that this quantity is well defined for a left-to-right HMM topology with a final nonemitting state, a standard model for basic acoustic units in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Using experiments based on this discrimination measure, it is shown that ADD provides a coherent way to evaluate the discrimination dissimilarity between acoustic models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33958/01621202.pdf","startPage":"890","endPage":"906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.858059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.858059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33958","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average divergence distance as a statistical discrimination measure for hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Density measurement","Acoustic measurements","Automatic speech recognition","Probability density function","Speech recognition","Speech analysis","Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","Viterbi decoding","speech coding","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical discrimination measure","hidden Markov models","HMM","probability density functions","average divergence distance","Viterbi decoding approach","automatic speech recognition","acoustic models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic discrimination measures","hidden Markov models (HMMs)","information theory","Kullback\u2013Leibler distance and divergence","speech recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Average divergence distance as a statistical discrimination measure for hidden Markov models","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1621202/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8983500","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average divergence distance as a statistical discrimination measure for hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"01621202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082469S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"33958","articleId":"1621202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621204,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The task explored is to discriminate speech from nonspeech consisting of animal vocalizations, music, and environmental sounds. Although this is a relatively easy task for humans, it is still difficult to automate well, especially in noisy and reverberant environments. The auditory model captures basic processes occurring from the early cochlear stages to the central cortical areas. The model generates a multidimensional spectro-temporal representation of the sound, which is then analyzed by a multilinear dimensionality reduction technique and classified by a support vector machine (SVM). Generalization of the system to signals in high level of additive noise and reverberation is evaluated and compared to two existing approaches (Scheirer and Slaney, 2002 and Kingsbury et al., 2002). The results demonstrate the advantages of the auditory model over the other two systems, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and high reverberation.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.858055","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33958/01621204.pdf","startPage":"920","endPage":"930","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.858055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrimination of speech from nonspeech based on multiscale spectro-temporal Modulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Discrimination of speech from nonspeech based on multiscale spectro-temporal Modulations","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8983502","publicationDate":"May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1621204/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrimination of speech from nonspeech based on multiscale spectro-temporal Modulations","sourcePdf":"01621204.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069327S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"33958","articleId":"1621204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1621215,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the proposed framework, key audio effects and the background sounds are comprehensively modeled with hidden Markov models, and a Grammar Network is proposed to connect various models to fully explore the transitions among them. Moreover, a set of new spectral features are employed to improve the representation of each audio effect and the discrimination among various effects. The framework is convenient to add or remove target audio effects in various applications. Based on the obtained key effect sequence, a Bayesian network-based approach is proposed to further discover the high-level semantics of an auditory context by integrating prior knowledge and statistical learning. Evaluations on 12 h of audio data indicate that the proposed framework can achieve satisfying results, both on key audio effect detection and auditory context inference.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.857575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33958/01621215.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.857575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible framework for key audio effects detection and auditory context inference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621215/","displayDocTitle":"A flexible framework for key audio effects detection and auditory context inference","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8983513","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621215/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible framework for key audio effects detection and auditory context inference","sourcePdf":"01621215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114844S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"33958","articleId":"1621215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621229,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It enables the extraction and analysis of information such as number, position, speed, movement, and diffusion phases of, e.g., endosomal particles. The method consists of several stages. After a detection stage performed by a three-dimensional (3-D) undecimated wavelet transform, we compute, for each detected spot, several predictions of its future state in the next frame. This is accomplished thanks to an interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm which includes several models corresponding to different biologically realistic movement types. Tracks are constructed, thereafter, by a data association algorithm based on the maximization of the likelihood of each IMM. The last stage consists of updating the IMM filters in order to compute final estimations for the present image and to improve predictions for the next image. The performances of the method are validated on synthetic image data and used to characterize the 3-D movement of endocytic vesicles containing quantum dots.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","volume":"15","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"8937959","pubMedId":"16671288","publicationDate":"May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621229/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple particle tracking in 3-D+t microscopy: method and application to the tracking of endocytosed quantum dots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple particle tracking in 3-D+t microscopy: method and application to the tracking of endocytosed quantum dots","sourcePdf":"01621229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092776S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"33959","articleId":"1621229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":1621234,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Mapping between intensity and color is, therefore, not unique, and colorization is ambiguous in nature and requires some amount of human interaction or external information. A computationally simple, yet effective, approach of colorization is presented in this paper. The method is fast and it can be conveniently used \"on the fly,\" permitting the user to interactively get the desired results promptly after providing a reduced set of chrominance scribbles. Based on the concepts of luminance-weighted chrominance blending and fast intrinsic distance computations, high-quality colorization results for still images and video are obtained at a fraction of the complexity and computational cost of previously reported techniques. Possible extensions of the algorithm introduced here included the capability of changing the colors of an existing color image or video, as well as changing the underlying luminance, and many other special effects demonstrated here.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.864231","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1129","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33959/01621234.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.864231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast image and video colorization using chrominance blending","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gray-scale","Motion pictures","Computational efficiency","Color","Image segmentation","Information geometry","Humans","Interpolation","Art","Photography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colorization","video colorization","grayscale image","luminance-weighted chrominance blending"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chrominance blending","colorization","gradient","interpolation","intrinsic distance","recolorization","special effects"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Color","Colorimetry","Computer Systems","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Time Factors","Video Recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Fast image and video colorization using chrominance blending","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1621234/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8937964","pubMedId":"16671293","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast image and video colorization using chrominance blending","sourcePdf":"01621234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050439S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"309","xplore-issue":"33959","articleId":"1621234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1621236,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In this paper we describe a new algorithm that is especially developed for reducing all kinds of impulse noise: fuzzy impulse noise detection and reduction method (FIDRM). It can also be applied to images having a mixture of impulse noise and other types of noise. The result is an image quasi without (or with very little) impulse noise so that other filters can be used afterwards. This nonlinear filtering technique contains two separated steps: an impulse noise detection step and a reduction step that preserves edge sharpness. Based on the concept of fuzzy gradient values, our detection method constructs a fuzzy set impulse noise. This fuzzy set is represented by a membership function that will be used by the filtering method, which is a fuzzy averaging of neighboring pixels. Experimental results show that FIDRM provides a significant improvement on other existing filters. FIDRM is not only very fast, but also very effective for reducing little as well as very high impulse noise.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.864179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.864179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33959","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33959/01621237.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Pixel","Filters","Gray-scale","Fuzzy sets","Filtering","Active noise reduction","Image processing","Image edge detection","Noise generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","image denoising","nonlinear filters","filtering theory","gradient methods","impulse noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy impulse noise detection","noise reduction method","image processing","nonlinear filtering technique","fuzzy gradient values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy filter","image processing","impulse noise","membership functions","noise reduction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Artificial Intelligence","Fuzzy Logic","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy impulse noise detection and reduction method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621237/","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1621237/","accessionNumber":"8937967","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"16671296","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy impulse noise detection and reduction method","sourcePdf":"01621237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098487S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"33959","articleId":"1621237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1621260,"authors":[{"name":"Gong-Ru Lin","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Gong-Ru Lin","id":"37087144895"},{"name":"I-Hsiang Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"I-Hsiang Chiu","id":"37087476813"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"1621260","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621260","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical pulse generation","Optical fibers","Pulse amplifiers","Pulse compression methods","Stimulated emission","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Fiber lasers","Semiconductor lasers","Optical pulse compression","Laser mode locking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical pulse generation","optical fibre communication","optical communication equipment","optical pulse compression","laser mode locking","semiconductor optical amplifiers","fibre lasers","ring lasers","laser cavity resonators","optical fibre dispersion","chirp modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtosecond pulse generation","single-stage external fiber compression","optically injection-locked laser","mode-locked laser","semiconductor optical amplifier","fiber laser","fiber-based pulse compression","traveling-wave SOA","ring laser","dark-optical-comb","negative chirp","dispersion-compensating fiber","single-stage pulse compression","single-mode-fiber-spool","pulse compression ratio","110 pJ","410 fs","10 GHz","5.4 ps","3.9 ps","75 m","1.7 W","1.1 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-gain modulation (XGM)","femtosecond","fiber laser","injection-mode-locking","pulse compression","semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)"]}],"abstract":"We demonstrate the high-power amplification and single-stage fiber-based pulse compression of a traveling-wave semiconductor optical amplifier (TWSOA) fiber ring laser (SOAFL), which is optically mode-locked by backward injecting the TWSOA with a dark-optical-comb at repetition frequency of 10 GHz.

The maximum average output power of the amplified SOAFL pulse is up to 1.1 W, corresponding to the peak power and pulse energy of >0.27 kW and 110 pJ, respectively.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/33924/01621260.pdf","startPage":"1010","endPage":"1012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2006.873515","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2006.873515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"110-pJ and 410-fs pulse at 10 GHz generated by single-stage external fiber compression of optically injection-mode-locked semiconductor optical amplifier fiber laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"110-pJ and 410-fs pulse at 10 GHz generated by single-stage external fiber compression of optically injection-mode-locked semiconductor optical amplifier fiber laser","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621260/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1621260/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 1, 2006","accessionNumber":"8975180","volume":"18","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1,  2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"110-pJ and 410-fs pulse at 10 GHz generated by single-stage external fiber compression of optically injection-mode-locked semiconductor optical amplifier fiber laser","sourcePdf":"01621260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051231S","chronDate":"May 1,  2006","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"33924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33924","articleId":"1621260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1621261,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper, a new approach to beam-space preprocessing with an improved robustness against such out-of-sector interfering sources is developed. Our techniques design the beam-space matrix filter based on proper tradeoffs between the in-sector (passband) source distortion and out-of-sector (stopband) source attenuation. Computationally efficient convex formulations for these beam-space matrix filter design problems are derived using second-order cone (SOC) programming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621390/","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1621390/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8985056","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Convex optimization based beam-space preprocessing with improved robustness against out-of-sector sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex optimization based beam-space preprocessing with improved robustness against out-of-sector sources","sourcePdf":"01621390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100903S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1621394,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The basic idea is to treat the transmitted symbols and channel gains as unknown states (discrete and continuous) within a hybrid systems framework. The Bayesian-inference-based state estimation is derived using multiple model theory resulting in an optimal joint sequence estimator, which is shown to be intractable in its computational complexity. A suboptimal receiver (IMM-SIC) is then derived based on the well-known Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm and successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme. This paper shows the specific approximations made to the probability densities of the optimal receiver in deriving the IMM-SIC receiver with complexity linear in number of users. This receiver design is well suited for online recursive processing of space-time coded CDMA system, where the decoding stage is incorporated within the multiple model framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33964/01621394.pdf","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.871964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.871964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive joint detection and estimation in MIMO systems: a hybrid systems approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Filtering","Signal processing algorithms","Fading","State estimation","Systems engineering and theory","Computational complexity","Multiuser detection","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","multiuser detection","code division multiple access","state estimation","computational complexity","interference suppression","inference mechanisms","belief networks","fading channels","space-time codes","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","adaptive receiver","hybrid system theory","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output","fading code-division multiple-access system","Bayesian-inference-based state estimation","sequence estimator","computational complexity","interacting multiple model","successive interference cancellation","space-time coded CDMA system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint estimation and detection","multiple models","multiuser detection (MUD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive joint detection and estimation in MIMO systems: a hybrid systems approach","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1621394/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8985060","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive joint detection and estimation in MIMO systems: a hybrid systems approach","sourcePdf":"01621394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117005S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1621395,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

Instead of those based on indirect performance indicators, we in this paper propose a new criterion directly based on the exact bit error rate (BER) that is applicable to systems with linear receivers and rectangular/square quadrature-amplitude-modulation constellations. The BER criterion outperforms any other alternative in terms of optimizing the BER performance for an uncoded system with linear receivers. We then develop a precoder codebook construction method based on the generalized Lloyd algorithm from the vector quantization literature. This construction is not directly based on the BER criterion. Hence, it is suboptimal in the BER sense. However, relative to those currently available, our newfound codebooks improve considerably various minimum distances between any pair of codewords of the codebook. Finally, we analyze the BER-optimal precoder in the asymptotic case with infinite-rate feedback that amounts to perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter. The infinite-rate optimal precoder based on the BER criterion is drastically different from the counterparts with other criteria, and it leads to a benchmark performance for finite-rate precoded spatial multiplexing systems. We observe from numerical results that the BER performance of finite-rate feedback with suboptimal codebooks approaches quickly the benchmark performance of infinite-rate feedback. This suggests that i) the number of feedback bits in practical systems need not be large and ii) the room for performance improvement via further codebook optimization shrinks quickly as the codebook size increases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33964/01621396.pdf","startPage":"1653","endPage":"1665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.872554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.872554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER criterion and codebook construction for finite-rate precoded spatial multiplexing with linear receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Feedback","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Power system modeling","Array signal processing","Vector quantization","Signal processing algorithms","Fading","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","codebook construction","finite-rate precoded spatial multiplexing","linear receivers","bit error rate","quadrature-amplitude-modulation","Lloyd algorithm","vector quantization","infinite-rate feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-rate feedback","Lloyd algorithm","precoding","spatial multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"BER criterion and codebook construction for finite-rate precoded spatial multiplexing with linear receivers","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1621396/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8985062","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER criterion and codebook construction for finite-rate precoded spatial multiplexing with linear receivers","sourcePdf":"01621396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073208S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621401,"authors":[{"name":"Luzhou Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33964/1621401/1621401-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luzhou Xu (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively.

We first extend the recent results (mean and variance) of Tarczynski and Allay by providing both distributional properties as well as rates of almost sure convergence for the simple random sampling scheme of Tarczynski and Allay. The primary focus is to consider and investigate the properties of a class of stratified random sampling estimates. We establish the statistical properties of the estimates, including precise expressions and rate of convergence of the mean-square errors. We also establish the asymptotic normality of the estimates useful for confidence interval calculations. Further, we optimize over the class of the estimates in order to obtain the best performance. In particular, we show that for functions with a first-order continuous derivative, the mean-square estimation error decays precisely at the fast rate of 1/N/sup 3/. This rate is significantly higher than the rate of 1/N for simple random sampling estimates. The analytical results are illustrated by numerical examples. The effect of observation errors on the performance is also investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33964/01621404.pdf","startPage":"1750","endPage":"1761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.872587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.872587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random sampling of deterministic signals: statistical analysis of Fourier transform estimates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Statistical analysis","Fourier transforms","Convergence","Life estimation","Statistics","Estimation error","Nonuniform sampling","Random processes","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","Fourier transforms","mean square error methods","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal random sampling","statistical analysis","Fourier transform","continuous-time deterministic signals","mean-square errors","mean-square estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic normality","Fourier transform","mean-square convergence","nonuniform sampling","rates of almost sure convergence","stratified sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Random sampling of deterministic signals: statistical analysis of Fourier transform estimates","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1621404/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8985070","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random sampling of deterministic signals: statistical analysis of Fourier transform estimates","sourcePdf":"01621404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077551S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1621408,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyang Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Washington University, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33964/1621408/1621408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongyang Deng (S'02\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and M.S. degree in computer science from Sichuan University, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the D.

When the channel state information (CSI) and the noise covariance are known exactly at the receiver, a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) equalizer can be employed to estimate the transmitted signal. However, in actual systems, it is necessary to take into account channel and noise estimation errors. We consider here a worst-case equalizer design problem where the goal is to find the equalizer minimizing the equalization MSE for the least favorable channel model within a neighborhood of the estimated model. The neighborhood is formed by placing a bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the actual and estimated channel models. Lagrangian optimization is used to convert this min-max problem into a convex min-min problem over a convex domain, which is solved by interchanging the minimization order. The robust MSE equalizer and associated least favorable channel model can then be obtained by solving numerically a scalar convex minimization problem. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the MSE and bit error rate (BER) performance of robust equalizers when applied to the least favorable channel model.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.872322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33964/01621412.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.872322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33964","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust MSE equalizer design for MIMO communication systems in the presence of model uncertainties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust MSE equalizer design for MIMO communication systems in the presence of model uncertainties","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621412/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8985078","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1621412/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MSE equalizer design for MIMO communication systems in the presence of model uncertainties","sourcePdf":"01621412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117661S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621413,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33964/1621413/1621413-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pengfei Xia (S'03\u2013M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, in 2005.","His research interest lies in the area of signal processing and communications, including MIMO wireless communications, phased antenna array and beamforming, OFDM and multicarrier transmissions, adaptive modulation and coding."]},"lastName":"Pengfei Xia","id":"37281874800"},{"name":"G.B.

By casting the design of transmit beamforming based on limited-rate feedback as an equivalent sphere vector quantization (SVQ) problem, multiantenna beamformed transmissions through independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels are first considered. The rate-distortion function of the vector source is upper-bounded, and the operational rate-distortion performance achieved by the generalized Lloyd's algorithm is lower-bounded. Although different in nature, the two bounds yield asymptotically equivalent performance analysis results. The average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance is also quantified. Finally, beamformer codebook designs are studied for correlated Rayleigh fading channels, and a low-complexity codebook design that achieves near-optimal performance is derived.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8985079","htmlLink":"/document/1621413/","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of transmit-beamforming based on limited-rate feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of transmit-beamforming based on limited-rate feedback","sourcePdf":"01621413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095995S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1621415,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Such systems can be viewed as serially concatenated, and iterative (turbo) decoding principles can be applied. An analysis of the component systems is presented by studying variance input-output behaviors. Soft symbols are derived from the FEC decoders' extrinsic information outputs. A variance measure of the error of these soft symbols is used in a variance transfer (VT) analysis between component systems to give an accurate description of the convergence properties of the iterative joint decoder. This VT analysis is applied to three CDMA interference resolution component-systems: 1) simple interference cancellation; 2) per-user minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) cancellation; and 3) a low-complexity multistage method that is proposed to approximate the complex MMSE filter. Closed-form equations for large-scale systems are presented for all three filters as the number of users K/spl rarr//spl infin/. It is shown that per-user MMSE filtering has a spectral advantage of 1+1//spl alpha/ over simple matched filtering, where /spl alpha/ is the system load supported by the latter, and the multistage filter can approach the MMSE performance with a few stages. Moreover, the number of filter stages to achieve a certain performance is independent of the number of users. The impact of the FEC systems is studied, and it is shown that for low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) powerful concatenated codes are required, while for higher SNRs, simple single-error control codes support higher system loads. FEC code examples and simulation results are presented and put in contrast with the capacity limits of the random CDMA channel.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Error correction","Iterative decoding","Multiaccess communication","Forward error correction","Matched filters","Concatenated codes","Analysis of variance","Interference cancellation","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","iterative decoding","code division multiple access","error correction codes","forward error correction","random sequences","turbo codes","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","least mean squares methods","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative multiuser detection","error control code decoding","random CDMA","forward-error control","FEC","code-division multiple access","random spreading sequences","turbo decoding","variance transfer analysis","interference resolution component-systems","interference cancellation","per-user minimum-mean-square-error","MMSE filter","signal-to-noise ratios","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiple access (CDMA)","iterative decoding","interference cancellation","variance transfer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621416","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.872585","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33964/01621416.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.872585","startPage":"1886","endPage":"1895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative multiuser detection and error control code decoding in random CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative multiuser detection and error control code decoding in random CDMA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621416/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1621416/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8985082","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative multiuser detection and error control code decoding in random CDMA","sourcePdf":"01621416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072104S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1621417,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques are used to obtain Bayesian estimates (soft information) of the transmitted symbols. Unlike previous reports that widely use statistical inference to estimate a posteriori probability (APP) values, we present alternative statistical methods that are developed by viewing the underlying problem as a multidimensional Monte Carlo integration. We show that this approach leads to results that are similar to those that would be obtained through a proper Rao-Blackwellization technique and thus conclude that our proposed methods are superior to those reported in the literature. We also note that when the channel signal-to-noise ratio is high, MCMC simulator experiences some very slow modes of convergence. Thus accurate estimation of APP values requires simulations of very long Markov chains, which may be infeasible in practice. We propose two solutions to this problem using the theory of importance sampling. Extensive computer simulations show that both solutions improve the system performance greatly.

In this paper, we explore the intrinsic relationship between the size of TB required in the line-based architecture for 2-D DWT (LBA2DDWT) and the number of registers used in a 1-D DWT module, and present a modified view on this issue that has been proposed by Huang et al. An improved method of mapping the registers used in 1-D DWT architecture to the TB required in LBA2DDWT is presented, which reduces more efficiently the size of memory required in LBA2DDWT than Huang's method. A parallel-based lifting scheme (PLS) for DWT and its VLSI architecture are presented. The proposed PLS of DWT not only reduces efficiently the critical path but also results in the equality of the forward discrete wavelet transform and inverse discrete wavelet transform implementations. Compared with Huang's method, the proposed PLS is more efficient in reducing critical path and/or the number of registers of VLSI implementation for 1-D DWT, and it can be concluded that the flipping structure of DWT is a special case of the PLS-based implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8985084","htmlLink":"/document/1621418/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A note on \"Flipping structure: an efficient VLSI architecture for lifting-based discrete wavelet Transform\"","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A note on \"Flipping structure: an efficient VLSI architecture for lifting-based discrete wavelet Transform\"","sourcePdf":"01621418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055828S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1621421,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Jin Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Jin Jeon","id":"37982550200"},{"name":"J.G.

In this correspondence, the blind WL-MOE filter is analyzed, and the convergence properties of an adaptive implementation are derived. The proposed algorithm dramatically outperforms nonwidely linear MOE algorithms when at least one of the signals (desired or interference) is improper, i.e., real-valued. While there is a small performance and complexity penalty relative to the previous WL-MOE algorithm when only real-valued modulation is employed, the great advantage of the proposed algorithm in being able to handle complex valued modulation (such as the popular QAM) in most cases should outweigh this slight penalty.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33964/01621421.pdf","startPage":"1926","endPage":"1931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.870639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.870639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1621421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The blind widely linear minimum output energy algorithm for DS-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Signal processing algorithms","Convergence","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Multiple access interference","Signal processing","Adaptive filters","Multiuser detection","Detectors","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","quadrature amplitude modulation","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind widely linear minimum output energy algorithm","DS-CDMA systems","code-division multiple-access receiver","blind WL-MOE filter","real-valued modulation","convergence properties","complex-valued modulation","QAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convergence analysis","minimum output energy","stochastic gradient method","widely linear algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"The blind widely linear minimum output energy algorithm for DS-CDMA systems","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1621421/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8985087","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The blind widely linear minimum output energy algorithm for DS-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01621421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05755S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33964","articleId":"1621421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1621422,"authors":[{"name":"Dae-Woon Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae-Woon Lim","id":"37533200700"},{"name":"Seok-Joong Heo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seok-Joong Heo","id":"37555597900"},{"name":"Jong-Seon No","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Seon No","id":"37266106800"},{"name":"Habong Chung","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Hongik University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Habong Chung","id":"37335688400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"1621422","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":503},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interleaved codes","Wireless LAN","Nonlinear distortion","Bit error rate","Partial transmit sequences","Quadrature phase shift keying","Hamming distance","Communication standards","Land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Hadamard matrices","m-sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase sequence set","OFDM scheme","crest factor reduction","orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing","Hamming distance","cyclic Hadamard matrix","m-sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crest factor","cyclic Hadamard matrix","orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","phase sequence","selected mapping (SLM)"]}],"abstract":"The crest factor distribution of orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) symbol sequences is evaluated, and it is shown that OFDM symbol sequences with a short period are expected to have a high crest factor.

Only when properly mounted can the antenna operate at the highest possible efficiency. Furthermore, the antenna can not be expected to stand up under the physical abuse encountered unless correctly mounted. In the past, a tripod mount was used when an antenna of the order of five to seven feet in length was to be mounted on a vehicle. Support at three points minimized the danger of bending the body or fender of the vehicle and provided an extremely sturdy mount. However, it did not allow rod flexure, and resulted in very high breakage. In addition, the tripod arms had the disadvantage of catching debris and thus lowering the antenna efficiency by adding a secondary path to ground. The objections to the tripod mount were overcome with the swivel mount, which consists of a split ball mounted on a flat insulating plate. An outstanding feature of the swivel is its ability to mount the antenna vertically on any surface regardless of the angle of the surface with the vertical. A low inertia rod with a maximum stress taper is usually used in conjunction with the mount.

The constant of the spring should be low enough so that an appreciable part of the bending moment is bypassed from the antenna rod.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621537/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1952","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1952","publicationDate":"Feb. 1952","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","volume":"PGVC-1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mobile antennas for vehicular communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile antennas for vehicular communications","sourcePdf":"01621537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063756S","chronDate":"Feb.  1952","isNumber":"33969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10783","articleId":"1621537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1952","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1621542,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

This comparison indicates that 450 mc is superior transmissionwise to the presently used 150-mc band in urban and suburban areas. In fact a broad optimum in performance falls in the neighborhood of 500 mc. It is concluded that this range of frequencies would be well suited for providing coverage to meet the large scale needs which are anticipated in and around metropolitan areas. Although higher frequencies are less desirable, the tests indicate that 900 mc is somewhat to be favored over 150 mc from a transmission standpoint if full use is made of the possible antenna gain. Above this frequency, transmission performance falls off even assuming the maximum practical antenna gain. Transmission at 3700 mc suffers an additional impairment in that the fluctuations in received carrier level occur at an audible rate as the mobile unit moves at normal speeds. It is concluded that while transmission above roughly 1000 mc for these services is not impossible, it would be decidedly more difficult to employ these frequencies satisfactorily.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGVC.1953.32856","doi":"10.1109/PGVC.1953.32856","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Vehicular Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/10783/33971/01621559.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Vehicular Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of mobile radio transmission at 150, 450, 900, and 3700 mc","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of mobile radio transmission at 150, 450, 900, and 3700 mc","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1621559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1953","isJournal":true,"volume":"PGVC-3","publicationDate":"June 1953","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1953","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of mobile radio transmission at 150, 450, 900, and 3700 mc","sourcePdf":"01621559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028608S","chronDate":"June  1953","isNumber":"33971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10783","citationCount":"49","articleId":"1621559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1621560,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Basic diversity methods are first reviewed in the framework of mobile propagation effects, and then specific techniques are compared from the standpoint of transmitter power required to achieve a certain performance. Criteria of comparison used included baseband SNR while moving and reliability when the vehicle stops at random. System parameters are type and order of diversity and transmission bandwidth. Tradeoffs between performance properties and system parameters are indicated. The calculations show that relatively modest use of diversity techniques can afford savings in transmitter power of 10-20 dB. For example, at a range of 2 mi, to obtain 30-dB baseband SNR while moving and 99.9-percent reliability when stopped requires a transmitted power of 8 W for a conventional FM system with no diversity. Two-branch selection diversity provides the same performance for a transmitter power of only 300 mW.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Land mobile radio","Diversity methods","Radio transmitters","Power system reliability","Baseband","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave propagation","Vehicles","Bandwidth"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622065","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1971.23485","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34005/01622065.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1971.23485","startPage":"81","endPage":"92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of specific space diversity techniques for reduction of fast fading in UHF mobile radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of specific space diversity techniques for reduction of fast fading in UHF mobile radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1971","volume":"20","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 1971","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of specific space diversity techniques for reduction of fast fading in UHF mobile radio systems","sourcePdf":"01622065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027526S","chronDate":"Nov.  1971","isNumber":"34005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"55","articleId":"1622065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1622095,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

Spectral efficiency is defined to be the number of mobile users that can be served per MHz of spectrum in a core urban area, while economic efficiency is the average system cost per mobile. Both efficiencies vary with the type of usage, hence they are calculated for three major usages-mobile telephone service, dispatch service emergency, and dispatch service nonemergency. Services are described via seven \"service parameters,\" namely call holding time (average), tolerable average wait for channel access, peak busy hour utilization per mobile, audio quality (S/N), noise levels tolerable, and service range.

This paper analyzes the factors that cause paging errors due to interference when the signaling format consists of audio tones sent simultaneously from two FM transmitters. The factors considered are: drift in carrier and modulation frequencies, and misequalization of land-line amplitude and audio delay. The following results are shown: 1) the interference errors are eliminated if the land lines are amplitude and phase equalized, 2)if the lines are not equalized but the modulation frequencies are equal, then the interference errors can be decreased by an order of magnitude if the transmitters are mistuned such that their difference carrier frequency is just greater than the modulation tone filter bandwidth in the receiver, and 3) if the modulation frequencies are slightly different, then the interference errors can be decreased somewhat by misequalizing the modulation indicies. It is then concluded that if the land lines are not equalized and the signaling tones are not exactly equal, the interference errors cannot be eliminated, but can be decreased by properly aligning the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622186/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1973","publicationDate":"Nov. 1973","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","volume":"22","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of radio paging errors in multitransmitter mobile systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of radio paging errors in multitransmitter mobile systems","sourcePdf":"01622186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029922S","chronDate":"Nov.  1973","isNumber":"34015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1622186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1622200,"authors":[{"name":"D.O.

The measurements were conducted at a quiet site where several single stationary vehicles were operated at engine speeds corresponding to idle and cruise. Measurements were also made at two distances near a freeway, for light traffic (approximately 20 vehicles per min) and for heavy traffic (approximately 45 vehicles per min). The principal instrumentation consisted of several phase-stable receivers with coherent quadrature detectors whose outputs were digitized at a rate of 200 samples per quadrature component per second and recorded on magnetic tape for computer processing. About 10 min of data (about 120 000 samples) were obtained during each measurement. The computer plotted the APD on a Rayleigh scale in dB relative to thermal noise and calculated the mean noise power available at the antenna terminals (related by a constant to the noise factor F\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</inf>\n) and V\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</inf>\n--the ratio in dB of rms to average voltage.

Near a freeway, most of the noise is contributed by a small number of very noisy vehicles. The APD's for various situations are strikingly similar; all show that most of the noise envelope samples in a measurement are Rayleigh distributed. A small percentage of the noise samples do not follow the Rayleigh distribution, but are of higher amplitude. This percentage is higher for an engine at cruise speed than at idle speed, and higher for heavy traffic than for light traffic.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1974.23576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34019/01622226.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1974.23576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34019","startPage":"72","endPage":"83","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements of amplitude probability distributions and power of automobile ignition noise at HF","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measurements of amplitude probability distributions and power of automobile ignition noise at HF","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1974","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements of amplitude probability distributions and power of automobile ignition noise at HF","sourcePdf":"01622226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043478S","chronDate":"Aug.  1974","isNumber":"34019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"37","articleId":"1622226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1622250,"authors":[{"name":"J.I.

In all cases unmodulated carrier waves were radiated from aerials atop tall buildings or prominent terrain features and detected using a vehicle-mounted receiver. These measurements have provided the basis for an analysis of the factors affecting the transmission loss in urban/suburban areas which, in turn, has enabled a propagation prediction model to be constructed. Close agreement between measured and predicted path losses has been found for the various terrain situations investigated. The statistical prediction errors produced by the proposed model for the three British cities analyzed are shown to be similar in magnitude to those obtained using an extrapolation of the Okumura method. Because the proposed model is much less complex and procedurally simpler, it is recommended for use, in the first instance, in British cities.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1977.23700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34034/01622400.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1977.23700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34034","startPage":"313","endPage":"323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile radio propagation in British cities at frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mobile radio propagation in British cities at frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1977","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile radio propagation in British cities at frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands","sourcePdf":"01622400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046331S","chronDate":"Nov.  1977","isNumber":"34034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1622400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1622403,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Representing the human body by a simplified lossy dielectric structure, the influence of the body on the performance of the antenna is investigated in detail, and it is shown how antenna impedance, gain, and radiation patterns can be calculated taking the presence of the body into account. For very short antennas the results indicate that radiation from the body may dominate over the radiation contributed by the antenna itself, and that the presence of the body can increase the antenna efficiency considerably, indicating that even very short antennas may provide acceptable radiation efficiencies. The results of the theoretical work are supported by measurements on practical antennas. Quarter-wave and short antennas of the helical type are compared with respect to efficiency and radiation patterns at 80, 160, and 450 MHz, and it is demonstrated how the physical length of the antenna affects the antenna performance.

The multiplexer used in HCMTS consists of 16 high Q cavity resonators which act as highly selective bandpass filters. These cavity resonators are tied together at their common junction by lengths of transmission line which are three-quarters of a wavelength long at the center frequency of the HCMTS transmit band (880 MHz). The cavity resonators are made of invar to provide temperature stability and are copper plated and gold flashed to provide proper electrical and environmental properties. This multiplexer provides a nominal loss of 3 dB from any input to the output and an isolation of about 20 dB between any input sources. A photograph of a complete multiplexer is shown in Figure 1. Because of the complex nature of this multiplexer and the significant cost of building prototype models, it is most desirable to develop a method for simulating the characteristics of the multiplexer. There are many applications where simulated results are useful including the determination of the optimum loaded Q for the individual cavity resonators, the determination of heat dissipation throughout the device and the study of changes due to temperature variations. A computer simulation for the multiplexer has been developed and will be described along with results in the above areas.","doi":"10.1109/VTC.1977.1622427","publicationTitle":"27th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"27th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10796/34035/01622427.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1977.1622427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer simulation of HCMTS 16 channel multiplexer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 1977","displayDocTitle":"Computer simulation of HCMTS 16 channel multiplexer","isConference":true,"volume":"27","publicationDate":"1977","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 1977","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer simulation of HCMTS 16 channel multiplexer","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01622427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031848S","chronDate":"16-18 March 1977","isNumber":"34035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10796","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1622427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1622437,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

In this cellular system the total coverage area is divided into a grid of small hexagonal cells. The radius of each cell is planned to be eight miles for startup systems, but might eventually shrink to one mile (by cell splitting) as traffic density increases. Mobiles located within the cells are serviced by low-power 850 MHz FM transceivers contained within cell-sites which are situated at alternate corners of each hexagonal cell. Two types of antennas may be used at a cell site. A startup system would employ omnidirectional antennas, since for this case traffic density is low and it is important to minimize first cost. Mature, high density systems, would employ three sets of directional antennas at alternate corners of each cell site, arranged such that the 120deg; beam from each antenna set would illuminate the interior of the corresponding cell. All cell sites are interfaced with one central control and switching center, the Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO), by means of four-wire voice and data trunks. A call from the DDD telephone network is first routed to the MTSO, then over a voice trunk to the cell site which is to serve the mobile, and finally over an available radio channel to the called mobile. At call setup the mobile is located by measuring its received signal strength and range. During the call the mobile may be relocated several times a minute. If the mobile enters a new cell it is \"handed-off\" to a new cell site and radio channel by digital commands from the MTSO.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34035","publicationTitle":"27th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"27th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10796/34035/01622437.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VTC.1977.1622437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1977.1622437","startPage":"166","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A description of the Bell system HCMTS cell-site radio and control hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622437/","displayDocTitle":"A description of the Bell system HCMTS cell-site radio and control hardware","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 1977","isConference":true,"volume":"27","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"1977","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A description of the Bell system HCMTS cell-site radio and control hardware","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01622437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028341S","chronDate":"16-18 March 1977","isNumber":"34035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10796","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1622437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1622446,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

The measurements of temperature increment due to radiation were performed with a digital thermometer having a sensitivity of 0.01\u00b0C. Temperature measurements on the parallelepipedal phantom have shown that the penetrating power densities in the simulated tissue are substantially lower than what could be expected from an incident plane wave with the same E-field intensity. The physical reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the strong fields of static nature emanating from a VHF helical antenna (commonly used with portable radios) are normally rather than tangentially directed to the surface of the phantom. These fields practically collapse at the air-body interface because of the high complex dielectric constant of human flesh. The results of the measurements performed on the head phantom have shown that a 6-W portable radio with a helical antenna held at 0.2 in from the operator's mouth causes very little heating of the simulated biological tissue (less than 0.1\u00b0C is highest temperature increase for one minute exposure). The maximum power density penetrating the dummy is less than 1 mW/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nin the middle forehead. No detectable temperature increase is present in the immediate eye area. This is because in normal use, the eyes of the operator are exposed to the relatively low fields at the base of the antenna. A health hazard is present if the user places the tip of the antenna in the immediate vicinity of the eye (less than a 0.2-in distance) and then operates the transmitter. In this case, the possibility of damage is greatly reduced by a thick insulating cap at the tip of the antenna.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1978.23723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34037/01622464.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1978.23723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heating of biological tissue in the induction field of VHF portable radio transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622464/","displayDocTitle":"Heating of biological tissue in the induction field of VHF portable radio transmitters","volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1978","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heating of biological tissue in the induction field of VHF portable radio transmitters","sourcePdf":"01622464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033991S","chronDate":"May  1978","isNumber":"34037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","articleId":"1622464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1622465,"authors":[{"name":"F.

One well-known principle for selecting such an assignment sequence is to rank the channel requirements of the various nets in descending order of \"assignment difficulty.\" This paper describes an easily automated heuristic assignment technique in which the channel requirements that prove themselves to be \"difficult,\" through repeated failures to be assigned channels, rise rapidly toward the top of the list of requirements. The heuristic technique is useful in solving complex frequency-assignment problems that involve cochannel, adjacent-channel, spurious and intermodulation interference; nonrepetitive zone structures; fixed pre-existing frequency assignments; and frequency-resource lists that contain gaps and vary from zone to zone.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1978.23724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34037/01622465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1978.23724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34037","startPage":"57","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heuristic technique for assigning frequencies to mobile radio nets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic technique for assigning frequencies to mobile radio nets","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1978","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1978","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic technique for assigning frequencies to mobile radio nets","sourcePdf":"01622465.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074917S","chronDate":"May  1978","isNumber":"34037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"122","articleId":"1622465","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1622472,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

The deposited RF energy was evaluated by temperature measurements. The portable radio used in the tests had a 6-W experimental transmitter operating at 840 MHz. Two different antennas were tested for energy deposition: a sleeve dipole and a resonant whip. The two antennas have given substantially different results indicating different field structures near the two radiators. The experiments with flat slabs have shown that the sleeve dipole deposits higher levels of power density than the resonant whip in the near field although the length of the latter radiator is about half the size of the former. The temperature profiles generated by both antennas inside the head of the simulated operator indicate the presence of a \"hot spot\" about 1 in below the surface of the temporal bone. This phenomenon was not detected previously at lower frequencies. The short antenna exposes the eye of the operator to more intense power deposition than the sleeve dipole. The temperature increases measured during the investigation are so small that no thermal damage to tissue should be caused by normal use of the portable radio.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1978.23746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34039/01622487.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1978.23746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34039","startPage":"174","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy deposition in simulated human operators of 800-MHz portable transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy deposition in simulated human operators of 800-MHz portable transmitters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622487/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1978","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy deposition in simulated human operators of 800-MHz portable transmitters","sourcePdf":"01622487.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029096S","chronDate":"Nov.  1978","isNumber":"34039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"37","articleId":"1622487","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1622488,"authors":[{"name":"V.

It is experimently verified that an offset carrier frequency strategy is well suited to the realization of this system. Simulation test results are presented which determine the design parameters.

The technique uses a very large set of frequency-hopped signals which are designed for minimal mutual interference. No synchronization of the mobile units is required, and each user is permanently assigned his own signal, which serves as an identifying signal and as a carrier for the biphase-modulated digital message. The spectral efficiency of the spread-spectrum system is analyzed and compared with the efficiencies of developmental FM/channel reuse schemes currently under construction in the U.S. and Japan. It is concluded that even with relatively simple speech digitization schemes, the efficiency of the spread-spectrum scheme may exceed those of the narrow-band schemes by a factor of almost five. More ambitious bit-rate-reducing speech digitization methods could improve still further on these figures. Additional benefits of the spread-spectrum scheme include immunity from fading and interference, more consistent speech quality, simpler system control algorithms, and more flexible blocking properties under overload conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622499/","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A spread-spectrum technique for high-capacity mobile communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spread-spectrum technique for high-capacity mobile communications","sourcePdf":"01622499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0335S","chronDate":"Nov.  1978","isNumber":"34039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"223","articleId":"1622499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1622522,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

A considerable amount of research and development of \"daisy chain\" radio repeater systems using leaky transmission lines has been accomplished in the United Kingdom by Dr. D. J. R. Martin of the National Coal Board's Mining and Research Establishment and Mr. Q. V. Davis of the University of Surrey. The basic \"daisy chain\" repeater system is similar in concept to coaxial cable telephone repeater and submarine communications cable systems which use amplifiers spaced at intervals to compensate for the attenuation of the cable. London Transport also has developed a prototype \"daisy chain\" radio repeater system which was commissioned into regular operation on a three mile section of the Bakerloo Underground railway in August, 1977. This system uses twenty-two 400 milliwatt repeater amplifiers spaced approximately 500 meters apart along leaky coaxial transmission lines which are supported from the walls of the subway tunnels and under the platforms of passenger stations. The other half of the Bakerloo Underground is equipped with three conventional twenty-five watt base stations feeding tee sections of leaky coaxial transmission line. While both systems perform satisfactorily, the section that is equipped with \"daisy chain\" amplifiers does not have transition zones between the tee sections of leaky cable, requires fewer telephone control lines and uses a simpler control system. By combining the techniques of the on-channel signal booster and the \"daisy chain\" repeater system using selective filters and wide band linear amplifiers it should be possible to extend signals received from base stations above ground into subways. This would satisfy the requirements for providing, at a much reduced cost, multi-channel radio communications for not only the transit system but also police, fire, para-medical and paging services.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio communication","Repeaters","Transmission lines","Coaxial cables","Communication cables","Telephony","Power cables","Coaxial components","Base stations","Control systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTC.1978.1622543","publicationTitle":"28th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"28th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10797/34040/01622543.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1978.1622543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio communication in subways and mines through repeater amplifiers and leaky transmission lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio communication in subways and mines through repeater amplifiers and leaky transmission lines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622543/","isConference":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"1978","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 1978","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio communication in subways and mines through repeater amplifiers and leaky transmission lines","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"01622543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027372S","chronDate":"22-24 March 1978","isNumber":"34040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10797","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1622543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1622566,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

This excess path loss is measured as a function of (1) local environment, (2) vehicle heading, (3) link frequency, (4) satellite elevation angle, and (5) street side. An excess loss model developed from the data shows that the first two parameters dominate. Excess path loss on the order of 25 dB is typical in urban situations (90% temporal/spatial coverage), but decreases to under 10 dB in suburban/rural areas. Spaced antenna selection diversity is found to provide only a slight decrease (4 dB typically) in the urban excess path loss observed. Level crossing rates are depressed in satellite links relative to those of Rayleighfaded terrestrial links, but increases in average fade durations tend to offset that advantage. The measurements show that the excess path loss difference between 860 MHz links and 1550 MHz links is generally negligible.","doi":"10.1109/VTC.1979.1622714","publicationTitle":"29th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"29th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10798/34045/01622714.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1979.1622714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34045","startPage":"342","endPage":"347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Land-mobile satellite excess path loss measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Land-mobile satellite excess path loss measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 March 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622714/","conferenceDate":"27-30 March 1979","isConference":true,"volume":"29","publicationDate":"1979","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Land-mobile satellite excess path loss measurements","confLoc":"Arlington Heights, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01622714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02769S","chronDate":"27-30 March 1979","isNumber":"34045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10798","articleId":"1622714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1622730,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Two test vehicles have been designed, manufactured, and flight-tested. The first test vehicle, HSST-01, marked a maximum speed of 307.8 km/h on a 1300-m long test track in February, 1978, whereas the second test vehicle, HSST-02, has demonstrated boarding test flights successfully to an aggregated total of abut 1500 passengers since April, 1978, onward. The HSST-01 weighs one ton, is 4 m long, designed for high-speed testing, and incorporates eight electromagnets and a LIM with a maximum thrust of 300 kg. The levitating power supply is taken from the batteries carried on board the vehicle, and the three-phase VVVF power for the LIM propulsion is supplied from the wayside power lines through the power collector. The nine-seated HSST-02 has a loaded weight of 2.3 tons. Major items of additional functions realized in the HSST-02 include: 1) the electromagnets are fitted to the flexible chassis for better riding comfort by incorporating mechanical suspension between the chassis and the body, and 2) with the continuous levitation, the power for the LIM is rectified and supplied to the electromagnets jointly serving with the batteries carried on board. In light of the test results obtained so far, it is shown that the predicted performances of the levitation magnets, LIM, and the power collector system have been satisfactorily established, and that there would be no major technical problems in the course of our future development for implementation of the HSST system toward commercial services. The design of a preoperational test vehicle is now underway, and its test flight is scheduled to he initiated in 1980.

In this system a paging receiver in the overlapping area receives several RF signals transmitted from different base stations. When frequency-shift keying (FSK) is used as a modulation method, experimental test results have already shown that the timing of each RF signal should be synchronized as closely as possible, but that the carrier frequency of each transmitter should be set following a certain offset assignment. The signal transmission performance in a multipath fading environment can then be markedly improved. The cause of this improvement effect is theoretically analyzed. It is clarified that the improvement effect is caused by transforming the probability distribution of time-averaged signal power.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1980.23826","startPage":"87","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34046/01622739.pdf","endPage":"95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1980.23826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622739/","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical studies of a simulcast digital radio paging system using a carrier frequency offset strategy","volume":"29","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical studies of a simulcast digital radio paging system using a carrier frequency offset strategy","sourcePdf":"01622739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021644S","chronDate":"Feb 1980","isNumber":"34046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1622739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1622760,"authors":[{"name":"F.H.

A new modulation scheme intended to realize simulcast digital transmission is described. In this method, a modulation signal is made by superimposing a specific wave on an ordinary rectangular digital wave. The two conditions necessary for obtaining a diversity effect equivalent to the maximal-ratio combining are mathematically derived. The specific waves for the various transmitters may be sinusoidal waves having a frequency equal to the original bit rate, and phases which differ from one transmitter to another. In order to clarify the feasibility of this technique, experimental simulation tests have been performed in the 900-MHz band in a two-transmitter configuration. It is proved that this modulation scheme, in comparison with the carrier-frequency offset strategy, not only gives the same amount of improvement in digital signaling in an overlapped area, but also makes the allowable carrier frequency drift more than ten times larger.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"260","endPage":"270","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1980.23850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1980.23850","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34047/01622763.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new modulation scheme for multitransmitter simulcast digital mobile radio communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1980","displayDocTitle":"A new modulation scheme for multitransmitter simulcast digital mobile radio communication","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"May 1980","volume":"29","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new modulation scheme for multitransmitter simulcast digital mobile radio communication","sourcePdf":"01622763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015635S","chronDate":"May  1980","isNumber":"34047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1622763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1622772,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This model fits very well to the recorded data.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1981.23882","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1981.23882","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34052/01622882.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of a digital mobile radio channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of a digital mobile radio channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1981","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of a digital mobile radio channel","sourcePdf":"01622882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030341S","chronDate":"May  1981","isNumber":"34052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"97","articleId":"1622882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1622891,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

Spectrum Efficiency can also be described in terms of Communication Capacity of the system per unit bandwidth. To determine the number of users a system can support for a given grade of service, both aspects (traffic handling and communication) should be considered simultaneously. In the first part of this paper we examine the traffic capacity of cellular mobile radio systems with different channel assignment schemes. It is shown that cellular systems are superior to trunked systems with moderate frequency reuse but not without frequency reuse. However, with use of effective channel assignment schemes, cellular system's performance is close to that of trunked systems even without frequency reuse. Adaptive channel assignment schemes are examined. Adaptive shcemes are based on the fact that traffic intensity of the arrival process varies slowly with time. Therefore, channels can be assigned to take the maximum advantage of the random nature of the arrival process and the frequency reuse at a given time. Traffic capacity of the mobile radio system is examined which uses the same set of channels to service the different classes of users. One such example is the mobile radio system which provides voice-telephone and dispatch service on the same channels. Arrival process is assumed to be Poisson for both telephone and dispatch calls with different arrival rates. Service rates are also different for the telephone and dispatch calls. Blocked telephone calls are cleared from the system and blocked dispatch calls are delayed. Another example is a mobile radio system which services different classes of users with different service times and grades of service.","doi":"10.1109/VTC.1981.1622942","publicationTitle":"31st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"31st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10800/34055/01622942.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1981.1622942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel assignment schemes and traffic capacities of mobile radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1981","displayDocTitle":"Channel assignment schemes and traffic capacities of mobile radio systems","isConference":true,"volume":"31","publicationDate":"1981","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel assignment schemes and traffic capacities of mobile radio systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01622942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051233S","chronDate":"April 1981","isNumber":"34055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10800","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1622942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1622967,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In the case of CD, an exact and explicit BER formula for the maximal-ratio combining diversity (MRC) is obtained.

The algorithm uses flexible fixed channel assignment which enables the calls having all their nominal channels busy to borrow channels from the neighboring cells provided that co-channel interference will not result. The borrowed channel cannot be used in three interfering cells; therefore reassignment strategy is used when a call is terminated on a nominal channel to switch a call in progress in a borrowed channel to that nominal one and set free the borrowed channel in the three interfering cells. Thus the traffic carried on borrowed channels is minimized. Also different call switching strategies are proposed to give priority to some channels to be used by the nominal cells and other channels to be borrowed by neighboring cells. These strategies considerably reduce the blocking probability. A simulation study of the algorithm was carried out on 49 hexagonal zones having uniform traffic density. Also a combined telephone and dispatch traffic was included in the simulation study. The results showed that the new algorithm is better than the other channel assignment schemes. This can be applied in high capacity mobile communications systems to utilize the spectrum efficiently.","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34058/01622984.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1982.23924","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1982.23924","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1622984","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Mobile communication","Traffic control","Interchannel interference","Switches","Cells (biology)","FCC","Base stations","Vehicle dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1982","displayDocTitle":"A new frequency channel assignment algorithm in high capacity mobile communication systems","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 1982","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new frequency channel assignment algorithm in high capacity mobile communication systems","sourcePdf":"01622984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039956S","chronDate":"Aug.  1982","isNumber":"34058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"146","articleId":"1622984","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1622985,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The use of adaptive delta modulation (ADM) based on explicit transmission of the quantizer step size was proposed earlier for speech communication over such a channel. Two other variable step-size delta modulation (VSDM) schemes are presented, and their performance in a mobile radio environment is discussed. One of them is the constant factor delta modulation that uses one-bit memory and produces fast and instantaneous step-size changes. The other is the digitally controlled delta modulation (DCDM) that incorporates a new step-size adaptation strategy using seven bits of memory. In some cases, bit scrambling has been used. This is equivalent to scrambling (spreading out in time) the, clustered errors. Computer simulations providing values of coder parameters for satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios for band-limited speech signals and Gaussian noise are described. New hardware realizations are given that allow those parameters to vary smoothly for a wide range of sampling frequencies. Results of informal listening tests obtained with a mobile radio channel simulator are included. It is shown that for mobile radio, DCDM, as expected, is the better of the two coders. This is because it does not sacrifice its overload performance for the sake of error resistance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1982.23931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34059/01622991.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"165","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1982.23931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation of delta modulation of speech for mobile radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1982","displayDocTitle":"An investigation of delta modulation of speech for mobile radio","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1622991/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation of delta modulation of speech for mobile radio","sourcePdf":"01622991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036185S","chronDate":"Nov.  1982","isNumber":"34059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1622991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1623054,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

Here we compare the power control problem for the upstream and the downstream links and show that using simple algebra we can equalize the signal-to-interference ratio for each mobile in a given cell in both links and thereby increase the capacity by 30 to 100% compared with a system with no power control. We also show that the SIR values can be equalized system-wide for both link directions by means of a nontrivial eigenvalue problem, which results in a further capacity improvement of 10 to 15%.

This technique uses single sideband modulation with baseband processing in the form of amplitude companding and spectral shaping, along with a pilot signal which provides AGC, AFC, squelch and selective call functions. The resulting system performs as well as or better than commercial FM systems and uses only one-fifth the bandwidth. In this paper, an efficient algorithm which incorporates the various factors affecting the performance of a mobile radio system is developed, and used to compare the efficiency and service quality of both FM and ACSB radios. The ACSB radios have 1.5 to 2 times the range of an FM radio with equal power. With regards to adjacent channel interference, ACSB with 5 kHz channel separation performs as well as FM with 20 or 25 kHz separation. When both co-channel and adjacent channel interference are taken into account, ACSB is about 6 to 8 times more efficient than FM in terms of maximizing the number of users supported per MHz in a given service area.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio","Frequency modulation","Interchannel interference","Amplitude modulation","Protection","Automatic frequency control","Bandwidth","Channel spacing","Baseband","Signal processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTC.1983.1623162","publicationTitle":"33rd IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"33rd IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10802/34065/01623162.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1983.1623162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New directions in mobile radio spectrum efficiency - Amplitude companded sideband","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1623162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New directions in mobile radio spectrum efficiency - Amplitude companded sideband","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623162/","isConference":true,"volume":"33","publicationDate":"1983","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1983","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New directions in mobile radio spectrum efficiency - Amplitude companded sideband","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01623162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028873S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1983","isNumber":"34065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10802","articleId":"1623162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1623189,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

Deep fades arise due to the presence of many obstructions in the propagation path between the transmitter and receiver. One way to combat the effects of Rayleigh fading due to multipath propagation is to provide a diversity combiner in the mobile receiving system with two signals, each containing the same information, which fade independently of one another. Such a system can virtually eliminate deep fades from the receiver output. Described herein is a method of obtaining two diversity branches, with independent signals if so desired, from a single two-port antenna which is both well matched to the transponder and efficient over the land-mobile frequency band from 820- 890 MHz. A directive pattern is associated with each port. When operating with a direct wave, signal gain over an omnidirectional antenna is therefore possible.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1984.23990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1984.23990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34067/01623189.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The monopole slot as a two-port diversity antenna for UHF land-mobile radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1984","displayDocTitle":"The monopole slot as a two-port diversity antenna for UHF land-mobile radio systems","volume":"33","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The monopole slot as a two-port diversity antenna for UHF land-mobile radio systems","sourcePdf":"01623189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043566S","chronDate":"May  1984","isNumber":"34067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1623189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1623198,"authors":[{"name":"T.

With optimum combining, the signals received by the antennas are weighted and combined to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Thus, with cochannel interference, space diversity is used not only to combat Rayleigh fading of the desired signal (as with maximal ratio combining) but also to reduce the power of interfering signals at the receiver. We use analytical and computer simulation techniques to determine the performance of optimum combining when the received desired and interfering signals are subject to Rayleigh fading. Results show that optimum combining is significantly better than maximal ratio combining even when the number of interferers is greater than the number of antennas. Results for typical cellular mobile radio systems show that optimum combining increases the output signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver by several decibels. Thus, systems can require fewer base station antennas and/or achieve increased channel capacity through greater frequency reuse.

Full mathematical evaluations of the protocol referred to as \"random SFHMA\" are presented for the mobile-to-fixed-station channel, and some simulation results are given for the reverse channel. With realistic propagation parameters (\u03b1 = 3.5, \u03c3 = 8 dB) and with mobile power control, there can be as many as 87 radiotelephone users per cell in a 25 MHz band.

In the mobile radio environment, there happens inevitably a fast Rayleigh fading which causes random FM. The phase error of the reference signal due to random FM will degrade the bit error rate (BER) performance, even if the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high. In the realization of reliable mobile communication, removal of this random FM is an unavoidable theme. Proposed strategy is to transmit a sounding continuous wave (CW) together with a BPSK signal, each phase being kept orthogonal and each power being kept the same. This CW wave is also used as the reference signal in coherent reception. The BER performance of this system is worse by 3 dB than that of the coherent BPSK in a slow Rayleigh fading environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BPSK system with sounder to combat Rayleigh fading in mobile radio communication","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1985.24032","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34071/01623291.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1985.24032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1623291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1985","displayDocTitle":"BPSK system with sounder to combat Rayleigh fading in mobile radio communication","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BPSK system with sounder to combat Rayleigh fading in mobile radio communication","sourcePdf":"01623291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046151S","chronDate":"Feb 1985","isNumber":"34071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1623291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1623298,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Some emerging radio systems, e.g., cellular mobile radio, cordless telephone, and radio paging, have begun to penetrate this frontier. However, each of these approaches only partially satisfies portable communication needs. That is, the approaches do not provide overall portable communication service. Some of the problems involved and the technologies and system configurations needed for an advanced radio communications system are discussed. The goal for the system is to provide high quality ubiquitous service to low power portable radiotelephones and data terminals. Frequency reuse radio system configurations applicable to residential and large building environments will be described along with multipath and other 800 MHz radio propagation limitations. The system would use fixed radio ports attached to the telephone network and spaced about 2000 ft in residential areas. The residential ports would have antenna heights of less than 30 ft. The horizontal spacing of ports within large buildings would be 200 ft or more. In service areas, more than 99 percent radio link availability would be provided for 5 mW portable transmitters.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1985.24047","startPage":"117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34073/01623306.pdf","endPage":"121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1985.24047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623306/","displayDocTitle":"Universal portable radio communications","volume":"34","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal portable radio communications","sourcePdf":"01623306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036983S","chronDate":"Aug.  1985","isNumber":"34073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"69","articleId":"1623306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1623307,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Loo","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Chun Loo","id":"37357199200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"1623307","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":425,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":1998},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"A statistical model for a land mobile satellite link is described.

Significant improvements in size and power consumption have been achieved using a predistortion (PD) circuit to compensate for third-order intermodulation (IM) distortion generated in the power amplifier. This predistortion circuit features a simple configuration and easy adjustment, as well as high distortion reduction performance. The circuit configuration is derived from an analysis based on a complex power series representation of input-output nonlinearities for microwave transistor amplifiers. This analysis shows that two kinds of nonlinearities, AM-AM and AM-PM conversions, are uniquely related through the third-order distortion phase, In addition, an automatically controlled predistortion system is introduced to establish an adjustment and maintenance-free compensator. Using the developed predistortion circuit, a stable distortion reduction of more than 20 dB per 25 MHz bandwidth has been attained.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1985.24057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34074/01623316.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1985.24057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cuber predistortion linearizer for relay equipment in 800 MHz band land mobile telephone system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1623316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623316/","displayDocTitle":"Cuber predistortion linearizer for relay equipment in 800 MHz band land mobile telephone system","volume":"34","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cuber predistortion linearizer for relay equipment in 800 MHz band land mobile telephone system","sourcePdf":"01623316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025593S","chronDate":"Nov.  1985","isNumber":"34074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"92","articleId":"1623316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1623317,"authors":[{"name":"E.

At shorter distances the signal sometimes experiences multipath fading. The level varies slowly as the aircraft passes in and out of fresnel zones. When the aircraft is over a ground station, the signal experiences rapid fading similar to land mobile systems. At 900 MHz, with a limited fade margin, the radio horizon is approximately equal to the optical horizon.

One of the more recent of these techniques, namely the tone calibration technique (TCT), suggests transmitting double sideband modulation with the pilot tone located at the center of its spectrum where the amplitude and phase characteristics of the channel are most stable. To \"make room\" for the pilot in the presence of the Doppler shift, the equivalent low-pass data sidebands must be shaped so as to have zero response in the neighborhood of dc. Other techniques such as transparent tone-in-band (TTIB) similarly \"notch out\" a hole in the center of the data spectrum for location of the pilot. An alternate possibility which is at the same time much more bandwidth efficient than TCT is a dual-pilot tone calibration technique (DPTCT) that symmetrically locates a pair of pilots outside the data spectrum near the band edges of the channel. The operation and performance of DPTCT are analyzed, and its effectiveness is compared to that of the single tone TCT technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-pilot tone calibration technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1986.24072","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34077/01623385.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1986.24072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1623385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","displayDocTitle":"Dual-pilot tone calibration technique","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"May 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-pilot tone calibration technique","sourcePdf":"01623385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019582S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"34077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1623385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1623389,"authors":[{"name":"Daehyoung Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Daehyoung Hong","id":"37289203600"},{"name":"S.S.

In the first priority scheme considered, a fixed number of channels in each cell are reserved exclusively for handoff calls.

The analyses have revealed that BER performance markedly depends on the choice of sample timing, and also an interesting fact that BPSK is outstanding in the multipath-distortion tolerance, if coupled with adaptive sampling, and its BER curves remain almost the same as that of frequency-flat fading as long as multipath delay difference is less than a bit interval.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1986.24087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34079/01623400.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1986.24087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of sample timing on bit error rate performance in a multipath fading channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","displayDocTitle":"The effect of sample timing on bit error rate performance in a multipath fading channel","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","volume":"35","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of sample timing on bit error rate performance in a multipath fading channel","sourcePdf":"01623400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026327S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"34079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1623400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1623413,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

The application of ALOHA to short range (indoor or mobile) radio systems containing mobile terminals that send packets to a central base station is studied. In such systems, terminal-to-base distances can be vastly different and there can be pronounced shadowing. This gives rise to a capture effect at the receiver, where the packet arriving with the highest energy has a good chance of being detected accurately, even when other packets are present. It is well known that this capture effect improves the throughput and delay characteristics of the system as a whole. One of the principal findings is that even the user with the weakest signal shares in these improvements. This result is derived for the realistic case in which each terminal has a buffer to store packets that arrive while the terminal is waiting to transmit packets that were destroyed in earlier collisions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The near/far effect in local ALOHA radio communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1987.24093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34081/01623486.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1987.24093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1623486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","displayDocTitle":"The near/far effect in local ALOHA radio communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The near/far effect in local ALOHA radio communications","sourcePdf":"01623486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035642S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"34081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"158","articleId":"1623486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1623488,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed modulation scheme employs a continuous-wave (CW) tone to calibrate the mobile channel against the multipath-induced phase uncertainties. This technique is applicable to quaternary phase shift keying as well as to more complicated signal constellations such as M-ary phase shift keyed schemes. The advantages of tone calibration are: 1) robustness of the receiver and 2) elimination of the link dependent error floor. Furthermore, since the CW tone can also be used for coherent signal demodulation, carrier phase acquisition can be achieved within a bit time. This property is particularly attractive when a burst of data with a short burst length has to be detected. This radio technique is useful for both the terrestrial mobile and the newer satellite-aided mobile communication (SAMC) services.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1987.24100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34082/01623493.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1987.24100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile digital communications via tone calibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623493/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1987","displayDocTitle":"Mobile digital communications via tone calibration","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1987","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile digital communications via tone calibration","sourcePdf":"01623493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033258S","chronDate":"May  1987","isNumber":"34082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"81","articleId":"1623493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1623495,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Two kinds of transmit power control methods are considered. One retains area mean power at the receiver constant and the other retains local mean power constant. For single-cell trunked systems, it has been shown how spectrum efficiency is limited by the required traffic quality or permitable adjacent channel interference. A narrower channel spaced system shows superiority to wide-band systems, if an adjacent channel interference protection ratio is lower than about -40 dB and a few percent interference probability is permitted. On comparing cellular systems, superiority in spectrum efficiency is determined by the product of protection ratio and channel spacing.

If the fading frequency is much higher than the loop bandwidth, the ensemble average of p(t) over fading samples is used to recover the timing.

The mutual resistance condition offers a powerful design tool, and examples of new mobile diversity antennas are discussed along with some existing designs.","doi":"10.1109/T-VT.1987.24115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-VT.1987.24115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/34084/01623508.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna diversity in mobile communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Antenna diversity in mobile communications","volume":"36","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623508/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna diversity in mobile communications","sourcePdf":"01623508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096548S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"34084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"996","articleId":"1623508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1623510,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Several kinds of land mobile earth stations are provided for the experiments. G/T and EIRP of these earth stations range from -20dBK to -18dBK and from 6dBW to 20dBW respectively. Automobile earth stations with voice or data terminal employ ACSSB and 2.4kbps BPSK-SSMA as the modulation technique. A hand-held earth station is prepared as bi-directional low speed message communication terminal which employ 100bps Digital FM (CPFSK). Field tests will be carried out from the autumn of 1987.

The fading model has the structure of a Rician model except that the line-of-sight component is subjected to a lognormal transformation. This models shadow fading due to foliage attenuation. The multi-h codes are considered under conditions of perfect and partial coherence. The phase jitter due to fading is found to be a major impairment to system performance. A fast fading assumption is used with system fading bandwidths of 5 to 10 percent of the baud rate. The fading spectrum follows a third-order-Butterworth spectral shaping and uses fading model parameters based on measured data. The system average bit error probability is determined via a digital computer simulation on an additive white Gaussian noise channel with received signal fading.","doi":"10.1109/VTC.1987.1623545","publicationTitle":"37th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"37th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10806/34085/01623545.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1987.1623545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34085","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of binary multi-h modulation for fast fading, shadowed, mobile satellite communication channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1623545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of binary multi-h modulation for fast fading, shadowed, mobile satellite communication channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623545/","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 1987","isConference":true,"volume":"37","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of binary multi-h modulation for fast fading, shadowed, mobile satellite communication channels","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01623545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055602S","chronDate":"1-3 June 1987","isNumber":"34085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10806","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1623545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1623579,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

This combining is accomplished using resonant filters which are mechanically tuned. Changing frequency assignments is not easily done. A significant improvement in cellular system performance can be achieved by using a linear amplifier in combination with a broad band passive combiner. In the present system, each individual signal has its' own separate power amplifier. The outputs from these are combined at high power by using frequency isolation to reduce losses. With the linear amplifier, the combining is done at low power where the losses can be tolerated. The combined signals are then amplified by a single linear amplifier to bring them to the transmit power level. The linear amplifier combiner arrangement essentially eliminates the rigid frequency restrictions which now exist. Channel assignments can be changed as required without mechanical tuning. The channel spacing limitation required by the existing combiners is also eliminated. The number of signals which can be transmitted from one antenna is now limited only by total power consideration. The linear amplifier also permits modulation schemes which make more efficient use of the available spectrum.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1987.1623579","publicationTitle":"37th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"37th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10806/34085/01623579.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"423","doi":"10.1109/VTC.1987.1623579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear amplifier combiner","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 1987","displayDocTitle":"Linear amplifier combiner","isConference":true,"volume":"37","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 1987","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623579/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear amplifier combiner","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01623579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026966S","chronDate":"1-3 June 1987","isNumber":"34085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10806","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1623579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1623593,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper proposes a new concept of a mobile communication system based on the deployment of decentralized autonomous radio link control with decentralized base stations (DCM system: Decentralized Control architecture Mobile communication system). After presenting the service conditions and the system objectives, it gives a description of a basic DCM system, which includes the system configuration, radio system, and control architecture. The concept of autonomous radio link control that embodies the system is then discussed. One specific manifestation called ESCORT, that realizes autonomous radio link control, is then described. The concluding section will show the prospects for future development of this system and discuss additional technical problems that still must be overcome.","doi":"10.1109/VTC.1987.1623605","displayPublicationTitle":"37th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10806/34085/01623605.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC.1987.1623605","publicationTitle":"37th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"579","endPage":"586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new mobile communication system using autonomous radio link control with decentralized base stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1623605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 1987","displayDocTitle":"A new mobile communication system using autonomous radio link control with decentralized base stations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623605/","isConference":true,"volume":"37","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new mobile communication system using autonomous radio link control with decentralized base stations","confLoc":"Tampa, Florida, USA","sourcePdf":"01623605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042522S","chronDate":"1-3 June 1987","isNumber":"34085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10806","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1623605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":1623654,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Chen","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Kan Chen","id":"37087516230"},{"name":"S.E.

Future direction of this research focus will also be discussed. The critical test for Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) is whether an individual driver with an appropriately equipped vehicle will get intelligent and safe advice on traffic diversion from his originally chosen route after a congestion-causing incident is detected and verified. Such advice should take into account not only current traffic conditions but also anticipated delay that may occur before the driver reaches his destination. Therefore, the Michigan IVHS research on traffic modeling and route optimization has focused on anticipatory route guidance. The anticipatory guidance system routes the vehicles by minimizing time-dependent link costs incurred by the driver. A novel dynamic programming approach has been used to take advantage of the time-dependent characteristics of the minimal travel-time solution to reduce computation load. The computation of routes is accomplished in the vehicle so that the driver will have complete and private control of not only the objective function, but also the constraints, in the computation for his optimum route. The information to be provided from the infrastructure is a set of anticipated link costs, updated periodically, to reflect current system demand and unexpected traffic incidents. Preliminary analysis has suggested that, to minimize communication load, under certain conditions, all link costs (not just exceptional ones) should be transmitted and appropriate data compression techniques should be used. Since diversion recommendations are generated within the vehicle, no matter where the vehicle happens to be, these recommendations may arise after the driver has passed the location for safe maneuver to divert. Human factors research has been conducted to assess the safe distance before the junction for recommended diversion that should be allowed for safe diversion. This safe distance would depend on the driver characteristics, as well as on the vehicle and road characteristics (including the lane location). The guidance system should be designed so that only safe diversion advice will be given to the driver. Extension of research on anticipatory route guidance includes 1) the projection of link costs through traffic modeling and simulation, 2) inclusion of multiple transportation modes, and 3) coordination with traffic light controls. The research strategy is to generate practical guidelines for ATIS product development, which can be upgraded incrementally as additional research results become available, and as component costs change.","doi":"10.1109/VNIS.1991.205790","publicationTitle":"Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems Conference, 1991","displayPublicationTitle":"Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems Conference, 1991","pdfPath":"/iel5/10807/34086/01623654.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNIS.1991.205790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Research on anticipatory route guidance","volume":"2","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","publicationDate":"1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623654/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on anticipatory route guidance","confLoc":"Troy, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"01623654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053123S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 1991","isNumber":"34086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10807","citationCount":"81","articleId":"1623654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1623700,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Next, a possible integration framework which essentially acts to decouple RTI applications from communications networks is described. The aim is to facilitate end-to-end communications between any two application systems which need to communicate, regardless of the network to which each is attached.

In the NoC architecture, data is transferred from one Processing Element (PE) to another PE through the routers in the form of a packet. A router, suitable for both the binary and the multiple-valued packets, is constructed using the Multiple Valued Source-Coupled Logic circuits. A packet is composed of flag, destination PE address and data fields. In the NoC architecture, packets are generated by microprogram control. In the proposed scheme, two binary packets are multiplexed if the destination PE addresses are the same. Based on address matching, packets are transferred from a source PE to a destination PE autonomously. As a result, the total number of packets can be reduced. The router is designed using 0.18\u00ecm CMOS design rule. HSPICE simulation results show that the delay of the router is significantly small for high speed packet transfer. Reduction of microprogram control storage is remarkable in the proposed scheme, because the data transfer can be done autonomously. The advantage is evaluated by simple analysis, and comparison with a conventional pipelined bus architecture is done.","doi":"10.1109/ISMVL.2006.21","publicationTitle":"36th International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic (ISMVL'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"36th International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic (ISMVL'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10811/34090/01623958.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMVL.2006.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34090","startPage":"6","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Multiple-Valued Packet Multiplexing Scheme for Network-on-Chip Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1623958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Multiple-Valued Packet Multiplexing Scheme for Network-on-Chip Architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623958/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1623958/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Multiple-Valued Packet Multiplexing Scheme for Network-on-Chip Architecture","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01623958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043966S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10811","isNumber":"34090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10811","xplore-issue":"34090","articleId":"1623958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1623982,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

A vulnerability signature matches all exploits of a given vulnerability, even polymorphic or metamorphic variants. Our work departs from previous approaches by focusing on the semantics of the program and vulnerability exercised by a sample exploit instead of the semantics or syntax of the exploit itself. We show the semantics of a vulnerability define a language which contains all and only those inputs that exploit the vulnerability. A vulnerability signature is a representation (e.g., a regular expression) of the vulnerability language. Unlike exploit-based signatures whose error rate can only be empirically measured for known test cases, the quality of a vulnerability signature can be formally quantified for all possible inputs. We provide a formal definition of a vulnerability signature and investigate the computational complexity of creating and matching vulnerability signatures. We also systematically explore the design space of vulnerability signatures. We identify three central issues in vulnerability-signature creation: how a vulnerability signature represents the set of inputs that may exercise a vulnerability, the vulnerability coverage (i.e., number of vulnerable program paths) that is subject to our analysis during signature creation, and how a vulnerability signature is then created for a given representation and coverage. We propose new data-flow analysis and novel adoption of existing techniques such as constraint solving for automatically generating vulnerability signatures. We have built a prototype system to test our techniques. Our experiments show that we can automatically generate a vulnerability signature using a single exploit which is of much higher quality than previous exploit-based signatures. In addition, our techniques have several other security applications, and thus may be of independent interest","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2006.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34091","startPage":"15 pp.","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10812/34091/01623997.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards automatic generation of vulnerability-based signatures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1623997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1623997/","displayDocTitle":"Towards automatic generation of vulnerability-based signatures","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9055113","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards automatic generation of vulnerability-based signatures","confLoc":"Berkeley/Oakland, CA","sourcePdf":"01623997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133084S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10812","isNumber":"34091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10812","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"34091","articleId":"1623997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":1624000,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","doi":"10.1109/SP.2006.12","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10812/34091/01624000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2006.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34091","startPage":"15 pp.","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dataflow anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dataflow anomaly detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624000/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9055116","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624000/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dataflow anomaly detection","confLoc":"Berkeley/Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01624000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135019S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10812","isNumber":"34091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10812","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"34091","articleId":"1624000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1624007,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Firewalls provide important defense for network security. However, misconfigurations in firewalls are very common and significantly weaken the desired security. This paper introduces FIREMAN, a static analysis toolkit for firewall modeling and analysis. By treating firewall configurations as specialized programs, FIREMAN applies static analysis techniques to check misconfigurations, such as policy violations, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies, in individual firewalls as well as among distributed firewalls. FIREMAN performs symbolic model checking of the firewall configurations for all possible IP packets and along all possible data paths. It is both sound and complete because of the finite state nature of firewall configurations. FIREMAN is implemented by modeling firewall rules using binary decision diagrams (BDDs), which have been used successfully in hardware verification and model checking. We have experimented with FIREMAN and used it to uncover several real misconfigurations in enterprise networks, some of which have been subsequently confirmed and corrected by the administrators of these networks","doi":"10.1109/SP.2006.16","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10812/34091/01624012.pdf","startPage":"15 pp.","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2006.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FIREMAN: a toolkit for firewall modeling and analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624012/","displayDocTitle":"FIREMAN: a toolkit for firewall modeling and analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9055128","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1624012/","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FIREMAN: a toolkit for firewall modeling and analysis","confLoc":"Berkeley/Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01624012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066604S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10812","isNumber":"34091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10812","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"34091","articleId":"1624012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624017,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Current research in fine-grained code analysis can be categorized into static and dynamic approaches. Static approaches have been tailored towards malware and allow exhaustive fine-grained malicious code analysis, but lack support for self-modifying code, have limitations related to code-obfuscations and face the undecidability problem. Given that most if not all malware employ self-modifying code and code-obfuscations, poses the need to analyze them at runtime using dynamic approaches. However, current dynamic approaches for fine-grained code analysis are not tailored specifically towards malware and lack support for multithreading, self-modifying/self-checking code and are easily detected and countered by ever-evolving anti-analysis tricks employed by malware. To address this problem, we propose a powerful dynamic fine-grained malicious code analysis framework, codenamed Cobra, to combat malware that are becoming increasingly hard to analyze. Our goal is to provide a stealth, efficient, portable and easy-to-use framework supporting multithreading, self-modifying/self-checking code and any form of code obfuscation in both user- and kernel-mode on commodity operating systems. Cobra cannot be detected or countered and can be dynamically and selectively deployed on malware specific code-streams while allowing other code-streams to execute as is.

Exact analytical expressions are derived for the symbol error probability (SEP) for BPSK and QPSK modulation schemes. The analysis presented has the following key features - it explicitly accounts for (i) the non-Gaussian nature of the intercarrier-interference (ICI) noise when the total number of subcarriers is small, and (ii) the dependency of the post-FFT signal and the ICI noise terms due to subcarrier correlations. Thus, the proposed method provides accurate SEP formulae, overcoming the inaccuracies involved in Gaussian approximation based methods reported in literature. The numerical results demonstrate the sensitivity of the receiver error performance to CFO in SISO-OFDM and ST-coded OFDM systems in flat Rayleigh fading channels.

The proposed algorithm comprises of two steps, first a coarse CFO estimator such as the one presented in M. Li and W. Zhang (2003) is employed to estimate the integer component of the CFO.

Code acquisition under severe multiple access interference conditions with time varying codes makes the task even more difficult. Inefficient designs lead to large number of false alarms and/or missed detections. This paper details a realistic powerful code acquisition technique for the uplink of direct-sequence code-division multiple-access systems under high loaded situations, where the number of users is greater than the processing gain. Under this high multiple access interference condition the DS-CDMA acquisition problem becomes very difficult and conventional search methods simply fail. The method discussed utilises soft data from a multiuser detector to reduce the interference received by the acquisition unit.

The thermal noise behavior in the multi-antenna system is determined by applying the Nyquist's thermal noise theorem. The partial correlation of thermal noise for antenna spacing lower then a wavelength is confirmed. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the closely spaced antennae in the multi-antenna system is then estimated, using presented method for thermal noise analysis.

A particularly difficult part of these systems is the detector, where the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution cannot be directly implemented due to its exponential complexity. Lattice decoders, such as the sphere search, exhibit near-ML performance with reduced complexity, but their application is still limited by computational requirements. Here, a number of optimisations are presented, designed to reduce the computational cost of the sphere search in the context of VLSI implementation for MIMO applications. We also propose parallel implementation strategies for such a detector, suitable for implementation in VLSI.

Nano- and micro-filler mixture composites were made by dispersing nano-scale layered silicate fillers and micro-scale silica fillers in epoxy resin. To investigate the effects of nano- and micro-filler mixture, the thermal expansion coefficient and insulation breakdown properties by a needle-plate electrode method were measured for the filler mixture composite and the conventional filled epoxy. The filler mixture composite had almost the same thermal expansion coefficient as the conventional filled epoxy. In a continuous voltage rising test, the filler mixture composite had 7% higher insulation breakdown strength than the conventional filled epoxy. Moreover, under constant AC voltage (10 kV at 1 kHz), the filler mixture composite had an insulation breakdown time of more than 20,000 minutes whereas the conventional filled epoxy had a breakdown time of 830 minutes. Electron microscope observation showed that the area surrounded by dispersed micro-scale silica fillers were also filled with the nano-scale layered silicate fillers. Furthermore, the estimate of spacing between the fillers and the filler/epoxy interface area showed a more densely-packed structure of the filler mixture composite than the conventional filled epoxy. The morphological feature of the filler mixture composite seems to improve its insulation breakdown strength and time.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2006.1624276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/34095/01624276.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2006.1624276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34095","startPage":"319","endPage":"326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of nano- and micro-filler mixture on electrical insulation properties of epoxy based composites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of nano- and micro-filler mixture on electrical insulation properties of epoxy based composites","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8971013","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624276/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of nano- and micro-filler mixture on electrical insulation properties of epoxy based composites","sourcePdf":"01624276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068745S","chronDate":"April  2006","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"34095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"34095","articleId":"1624276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1624291,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This nanocomposite has a higher thermal resistance with respect to mechanical properties than a base epoxy resin (epoxy resin without fillers). The volume resistivity of the nanocomposite gradually decreases with increasing temperature, and its relative permittivity gradually increases with increasing temperature. Its properties are more dependent on temperature than those of the base epoxy resin. Moreover, under a constant AC voltage, the insulation breakdown time of the nanocomposite was twice as long as that of the base epoxy resin at 20 /spl deg/C and six times as long at 80 /spl deg/C. In particular, at 145 /spl deg/C, the nanocomposite had a breakdown time of more than 20,000 minutes while the base epoxy resin had breakdown time of 280 minutes. This improvement in breakdown time resulted from electrical treeing shapes with many branches and smaller internal stress of the nanocomposite in comparison with the base epoxy resin.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2006.1624291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/34095/01624291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2006.1624291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34095","startPage":"445","endPage":"452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of temperature on mechanical and insulation properties of epoxy-layered silicate nanocomposite","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of temperature on mechanical and insulation properties of epoxy-layered silicate nanocomposite","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8971028","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624291/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of temperature on mechanical and insulation properties of epoxy-layered silicate nanocomposite","sourcePdf":"01624291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059977S","chronDate":"April  2006","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"34095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"34095","articleId":"1624291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1624302,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Although the medium access control signaling has been well-defined in the IEEE 802.16 specifications, resource management and scheduling, which are crucial components to guarantee quality of service performances, still remain as open issues. In this paper, we propose adaptive queue-aware uplink bandwidth allocation and rate control mechanisms in a subscriber station for polling service in IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless networks. While the bandwidth allocation mechanism adaptively allocates bandwidth for polling service in the presence of higher priority unsolicited grant service, the rate control mechanism dynamically limits the transmission rate for the connections under polling service. Both of these schemes exploit the queue status information to guarantee the desired quality of service (QoS) performance for polling service. We present a queuing analytical framework to analyze the proposed resource management model from which various performance measures for polling service in both steady and transient states can be obtained. We also analyze the performance of best-effort service in the presence of unsolicited grant service and polling service. The proposed analytical model would be useful for performance evaluation and engineering of radio resource management alternatives in a subscriber station so that the desired quality of service performances for polling service can be achieved. Analytical results are validated by simulations and typical numerical results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8985554","htmlLink":"/document/1624339/","displayDocTitle":"Queue-aware uplink bandwidth allocation and rate control for polling service in IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queue-aware uplink bandwidth allocation and rate control for polling service in IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless networks","sourcePdf":"01624339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15023S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"34098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"34098","articleId":"1624339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1624340,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Cooperative communication is a novel model introduced recently that allows combining partial messages to decode a complete message. The objective of the TCC problem is to obtain a strongly-connected topology with minimum total energy consumption. We show that the TCC problem is NIP-complete and design two distributed and localized algorithms to be used by the nodes to set up their communication ranges. Both algorithms can be applied on top of any symmetric, strongly-connected topology to reduce total power consumption. The first algorithm uses a distributed decision process at each node that makes use of only 2-hop neighborhood information. The second algorithm sets up the transmission ranges of nodes iteratively, over a maximum of six steps, using only 1-hop neighborhood information. We analyze the performance of our approaches through extensive simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.87","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"711","endPage":"724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34098","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/34098/01624342.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Communication system control","Intelligent networks","Wireless networks","Peer to peer computing","Iterative algorithms","Energy consumption","Protocols","Decoding","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network topology","ad hoc networks","computational complexity","power consumption","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topology control","ad hoc wireless networks","cooperative communication","NP-complete problem","total power consumption","distributed decision process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc wireless networks","cooperative communication","energy efficiency","topology control."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Topology control in ad hoc wireless networks using cooperative communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624342/","volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1624342/","accessionNumber":"8985557","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology control in ad hoc wireless networks using cooperative communication","sourcePdf":"01624342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077327S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"34098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"34098","articleId":"1624342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1624344,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The QoS provisioning is performed in two quality domains, namely, timeliness and reliability. Multiple QoS levels are provided in the timeliness domain by guaranteeing multiple packet delivery speed options. In the reliability domain, various reliability requirements are supported by probabilistic multipath forwarding. These mechanisms for QoS provisioning are realized in a localized way without global network information by employing localized geographic packet forwarding augmented with dynamic compensation, which compensates for local decision inaccuracies as a packet travels towards its destination. This way, MMSPEED can guarantee end-to-end requirements in a localized way, which is desirable for scalability and adaptability to large scale dynamic sensor networks. Simulation results show that MMSPEED provides QoS differentiation in both reliability and timeliness domains and, as a result, significantly improves the effective capacity of a sensor network in terms of number of flows that meet both reliability and timeliness requirements up to 50 percent (12 flows versus 18 flows).","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/34098/01624344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34098","startPage":"738","endPage":"754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSPEED: multipath Multi-SPEED protocol for QoS guarantee of reliability and.

Since video data consume the largest part of the available bitrate compared to other media, optimization of video streaming for this new standard is a significant factor for the successful deployment of practical systems. Delay-constrained streaming of fully-scalable video over IEEE 802.11 a/e WLANs is of great interest for many multimedia applications. The new medium access control (MAC) protocol of IEEE 802.11e is called the Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) and, in this paper, we will specifically consider the problem of video transmission over HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA). A cross-layer optimization across the MAC and application layers of the OSI stack is used in order to exploit the features provided by the combination of the new HCCA standard with new versatile scalable video coding algorithms. Specifically, we propose an optimized and scalable HCCA-based admission control for delay-constrained video streaming applications that leads to a larger number of stations being simultaneously admitted (without quality reduction to any video flow). Subsequently, given the allocated transmission opportunity, each station deploys an optimized Application-MAC-PHY adaptation, scheduling, and protection strategy that is facilitated by the fine-grain layering provided by the scalable bitstream. Given that each video flow needs to always comply with the predetermined (a priori negotiated) traffic specification parameters, this cross-layer strategy enables graceful quality degradation whenever the channel conditions or the video sequence characteristics change. For instance, it is demonstrated that the proposed cross-layer protection and bitstream adaptation strategies facilitate QoS token rate adaptation under link adaptation mechanisms that utilize different physical layer transmission rates. The expected gains offered by the optimized solutions proposed in this paper are established theoretically, as well as through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.81","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/34098/01624345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34098","startPage":"755","endPage":"768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized scalable video streaming over IEEE 802.11 a/e HCCA wireless networks under delay constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized scalable video streaming over IEEE 802.11 a/e HCCA wireless networks under delay constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8985560","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624345/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized scalable video streaming over IEEE 802.11 a/e HCCA wireless networks under delay constraints","sourcePdf":"01624345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094931S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"34098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"34098","articleId":"1624345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1624352,"authors":[{"name":"Zongyi Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Zongyi Liu","id":"37087581557"},{"name":"S.

We show that improved gait recognition can be achieved after normalization of dynamics and focusing on the shape information. We normalize for gait dynamics using a generic walking model, as captured by a population hidden Markov model (pHMM) defined for a set of individuals. The states of this pHMM represent gait stances over one gait cycle and the observations are the silhouettes of the corresponding gait stances. For each sequence, we first use Viterbi decoding of the gait dynamics to arrive at one dynamics-normalized, averaged, gait cycle of fixed length. The distance between two sequences is the distance between the two corresponding dynamics-normalized gait cycles, which we quantify by the sum of the distances between the corresponding gait stances. Distances between two silhouettes from the same generic gait stance are computed in the linear discriminant analysis space so as to maximize the discrimination between persons, while minimizing the variations of the same subject under different conditions. The distance computation is constructed so that it is invariant to dilations and erosions of the silhouettes. This helps us handle variations in silhouette shape that can occur with changing imaging conditions. We present results on three different, publicly available, data sets. First, we consider the HumanID gait challenge data set, which is the largest gait benchmarking data set that is available (122 subjects), exercising five different factors, i.e., viewpoint, shoe, surface, carrying condition, and time. We significantly improve the performance across the hard experiments involving surface change and briefcase carrying conditions. Second, we also show improved performance on the UMD gait data set that exercises time variations for 55 subjects. Third, on the CMU Mobo data set, we show results for matching across different walking speeds. It is worth noting that there was no separate training for the UMD and CMU data sets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/34099/01624352.pdf","startPage":"863","endPage":"876","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved gait recognition by gait dynamics normalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","displayDocTitle":"Improved gait recognition by gait dynamics normalization","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1624352/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982673","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","pubMedId":"16724582","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved gait recognition by gait dynamics normalization","sourcePdf":"01624352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055576S","chronDate":"June  2006","isNumber":"34099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"234","articleId":"1624352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1624353,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

However, when clusters touch each other, both the cluster centers and cluster boundaries (as the peaks and valleys of the density distribution) become fuzzy and difficult to determine. We introduce the notion of cluster intensity function (CIF) which captures the important characteristics of clusters. When clusters are well-separated, CIFs are similar to density functions. But, when clusters become closed to each other, CIFs still clearly reveal cluster centers, cluster boundaries, and degree of membership of each data point to the cluster that it belongs. Clustering through bump hunting and valley seeking based on these functions are more robust than that based on density functions obtained by kernel density estimation, which are often oscillatory or oversmoothed. These problems of kernel density estimation are resolved using level set methods and related techniques. Comparisons with two existing density-based methods, valley seeking and DBSCAN, are presented which illustrate the advantages of our approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic cluster formation using level set methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.117","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/34099/01624353.pdf","startPage":"877","endPage":"889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic cluster formation using level set methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1624353/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982674","pubMedId":"16724583","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic cluster formation using level set methods","sourcePdf":"01624353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069815S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"34099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"34099","articleId":"1624353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1624355,"authors":[{"name":"Mun Wai Lee","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/34099/1624355/1624355-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mun Wai Lee received the BEng and the MEng degrees in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore in 1998 and 1999, respectively.

This problem is challenging due to the presence of clutter in the image, ambiguities in image observation, unknown human image boundary, and high-dimensional state space due to the complex articulated structure of the human body. Human pose estimation can be made more robust by integrating the detection of body components such as face and limbs, with the highly constrained structure of the articulated body. In this paper, a data-driven approach based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (DD-MCMC) is used, where component detection results generate state proposals for 3D pose estimation. To translate these observations into pose hypotheses, we introduce the use of \"proposal maps,\" an efficient way of consolidating the evidence and generating 3D pose candidates during the MCMC search. Experimental results on a set of test images show that the method is able to estimate the human pose in static images of real scenes.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.110","startPage":"905","endPage":"916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34099","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/34099/01624355.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model-based approach for estimating human 3D poses in static images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624355/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A model-based approach for estimating human 3D poses in static images","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1624355/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8982676","pubMedId":"16724585","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model-based approach for estimating human 3D poses in static images","sourcePdf":"01624355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111739S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"34099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"34099","articleId":"1624355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1624356,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Assuming normality in the RKHS, we derive analytic expressions for probabilistic distance measures that are commonly used in many applications, such as Chernoff distance (or the Bhattacharyya distance as its special case), Kullback-Leibler divergence, etc. Since the reproducing kernel implicitly embeds a nonlinear mapping, our approach presents a new way to study these distances whose feasibility and efficiency is demonstrated using experiments with synthetic and real examples. Further, we extend the ensemble similarity to the reproducing kernel for ensemble and study the ensemble similarity for more general data representations.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.120","startPage":"917","endPage":"929","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/34099/01624356.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From sample similarity to ensemble similarity: probabilistic distance measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","displayDocTitle":"From sample similarity to ensemble similarity: probabilistic distance measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert space","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1624356/","accessionNumber":"8982677","pubMedId":"16724586","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624356/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From sample similarity to ensemble similarity: probabilistic distance measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert space","sourcePdf":"01624356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118887S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"34099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"34099","articleId":"1624356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1624358,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["LITA, Universit\u00e9 de Metz, Metz, France","School of Computing and Mathematics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Ulster, Metz, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/34099/1624358/1624358-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Wang received the BSc degree in computer science from Jilin University of China in 1985 and then went on a three-year MSc program in artificial intelligence.

This idea is explicitly used in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN), a popular classification method. In this paper, this idea is adopted in the development of a general methodology, neighborhood counting, for devising similarity functions. We turn our focus from neighbors to neighborhoods, a region in the data space covering the data point in question. To measure the similarity between two data points, we consider all neighborhoods that cover both data points. We propose to use the number of such neighborhoods as a measure of similarity. Neighborhood can be defined for different types of data in different ways. Here, we consider one definition of neighborhood for multivariate data and derive a formula for such similarity, called neighborhood counting measure or NCM. NCM was tested experimentally in the framework of kNN. Experiments show that NCM is generally comparable to VDM and its variants, the state-of-the-art distance functions for multivariate data, and, at the same time, is consistently better for relatively large k values. Additionally, NCM consistently outperforms HEOM (a mixture of Euclidean and Hamming distances), the \"standard\" and most widely used distance function for multivariate data. NCM has a computational complexity in the same order as the standard Euclidean distance function and NCM is task independent and works for numerical and categorical data in a conceptually uniform way. The neighborhood counting methodology is proven sound for multivariate data experimentally. We hope it works for other types of data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624358/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8982679","pubMedId":"16724588","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624358/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nearest neighbors by neighborhood counting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nearest neighbors by neighborhood counting","sourcePdf":"01624358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094229S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"34099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"34099","articleId":"1624358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1624362,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Two major techniques are used sequentially in a real-time fashion in order to obtain the most efficient and independent components that describe a whole set of human faces database.

Our method is validated using the UCI database and applied to a real problem, the classification of traffic sign images.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/34099/01624364.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34099","startPage":"1007","endPage":"1012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminant ECOC: a heuristic method for application dependent design of error correcting output codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discriminant ECOC: a heuristic method for application dependent design of error correcting output codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982685","pubMedId":"16724594","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624364/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminant ECOC: a heuristic method for application dependent design of error correcting output codes","sourcePdf":"01624364.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036384S","chronDate":"June  2006","isNumber":"34099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"174","articleId":"1624364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624374,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Manual traversal of the vast communication design space to synthesize a communication architecture that meets performance requirements becomes infeasible. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an automated approach for floorplan-aware bus architecture synthesis (FABSYN) to synthesize cost-effective, bus-based communication architectures that satisfy the performance constraints in a design. Our synthesis approach incorporates a high-level floorplanning and wire delay estimation engine to evaluate the feasibility of the synthesized bus architecture and detect bus cycle time violations early in the design How, at the system level. We present case studies of network communication SoC subsystems for which we synthesized bus architectures, detected and eliminated timing violations, and generated core placements in a matter of hours instead of several days for a manual effort.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2006.871763","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/34100/01624374.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2006.871763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34100","startPage":"241","endPage":"253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FABSYN: floorplan-aware bus architecture synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FABSYN: floorplan-aware bus architecture synthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8892484","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624374/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FABSYN: floorplan-aware bus architecture synthesis","sourcePdf":"01624374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070086S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"34100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"34100","articleId":"1624374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1624377,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This is even more true as the gap between processor and memory speed continues to grow. Hardware and software prefetching have been shown to be effective in tolerating the large memory latencies inherit in large off-chip memories; however, both types of prefetching have their shortcomings. Hardware schemes are more complex and require extra circuitry to compute data access strides, while software schemes generate prefetch instructions, which if not computed carefully may hamper performance. On the other hand, some applications domains (such as multimedia) have a uniform and known a priori memory access pattern, that if exploited, could yield significant application performance improvement. With this characteristic in mind, we present our findings on hiding memory latency using the direct memory access (DMA) mode, which is present in all modern systems, combined with a software prefetch mechanism, and a customized on-chip memory hierarchy mapping. Compared to previous approaches, we are able to estimate the performance and power metrics, without actually implementing the embedded system. Experimental results on nine well known multimedia and imaging applications prove the efficiency of our technique. Finally, we verify the performance estimations by implementing and simulating the algorithms on the TI C6201 processor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combined DMA and application-specific prefetching approach for tackling the memory latency bottleneck","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2006.871759","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/34100/01624377.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2006.871759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","displayDocTitle":"A combined DMA and application-specific prefetching approach for tackling the memory latency bottleneck","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1624377/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8892487","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combined DMA and application-specific prefetching approach for tackling the memory latency bottleneck","sourcePdf":"01624377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088529S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"34100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"34100","articleId":"1624377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624389,"authors":[{"name":"Jri Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/34101/1624389/1624389-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jri Lee (M'03) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1995 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), both in 2003.","From 1997 to 1998, he was with Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, investigating control systems for novel solid-state lasers.

In this paper we present an experimental environment to characterize the sensitivity of embedded analog circuits to digitally generated substrate noise. Our measurement technique is based on equivalent-time substrate voltage sampling and uses a simple differential latch comparator without explicit input sample-and-hold. A surprisingly large measurement bandwidth is observed,which is explained from the detailed circuit behavior. On our 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS test chip,we have demonstrated that our system allows to wave trace pulses as narrow as 200 ps accurately. Additionally, the extraction of precise measurement data from observations that are excessively corrupted by additive noise and timing jitter is addressed. We present simple yet very effective methods to accurately reconstruct pulse waveform features without the use of delicate deconvolution operations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.872873","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/34101/01624395.pdf","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1072","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.872873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple on-chip repetitive sampling setup for the quantification of substrate noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"A simple on-chip repetitive sampling setup for the quantification of substrate noise","volume":"41","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624395/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888536","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple on-chip repetitive sampling setup for the quantification of substrate noise","sourcePdf":"01624395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082572S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"34101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34101","articleId":"1624395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1624396,"authors":[{"name":"Jongchan Kang","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/34101/1624396/1624396-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jongchan Kang received the B.S. degree in the electronic engineering from Hanyang University in 2000 and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2002.

The transceiver has been designed to meet all narrowband blocker, newly proposed Adjacent Channel II, and Category 10 HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) requirements. The design is part of a reconfigurable reference platform for multi-band, multi-mode (GSM/EDGE + WCDMA) radios. The zero-IF receiver is comprised of a novel multi-band quadrature mixer, seventh-order baseband filtering, and a novel DC offset correction scheme, which exhibits no settling time or peak switching transients after gain steps. The receiver lineup is designed to optimize HSDPA throughput and minimize sensitivity to analog baseband filter bandwidth variations. The direct-launch transmitter is made up of a third-order baseband filter, an I/Q modulator with variable gain, an integrated transformer, an RF variable gain amplifier, and a power amplifier driver. At +9.5-dBm output power, the transmitter achieves an error vector magnitude (EVM) of 4%. Fractional-N synthesizers achieve fast lock times of 50 /spl mu/s (150 /spl mu/s) within 20 ppm (0.1 ppm). Automatically calibrated, integrated VCOs achieve a 1.6-GHz tuning range to facilitate coverage over all six 3GPP frequency bands. The IC draws 34 mA in receive (18-mA receiver plus 16-mA fractional-N PLL/VCO) and 50 to 62 mA in transmit (-76 dBm to +9.5 dBm), including PLL/VCO, using a 2.775-V supply voltage. The RF transceiver is integrated with the baseband signal processing and associated passives in a 165-pad package, resulting in the first tri-band 3G radio transceiver with a digital interface which requires no external components.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.872743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/34101/01624402.pdf","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.872743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A single-chip tri-band (2100, 1900, 850/800 MHz) WCDMA/HSDPA cellular transceiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"A single-chip tri-band (2100, 1900, 850/800 MHz) WCDMA/HSDPA cellular transceiver","volume":"41","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8888542","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1624402/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624402/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A single-chip tri-band (2100, 1900, 850/800 MHz) WCDMA/HSDPA cellular transceiver","sourcePdf":"01624402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118984S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"34101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"34101","articleId":"1624402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1624404,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A high-efficiency RF-DC converter generates a 3-VDC supply for the system from a -12.3-dBm incident RF signal, gathered by a commercial 50-/spl Omega/ antenna. A system clock is extracted from the same incident signal, by an injection-locked LC oscillator. Sub-harmonic injection-locking facilitates the separation of the incident and the transmit signal frequencies, without need for a PLL.

The DCO is part of a single-chip fully compliant quad-band GSM transceiver realized in a 90-nm digital CMOS process. By operating the DCO at a 4 /spl times/ GSM low-band frequency followed by frequency dividers, the requirement of on-chip inductor Q and the amount of gate oxide stress are relaxed. It was found that a dynamic divider is needed for stringent TX output phase noise while a source-coupled-logic divider can be used for RX to save power. Both dividers are capable of producing a tight relation between four quadrature output phases at low voltage and low power. Frequency tuning is achieved through digital control of the varactors which serve as an RF DAC. Combining a MIM capacitor array and two nMOS transistor arrays of the varactors for the RF DAC, a highly linear oscillator gain which is also insensitive to process shift is achieved. The finest varactor step size is 12 kHz at the 1.6-2.0 GHz output. With a sigma-delta dithering, high frequency resolution is obtained while having negligible phase noise degradation. The measured phase noise of -167 dBc/Hz at 20 MHz offset from 915 MHz carrier and frequency tuning range of 24.5% proves that this DCO system can be used in SAW-less quad-band transmitters for mobile phones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digitally controlled oscillator system for SAW-less transmitters in cellular handsets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.872739","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/34101/01624406.pdf","startPage":"1160","endPage":"1170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.872739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"A digitally controlled oscillator system for SAW-less transmitters in cellular handsets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624406/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888546","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digitally controlled oscillator system for SAW-less transmitters in cellular handsets","sourcePdf":"01624406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120495S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"34101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"34101","articleId":"1624406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624407,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The filter works by injecting a matched out-of-phase copy of the TX leakage into the LNA output. It requires a reference signal coupled from the TX chain, whose I and Q components are appropriately scaled to generate the matched copy. The scale factors are the results of the correlation between the filter output signal and the I/Q components of the reference signal. The filter was designed as part of a 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS cellular-band receiver. The effect of the DC offsets in the correlators on the TX leakage rejection ratio (TXRR) was minimized by using the sign-data variant of the LMS algorithm and by increasing the gain of the correlating multipliers. The loop stability margin was improved by swapping the I and Q reference inputs of the scaling multipliers. Without a significant group delay of the TX leakage relative to the reference signal, the filter achieved the maximum TXRR of 28 dB, which was limited by the reference signal coupling. The group delay introduced by the SAW duplexer reduced the minimum TXRR to 10.8 dB. The filter degraded the LNA noise factor and gain by 1.3 dB and 1.7 dB, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Adaptive filters","Multiaccess communication","Delay","Matched filters","Signal generators","Correlators","Stability","Surface acoustic waves","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","continuous time filters","radio receivers","multiplexing equipment","least mean squares methods","code division multiple access","low noise amplifiers","leakage currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated LMS adaptive filter","CDMA receiver front end","continuous-time LMS adaptive filter","LNA output","reference signals","DC offsets","TX leakage rejection ratio","sign-data variant","LMS algorithm","loop stability margin","scaling multipliers","group delay","SAW duplexer","1.3 dB","1.7 dB","0.25 micron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filters","analog multipliers","circuit stability","continuous time filters","correlators","cross modulation distortion","delay effects","filter noise","intermodulation distortion","least mean square methods","notch filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624407","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.872738","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/34101/01624407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.872738","startPage":"1171","endPage":"1182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated LMS adaptive filter of TX leakage for CDMA receiver front ends","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An integrated LMS adaptive filter of TX leakage for CDMA receiver front ends","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624407/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","volume":"41","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624407/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888547","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated LMS adaptive filter of TX leakage for CDMA receiver front ends","sourcePdf":"01624407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117543S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"34101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"34101","articleId":"1624407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1624408,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.D.

Experimental measurements demonstrate Q-factor ranging from 25 to 35 between 15 and 40 GHz for shielded coplanar waveguide fabricated on 10 /spl Omega//spl middot/cm silicon. This is more than a factor of 2 improvement over conventional on-chip transmission lines (e.g., microstrip, CPW).

Floating-shielded bond-pads with 15% less parasitic capacitance and over 60% higher shunt equivalent resistance compared to conventional shielded bondpads are also described.

Device stacking is a viable way to reduce voltage drops across a single device, improving long-term reliability. In this paper, we focus on cascode-based topologies, analyzing the loss mechanisms and giving direction to optimize the design. In particular, a new dissipative mechanism, peculiar of the cascode implementation, is identified and a circuit solution to minimize its effect is proposed. Prototypes, realized in a 0.13-/spl mu/m CMOS technology demonstrate 67% PAE while delivering 23 dBm peak power at 1.7 GHz. Good bandwidth was also realized with greater than 60% PAE over the frequency range of 1.4-2 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.872734","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/34101/01624411.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.872734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"1222","endPage":"1229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of reliability and power efficiency in cascode class-E PAs","volume":"41","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624411/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8888551","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of reliability and power efficiency in cascode class-E PAs","sourcePdf":"01624411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079703S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"34101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"34101","articleId":"1624411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624419,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The nonlinear feedback is provided by the stabilizing fields of the laser amplifiers, interfering with coherent optical reference fields. In both stable states of the flip-flop, the nonlinear feedback allows the laser amplifiers to maintain an ever present photon population in the laser modes and to have an approximately constant carrier population. This enables faster response (switching times below 25 ps are reached in this work)than in conventional active optical flip-flop structures. The operation of the flip-flop is studied using a rate equation model accounting for the carrier densities and the complex electric fields in the different cavity modes of the laser amplifiers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flip-flops","Laser feedback","Optical feedback","Laser modes","Optical amplifiers","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Laser stability","Nonlinear optical devices","Semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-flops","optical storage","light coherence","optical feedback","laser modes","carrier density","laser cavity resonators","optical bistability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-optical flip-flop memory","electric field nonlinearity","coherent laser amplifiers","coherent nonlinear feedback","field stability","laser modes","photon population","carrier population","rate equation model","cavity modes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Laser amplifiers","optical bistability","optical memory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.2006.874004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/33916/01624419.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2006.874004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast all-optical flip-flop memory exploiting the electric field nonlinearity of coherent laser amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast all-optical flip-flop memory exploiting the electric field nonlinearity of coherent laser amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624419/","volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1624419/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8888678","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast all-optical flip-flop memory exploiting the electric field nonlinearity of coherent laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01624419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056107S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"33916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33916","articleId":"1624419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1624447,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

Traditionally, the high dielectric constant and the thick LTCC substrate seriously degrade the gain and radiation property performance because a large portion of the radiated fields are confined in the LTCC substrate. However, the proposed LTSA with the air cavity backing structure exhibits a high gain (4.9-6.9 dBi) and a good end fire radiation pattern. Also, the proposed antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth (about 30 from 45 to 75 GHz).

Optimizing these parameters via standard engine mapping and calibration has become a very time consuming task. The specific problem under consideration in this paper is optimization of intake, exhaust, and spark timings to improve the brake specific fuel consumption of a dual-independent variable cam timing engine. We have explored extremum seeking (ES) as a method to find the optimal setting of the parameters. During ES, the engine is running at fixed speed and torque in a dynamometer test cell, while an optimization algorithm is iteratively adjusting the three parameters. For our purposes, we have modified several algorithms available in the literature. The details about the algorithms and the experimental results they produced are presented and discussed in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2005.863660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","startPage":"398","endPage":"407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/34103/01624464.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2005.863660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extremum seeking methods for optimization of variable cam timing engine operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Timing","Engines","Iterative algorithms","Automotive engineering","Calibration","Sparks","Fuels","Torque","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","timing","cams (mechanical)","engines","brakes","calibration","automobiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extremum seeking methods","optimization","variable cam timing engine operation","automotive engines","engine mapping","engine calibration","spark timing","brake specific fuel consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extremum seeking (ES)","gradient search","variable valve timing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Extremum seeking methods for optimization of variable cam timing engine operation","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8892462","publicationDate":"May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624464/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624464/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extremum seeking methods for optimization of variable cam timing engine operation","sourcePdf":"01624464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082549S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"34103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"34103","articleId":"1624464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624465,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Ho Shin","affiliation":["Kia Motors Corporation, Hyundai Motor Company, Gyeonggi, South Korea","Department of AeroSpace Engineering, The Institute of Advanced AeroSpace Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/34103/1624465/1624465-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong-Ho Shin was born in Seoul, Korea, on December 5, 1971.

The adaptive discrete-time nonlinear controller is developed using the backstepping technique and feedback linearization. Feedforward multilayer neural networks (NNs) are augmented to guarantee consistent performance when the effectiveness of the control decreases due to control surface damage. NNs learn through the recursive weight update rules that are derived from the discrete-time version of Lyapunov control theory. The boundness property of the error states and NN weight estimation errors is also investigated by the discrete-time Lyapunov analysis.

The system uncertainty, which includes mobile robot parameter variation and unknown nonlinearities, is estimated by a fuzzy logic system (FLS). The proposed adaptive controller structure represents an amalgamation of nonlinear processing elements and the theory of function approximation using FLS. The real-time control of mobile robots is achieved through the online tuning of FLS parameters. The system stability and the convergence of tracking errors are proved using the Lyapunov stability theory. Computer simulations are presented which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed tracking control law.

Path delay testing of FPGAs is especially important since path delay faults can render an otherwise fault-free FPGA unusable for a given design layout. This paper presents a new approach for FPGA path delay testing, which partitions target paths into subsets that are tested in the same test configuration. Each path is tested for all combinations of signal inversions along the path length. Each configuration consists of a sequence generator, response analyzer, and circuitry for controlling inversions along tested paths, all of which are formed from FPGA resources not currently under test. Two algorithms are presented for target-path partitioning to determine the number of required test configurations. The test circuitry associated with these methods is also described. The results of applying the methods indicate that our path-delay-testing approach requires seconds per design to cover all paths with delay within 10% of the critical path delay. The approach has been validated using Xilinx Virtex devices.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.855955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.855955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/34104/01624519.pdf","startPage":"867","endPage":"877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design-specific path delay testing in lookup-table-based FPGAs","volume":"25","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8886314","htmlLink":"/document/1624519/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design-specific path delay testing in lookup-table-based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"01624519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103518S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"34104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"34104","articleId":"1624519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624521,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, an analytical framework to model crosstalk noise in coupled RLC interconnects is presented. The proposed model is based on transmission-line theory and captures high-frequency effects in on-chip interconnects. The new model is generic in nature and can be applied to asymmetric driver-and-line configurations for aggressor and victim wires. The model is compared against SPICE simulations and is shown to capture both the waveform shape and peak noise accurately. Over a large set of random test cases, the average error in noise-peak estimation is approximately 6.5%. A key feature of the new model is that its derivation and form enables physical insight into the total coupling-noise-waveform shape and its dependence on relevant physical-design parameters. Due to its simplicity and physical nature, the proposed model can be applied to investigate the impact of various physical-design optimizations (e.g., wire sizing and spacing, shield insertion) on total RLC coupled noise. The effectiveness of various existing noise-reduction techniques in the presence of mutual-inductance coupling is studied here. The obtained results indicate that common (capacitive) noise-avoidance techniques can behave quite differently when both capacitive and inductive coupling are considered together.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.855961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/34104/01624521.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.855961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34104","startPage":"892","endPage":"901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and analysis of crosstalk noise in coupled RLC interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and analysis of crosstalk noise in coupled RLC interconnects","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8886316","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624521/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and analysis of crosstalk noise in coupled RLC interconnects","sourcePdf":"01624521.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099691S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"34104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"34104","articleId":"1624521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":1624547,"authors":[{"name":"V.

By sensing and adapting to its environment, such a device is able to fill voids in the wireless spectrum and can dramatically increase spectral efficiency. In this paper, the cognitive radio channel is defined as a two-sender, two-receiver interference channel in which sender 2 obtains the encoded message sender 1 plans to transmit. We consider two cases: in the genie-aided cognitive radio channel, sender 2 is noncausally presented the data to be transmitted by sender 1 while in the causal cognitive radio channel, the data is obtained causally. The cognitive radio at sender 2 may then choose to transmit simultaneously over the same channel, as opposed to waiting for an idle channel as is traditional for a cognitive radio. Our main result is the development of an achievable region which combines Gel'fand-Pinkser coding with an achievable region construction for the interference channel. In the additive Gaussian noise case, this resembles dirty-paper coding, a technique used in the computation of the capacity of the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. Numerical evaluation of the region in the Gaussian noise case is performed, and compared to an inner bound, the interference channel, and an outer bound, a modified Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. Results are also extended to the case in which the message is causally obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624625/","volume":"52","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624625/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8888607","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rates in cognitive radio channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rates in cognitive radio channels","sourcePdf":"01624625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130547S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"34108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"749","xplore-issue":"34108","articleId":"1624625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624629,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We consider a special case of the general n-channel symmetric multiple-description problem where only a single parameter controls the redundancy tradeoffs between the central and the side distortions. Previous work on two-channel MD-LVQ showed that the distortions of the side quantizers can be expressed through the normalized second moment of a sphere. We show here that this is also the case for three-channel MD-LVQ. Furthermore, we conjecture that this is true for the general n-channel MD-LVQ. For given source, target rate, and packet-loss probabilities we find the optimal number of descriptions and construct the MD-LVQ system that minimizes the expected distortion. We verify theoretical expressions by numerical simulations and show in a practical setup that significant performance improvements can be achieved over state-of-the-art two-channel MD-LVQ by using three-channel MD-LVQ.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"n-channel entropy-constrained multiple-description lattice vector quantization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.872847","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/34108/01624634.pdf","startPage":"1956","endPage":"1973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.872847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624634/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"n-channel entropy-constrained multiple-description lattice vector quantization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624634/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888616","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"n-channel entropy-constrained multiple-description lattice vector quantization","sourcePdf":"01624634.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.259746S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"34108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"34108","articleId":"1624634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1624636,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Using information-theoretic arguments, we will show that if a sequence of output degree distributions is to achieve the capacity of the underlying channel, then the fraction of nodes of degree 2 in these degree distributions has to converge to a certain quantity depending on the channel. For the class of erasure channels this quantity is independent of the erasure probability of the channel, but for many other classes of BIMSCs, this fraction depends on the particular channel chosen.

However, these codes are instances of single-symbol decodable codes and it is natural to ask, if there exist codes other than STBCs form ODs and CIODs that allow single-symbol decoding? In this paper, the above question is answered in the affirmative by characterizing all linear STBCs, that allow single-symbol ML decoding (not necessarily full-diversity) over quasi-static fading channels-calling them single-symbol decodable designs (SDD). The class SDD includes ODs and CIODs as proper subclasses. Further, among the SDD, a class of those that offer full-diversity, called Full-rank SDD (FSDD) are characterized and classified. We then concentrate on square designs and derive the maximal rate for square FSDDs using a constructional proof. It follows that 1) except for N=2, square complex ODs are not maximal rate and 2) a rate one square FSDD exist only for two and four transmit antennas. For nonsquare designs, generalized coordinate-interleaved orthogonal designs (a superset of CIODs) are presented and analyzed. Finally, for rapid-fading channels an equivalent matrix channel representation is developed, which allows the results of quasi-static fading channels to be applied to rapid-fading channels. Using this representation we show that for rapid-fading channels the rate of single-symbol decodable STBCs are independent of the number of transmit antennas and inversely proportional to the block-length of the code. Significantly, the CIOD for two transmit antennas is the only STBC that is single-symbol decodable over both quasi-static and rapid-fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/34108/01624641.pdf","startPage":"2062","endPage":"2091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.872970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.872970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-symbol maximum likelihood decodable linear STBCs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Fading","MIMO","Block codes","Transmitting antennas","Digital modulation","Modulation coding","Convolutional codes","Councils","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time codes","block codes","linear codes","channel coding","interleaved codes","maximum likelihood decoding","fading channels","transmitting antennas","diversity reception","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time block code","linear STBC","coordinate interleaved orthogonal design","CIOD","maximum-likelihood decoding","quasistatic fading channel","single-symbol decodable design","full-rank SDD","FSDD","transmitting antenna","equivalent matrix channel representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity","fast ML decoding","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal designs","space\u2013time block codes (STBCs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Single-symbol maximum likelihood decodable linear STBCs","volume":"52","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624641/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888623","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-symbol maximum likelihood decodable linear STBCs","sourcePdf":"01624641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147033S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"34108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"34108","articleId":"1624641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1624642,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Often, these capacity gains are achievable only with some form of adaptive transmission. In this paper, we study the capacity loss (defined as the rate loss in bits/s/Hz) of the MIMO wireless system when the covariance matrix of the transmitted signal vector is designed using a low rate feedback channel. For the MIMO channel, we find a bound on the ergodic capacity loss when random codebooks, generated from the uniform distribution on the complex unit sphere, are used to convey the second order statistics of the transmitted signal from the receiver to the transmitter. In this case, we find a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity loss as a function of the number of bits fed back at each channel realization. These results show that the capacity loss decreases at least as O(2/sup -B/(2MMt-2)/) where B is the number of feedback bits, M/sub t/ is the number of transmit antennas, and M=min{M/sub r/,M/sub t/} where M/sub r/ is the number of receive antennas. In the high SNR regime, we present a new bound on the capacity loss that is tighter than the previously derived bound and show that the capacity loss decreases exponentially as a function of the number of feedback bits.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.872864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/34108/01624652.pdf","startPage":"2190","endPage":"2202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.872864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback rate-capacity loss tradeoff for limited feedback MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624652/","displayDocTitle":"Feedback rate-capacity loss tradeoff for limited feedback MIMO systems","volume":"52","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888634","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1624652/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback rate-capacity loss tradeoff for limited feedback MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"01624652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137332S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"34108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"34108","articleId":"1624652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1624653,"authors":[{"name":"Taesang Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Taesang Yoo","id":"37087269642"},{"name":"A.

We study lower and upper bounds of mutual information under channel estimation error, and show that the two bounds are tight for Gaussian inputs. Assuming Gaussian inputs we also derive tight lower bounds of ergodic and outage capacities and optimal transmitter power allocation strategies that achieve the bounds under perfect feedback. For the ergodic capacity, the optimal strategy is a modified waterfilling over the spatial (antenna) and temporal (fading) domains. This strategy is close to optimum under small feedback delays, but when the delay is large, equal powers should be allocated across spatial dimensions. For the outage capacity, the optimal scheme is a spatial waterfilling and temporal truncated channel inversion. Numerical results show that some capacity gain is obtained by spatial power allocation. Temporal power adaptation, on the other hand, gives negligible gain in terms of ergodic capacity, but greatly enhances outage performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.872984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.872984","startPage":"2203","endPage":"2214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/34108/01624653.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and power allocation for fading MIMO channels with channel estimation error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and power allocation for fading MIMO channels with channel estimation error","volume":"52","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","accessionNumber":"8888635","publicationDate":"May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624653/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and power allocation for fading MIMO channels with channel estimation error","sourcePdf":"01624653.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170091S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"34108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"536","xplore-issue":"34108","articleId":"1624653","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1624655,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A more complete data set of n- and p-channel MOSFET piezoresistance and strain-altered gate tunneling is presented along with new insight into the physical mechanisms responsible for hole mobility enhancement. Strained-Si hole mobility data are analyzed using six band k/spl middot/p calculations for stresses of technological importance: uniaxial longitudinal compressive and biaxial stress on [001] and [110] wafers. The calculations and experimental data show that low in-plane and large out-of-plane conductivity effective masses and a high density of states in the top band are all important for large hole mobility enhancement. This work suggests longitudinal compressive stress on [001] or [110] wafers and <110> channel direction offers the most favorable band structure for holes. The maximum Si inversion-layer hole mobility enhancement is estimated to be /spl sim/ 4 times higher for uniaxial stress on (100) wafer and /spl sim/ 2 times higher for biaxial stress on (100) wafer and for uniaxial stress on a [110] wafer.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/34109/01624680.pdf","startPage":"1010","endPage":"1020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2006.872088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2006.872088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniaxial-process-induced strained-Si: extending the CMOS roadmap","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Charge carrier mobility","Conductivity","Stress","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","hole mobility","electrical conductivity","elemental semiconductors","internal stresses","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniaxial process induced strain","strained-silicon","CMOS technology","logic technology","n-channel MOSFET piezoresistance","p-channel MOSFET piezoresistance","strain-altered gate tunneling","hole mobility enhancement","hole mobility data","uniaxial longitudinal compressive stress","biaxial stress","channel direction","uniaxial stress","45 nm","65 nm","90 nm","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","enhanced mobility","strained-silicon"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Uniaxial-process-induced strained-Si: extending the CMOS roadmap","volume":"53","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624680/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888557","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniaxial-process-induced strained-Si: extending the CMOS roadmap","sourcePdf":"01624680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129547S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"34109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"472","xplore-issue":"34109","articleId":"1624680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1624684,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The technology offers several benefits that enable scaling to sub-30-nm gate lengths including extremely low parasitic S/D resistance (1% of the total device resistance), atomically abrupt junctions that enable the physical scaling of the device to sub-10-nm gate lengths, superior control of OFF-state leakage current due to the intrinsic Schottky potential barrier, and elimination of parasitic bipolar action. These and other benefits accrue using a low-thermal-budget CMOS manufacturing process requiring two fewer masks than conventional bulk CMOS. The SB-CMOS manufacturing process enables integration of critical new materials such as high-k gate insulators and strained silicon substrates. SB MOSFET technology state of the art is also reviewed, and shown to be focused on barrier-height-lowering techniques that use interfacial layers between the metal S/Ds and the channel region. SB-PMOS devices tend to have superior performance compared to NMOS, but NMOS performance has recently improved by using ytterbium silicide or by using hybrid structures that incorporate interfacial layers to lower the SB height.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/34109/01624684.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2006.871842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2006.871842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview and status of metal S/D Schottky-barrier MOSFET technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Semiconductor device manufacture","Schottky barriers","Ytterbium compounds","Erbium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","semiconductor device manufacture","Schottky barriers","ytterbium compounds","erbium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metal source-drain Schottky-barrier","MOSFET technology","leakage current","parasitic bipolar action","CMOS manufacturing process","high-k gate insulators","strained silicon substrates","interfacial layers","SB-PMOS devices","ytterbium silicide","erbium silicide","intrinsic Schottky potential barrier","10 nm","30 nm","YbSi","ErSi"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOSFETs","erbium silicide","metal source/drain (S/D)","platinum silicide","Schottky barriers (SBs)","short-channel MOSFET","transistors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Overview and status of metal S/D Schottky-barrier MOSFET technology","volume":"53","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1624684/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888561","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview and status of metal S/D Schottky-barrier MOSFET technology","sourcePdf":"01624684.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123337S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"34109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"391","xplore-issue":"34109","articleId":"1624684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":1624689,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

Array of strain-sensitive sensor pixels is integrated on a pneumatically swollen silicon diaphragm with signal processing circuits in monolithic configuration. Elastic surface of the tactile image sensor is realized using repulsive force of the air pressure applied to diaphragm backside. Contact force distribution of an object is detected from the stress distribution change on the diaphragm using piezoresistor array. Force range and force sensitivity can be controlled by the pressure even after device packaging step. In this principle, fine pitch of pixels and a large-scale sensing array can be easily realized using the abilities of silicon CMOS technology. In addition, the movable stroke of sensor surface can be made much longer than the individually formed micromechanical pixels. A prototype device, of the new concept, with 3040 /spl times/ 3040 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ sensing diaphragm was fabricated with integrated 6 /spl times/ 6 array of 420-/spl mu/m pitch pixels. Increased movable stroke of the swollen diaphragm from the original surface is around 30 /spl mu/m at 23-kPa pressure at the top. Realized spatial resolution of the prototype device is approximately 400 /spl mu/m, which is determined by the relationship between the pixel pitch and mechanical crosstalk among the pixels. Positions of touch and their contact force amplitudes were detected as a two-dimensional distribution of the output voltage from the pixel array in a multipoint contact test. The maximum input-force range can be controlled from 21 to 176 mN by changing the backside pressure from 5 to 64 kPa. Through the evaluation of the fabricated device, major advantages of this tactile image sensor have been demonstrated successfully.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2006.872698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/34109/01624709.pdf","startPage":"1250","endPage":"1259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2006.872698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic silicon smart tactile image sensor with integrated strain sensor array on pneumatically swollen single-diaphragm structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1624709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624709/","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic silicon smart tactile image sensor with integrated strain sensor array on pneumatically swollen single-diaphragm structure","volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888586","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1624709/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic silicon smart tactile image sensor with integrated strain sensor array on pneumatically swollen single-diaphragm structure","sourcePdf":"01624709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082769S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"34109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"34109","articleId":"1624709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1624792,"authors":[{"name":"S.-G.

The detection system uses a MapCam (omni-camera) to capture images and performs image processing over the images. The personal information of each individual is considered in the processing task. The MapCam is used to capture 360deg scenes simultaneously and eliminate any blind viewing zone. The personal information is combined into the system and makes it smarter by customizing the system for each individual. With personal information such as height, weight, and electronic health history, we can adjust the detection sensitivity on a case by case basis to reduce unnecessary alarms, and put more attention on the elderly with special diseases or conditions. We perform a simple experiment to verify the feasibility of our approach. The experimental results show that the successful rates of fall detections with and without personal information are 79.8% and 68%, respectively.

To this end, we developed a prototype wearable monitoring system based on interoperability standards that demonstrates plug-and-play wireless connectivity between the system components. The system utilizes both device-level (IEEE 11073, Bluetooth) and system-level (Health Level (HL7), CORBA) standards. The wearable monitoring system stores data in a local database, and these data are then sent to a remote database via HL7 messages. The remote data can be viewed and processed with a graphical user interface created in Java that employs the CORBAmed PIDS and COAS services as implemented by OpenEMed.

We describe algebraically the aliasing process caused by spiral undersampling to formulate unaliasing as a set of independent inverse problems. Since each linear system is severely ill-conditioned, zeros are assumed in the solution. Specifically the size and the location of assumed zeros necessary for obtaining a unique solution is inspected. To overcome the problems of excessive memory and computation time needed for direct inverse computation, a fast implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method is proposed. Simulation using dynamic spiral cardiac images demonstrates improved temporal resolution of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2006.1624839","publicationTitle":"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10818/34114/01624839.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2006.1624839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of undersampled dynamic spiral MR images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of undersampled dynamic spiral MR images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1624839/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9054280","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1624839/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of undersampled dynamic spiral MR images","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01624839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039909S","chronDate":"6-9 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10818","isNumber":"34114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10818","xplore-issue":"34114","articleId":"1624839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1624936,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While their versatility is largely in part to their high degrees of freedom, the computation of the gradient of the similarity measure with respect to the many warp parameters becomes very time consuming. Recently, a simple stochastic approximation method using a small random subset of image pixels to approximate this gradient has been shown to be effective.

Non-uniform subsampling allows one to tailor the subsampling scheme for improved image quality at high acceleration factors. However, non-uniform subsampling precludes fast reconstruction schemes such as SENSE, and is more likely to require a regularized solution than reconstruction of uniformly subsampled data demands. This means that one needs to choose a good regularization parameter, typically requiring multiple expensive system solves. Here, we present an efficient LSQR-Hybrid algorithm which simultaneously addresses the need for rapid regularization parameter selection and fast reconstruction. This algorithm can reconstruct non-uniformly subsampled parallel MRI data, with automatic regularization and good image quality, in a time competitive with Cartesian SENSE.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Image reconstruction","Acceleration","Coils","Iterative algorithms","Image quality","Image coding","Linear systems","Equations","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","medical image processing","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast regularized reconstruction","nonuniformly subsampled parallel MRI data","LSQR-Hybrid algorithm","rapid regularization parameter selection","good image quality","Cartesian SENSE"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2006.1625016","publicationTitle":"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10818/34114/01625016.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2006.1625016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast regularized reconstruction of non-uniformly subsampled parallel MRI data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1625016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast regularized reconstruction of non-uniformly subsampled parallel MRI data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1625016/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1625016/","accessionNumber":"9054371","conferenceDate":"6-9 April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast regularized reconstruction of non-uniformly subsampled parallel MRI data","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01625016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055482S","chronDate":"6-9 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10818","isNumber":"34114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10818","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"34114","articleId":"1625016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1625062,"authors":[{"name":"Changqing Gao","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Research Center Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Changqing Gao","id":"37414217500"},{"name":"Jiayin Thou","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"lastName":"Jiayin Thou"},{"name":"Liang Mong Koh","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Research Center Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Liang Mong Koh","id":"37412658000"},{"name":"E.M.C.

Further cost reduction thereby is achievable through savings on the hardware resources dedicated to the real-time delay computation. By accounting for the group delay of the reconstruction filter, the proposed technique can also eliminate the image artifacts due to the signal distortion related to the delay update in dynamic receive focusing.

(1996), we adopt a space-varying AR(1) temporal noise model and assess its influence, on both the estimation of the HRF and the detection of brain activity, using synthetic and real fMRI data.

The selection of the proper number of signals of interest is an important step in the analysis to reduce the risk of over/underfilling. The inherent sample dependence in the spatial or temporal dimension of the fMRI data violates the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples and limits the usefulness of the practical formulations of information-theoretic order selection criteria. We propose a novel method using an entropy rate matching principle to mitigate the effects of such sample dependence in order selection. We perform order selection experiments on the simulated fMRI data and show that the incorporation of the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of the order selection by different criteria. We also use the proposed method to estimate the number of latent sources in fMRI data acquired from multiple subjects performing a visuomotor paradigm. We show that the proposed method improves the order selection by alleviating the over-estimation due to the intrinsic smoothness and the effect of smooth preprocessing on the fMRI data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1625107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 April 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1625107/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9060907","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sample dependence correction for order selection in fMRI analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample dependence correction for order selection in fMRI analysis","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01625107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048228S","chronDate":"6-9 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10818","isNumber":"34114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10818","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"34114","articleId":"1625107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1625131,"authors":[{"name":"C.-K.

In terms of simulation a novel approach of board-level electro-thermal simulation is presented whereas in terms of measurement, a combined thermal and radiometric characterization method is discussed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1625227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1625227/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9017152","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-domain simulation and measurement of power LED-s and power LED assemblies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-domain simulation and measurement of power LED-s and power LED assemblies","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01625227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04995S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10819","isNumber":"34115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10819","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"34115","articleId":"1625227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1625246,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The case of no extrinsic feedback corresponds to the conventional approach of exchanging extrinsic information, while full extrinsic feedback corresponds to exchanging a posteriori information.

In contrast to the existing correlation models, our new approach treats the scattering environment as non-separable and it is modeled using a bi-angular power distribution. The bi-angular power distribution is parameterized by the mean departure and arrival angles, angular spreads of the univariate angular power distributions at the transmitter and receiver apertures, and a third parameter, the covariance between transmit and receive angles which captures the statistical interdependency between angular power distributions at the transmitter and receiver apertures. When this third parameter is zero, this new model reduces to the well known \"Kronecker\" model. Using the proposed model, we show that Kronecker model is a good approximation to the actual channel when the scattering channel consists of a single scattering cluster. In the presence of multiple remote scattering clusters we show that Kronecker model over estimates the performance by artificially increasing the number of multipaths in the channel.","doi":"10.1109/AUSCTW.2006.1625262","publicationTitle":"2006 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/10822/34116/01625262.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUSCTW.2006.1625262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Channel Correlation in General Scattering Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1625262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1625262/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Channel Correlation in General Scattering Environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1625262/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Feb. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Channel Correlation in General Scattering Environments","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01625262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079327S","chronDate":"1-3 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10822","isNumber":"34116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10822","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"34116","articleId":"1625262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1625264,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

In contrast to per-survivor processing for Viterbi decoding, the approach here does not rely on tentative decisions from survivor paths, channel estimation filter coefficients can be pre-calculated, and the APP decoder delivers soft decisions.","doi":"10.1109/AUSCTW.2006.1625266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34116","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","pdfPath":"/iel5/10822/34116/01625266.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUSCTW.2006.1625266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"APP Convolutional Decoding with Transition-Based Systematic Channel Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Convolutional codes","Maximum likelihood estimation","Bit error rate","Viterbi algorithm","AWGN","Frequency estimation","State estimation","Phase shift keying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"APP Convolutional Decoding with Transition-Based Systematic Channel Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1625266/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1625266/","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"1-3 Feb. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"APP Convolutional Decoding with Transition-Based Systematic Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01625266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051211S","chronDate":"1-3 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10822","isNumber":"34116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10822","xplore-issue":"34116","articleId":"1625266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1625269,"authors":[{"name":"Z.B.

To achieve conflicting performances such as high linearity and wide dynamic range with constraints of low power dissipation, it is necessary for VGA to have an accurate gain control characteristic and a wideband gain cell (VGA cell) with high gain at low voltage. Therefore, a new VGA cell is proposed to achieve both high dynamic range and wideband at low supply voltage. Wideband operation is also achieved using novel active load with gain boosting. In a proposed exponential voltage function generator using parasitic bipolar transistor, it is possible to compensate some deviation of its slope against temperature and process variations. The VGA has a controllable gain range of -20dB\u223c+55dB which can be controlled by adjusting the external control voltage and enhanced operating frequency range up to 150 MHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1625697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Feb. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Feb. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1625697/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9072198","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Variable Gain Amplifier with Wide Dynamic Range and Accurate dB-Linear Characteristic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Variable Gain Amplifier with Wide Dynamic Range and Accurate dB-Linear Characteristic","confLoc":"Phoenix Park, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01625697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143513S","chronDate":"20-22 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10826","isNumber":"34120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10826","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34120","articleId":"1625697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1625724,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Moustafa Abd-El Aziz Moustafa","affiliation":["Electron. & Commun.

To solve this problem pre-equalization must be used by users employing the downlink channel response. The pre-equalization is effective for stationary channels with fixed users, but not for time-varying channels, since there is a big difference between downlink and uplink channel responses. For time-varying channels users should predict the uplink response from downlink observation. This paper proposes a method for the prediction by means of the spectral decomposition of downlink response. Computer simulation results show that the proposed method provides accurate prediction for high mobility users during the whole uplink transmission","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 8th International Conference Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/10826/34121/01625769.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","endPage":"1106","publicationTitle":"2006 8th International Conference Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2006.206164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2006.206164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1625769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of time-varying multipath fading channel for pre-equalization of the signal in uplink mobile MC-CDMA communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Mobile communication","Downlink","Prediction methods","AWGN","Time-varying channels","Frequency estimation","Predictive models","Delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","equalisers","fading channels","mobile communication","multipath channels","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying multipath fading channel","uplink mobile MC-CDMA communications","signal preequalization","downlink channel response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","pre-equalization","multi-path fading channel","model-based prediction method","ML estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1625769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of time-varying multipath fading channel for pre-equalization of the signal in uplink mobile MC-CDMA communications","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1625769/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9053581","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"20-22 Feb. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of time-varying multipath fading channel for pre-equalization of the signal in uplink mobile MC-CDMA communications","confLoc":"Phoenix Park, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01625769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136998S","chronDate":"20-22 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10826","isNumber":"34121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10826","xplore-issue":"34121","articleId":"1625769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1625808,"authors":[{"name":"Sunmi Kim","affiliation":["Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sunmi Kim","id":"37291928300"},{"name":"Jaewon Park","affiliation":["Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jaewon Park","id":"37066801400"},{"name":"Yongwan Park","affiliation":["Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yongwan Park","id":"37293566800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"89-5519-129-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1625808","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference cancellation","Multiple access interference","Multiuser detection","Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Silicon carbide","Bit error rate","Chirp modulation","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","multiuser detection","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space time block code","MIMO partial parallel interference cancellation","multiple access interference","MIMO-CDMA system","multiuser detection","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","CDMA","Multiple Access Interference","Multi-user Detection","Parallel Interference Cancellation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a simple and reliable MAI (multiple access interference) cancellation scheme for MIMO-CDMA system using STBC (space time block code).

The MACsec is a link security method proposed by IEEE 802.1AE WG and under standardization. We implement the MACsec on the basis of Draft suggested by IEEE 802.1AE. Our MAC security (MACsec) provides user data confidentiality, frame data integrity check, and data origin authentication. Also, it provides protection of security threats such as replay attack and DoS attack, etc. These security protections are provided by 128-bit GCM-AES cipher mechanism.

Moreover, to reduce feedback information for the beamforming, we also apply QEGT (Quantized Equal Gain Transmission) based on quantization of amplitudes and phases of beam weights that are multiplied by each data symbol for beamforming in the transmitter.

A drama manager (DM) is a system that watches a story as it progresses, reconfiguring the world to fulfill the author's goals. A DM might notice a player doing something that fits poorly with the current story and attempt to dissuade him or her. This is accomplished using soft actions such as having a nonplayer character start a conversation with a player to lure him or her to something else, or by more direct actions such as locking doors. We present work applying search-based drama management (SBDM) to the interactive fiction piece Anchorhead, to further investigate the algorithmic and authorship issues involved.

Transmission range reduction conserves energy and bandwidth consumption, while still maintaining network connectivity. However, the majority of these approaches assume a static network without mobility. In a mobile environment network connectivity can be compromised by two types of \"bad\" location information: inconsistent information, which makes a node select too few logical neighbors, and outdated information, which makes a node use too small a transmission range. In this paper, we first show some issues in existing topology control. Then, we propose a mobility-sensitive topology control method that extends many existing mobility-insensitive protocols. Two mechanisms are introduced: consistent local views that avoid inconsistent information and delay and mobility management that tolerate outdated information. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed through an extensive simulation study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626219/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","accessionNumber":"9014517","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1626219/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mobility-sensitive topology control in mobile ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility-sensitive topology control in mobile ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"01626219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083252S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"34134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"34134","articleId":"1626219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":1626222,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Traditional methods for sensor scheduling use either sensing coverage or network connectivity, but rarely both. In this paper, we deal with a challenging task: without accurate location information, how do we schedule sensor nodes to save energy and meet both constraints of sensing coverage and network connectivity? Our approach utilizes an integrated method that provides statistical sensing coverage and guaranteed network connectivity. We use random scheduling for sensing coverage and then turn on extra sensor nodes, if necessary, for network connectivity. Our method is totally distributed, is able to dynamically adjust sensing coverage with guaranteed network connectivity, and is resilient to time asynchrony. We present analytical results to disclose the relationship among node density, scheduling parameters, coverage quality, detection probability, and detection delay.

Fuzzy logic can be incorporated to ontology to represent uncertainty information. Typically, fuzzy ontology is generated from a predefined concept hierarchy. However, to construct a concept hierarchy for a certain domain can be a difficult and tedious task. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes the FOGA (fuzzy ontology generation framework) for automatic generation of fuzzy ontology on uncertainty information. The FOGA framework comprises the following components: fuzzy formal concept analysis, concept hierarchy generation, and fuzzy ontology generation. We also discuss approximating reasoning for incremental enrichment of the ontology with new upcoming data.

Because four kinds of 4 /spl times/ 4 transforms, i.e., forward, inverse, forward-Hadamard, and inverse-Hadamard transforms are required in a H.264 encoding system, a high-performance multitransform accelerator is inevitable to compute these transforms simultaneously for fitting real-time processing requirement. Accordingly, this paper proposes a direct 2-D transform algorithm which suitably arranges the data processing sequences adopted in row and column transforms of H.264 CODEC systems to finish the data transposition on-the-fly. The induced new transform architecture greatly increases the data processing rate up to 8 pixels/cycle. In addition, an interlaced I/O schedule is disclosed to balance the data I/O rate and the data processing rate of the proposed multitransform design when integrated with H.264 systems. Using a 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS technology, the optimum operating clock frequency of the proposed multitransform design is 100 MHz which achieves 800 Mpixels/s data throughput rate with the cost of 6482 gates. This performance can achieve the real-time multitransform processing of digital cinema video (4096 /spl times/ 4 2048@30 Hz). When the data throughput rate per unit area is adopted as the comparison index in hardware efficiency, the proposed design is at least 1.94 times more efficient than the existing designs. Moreover, the proposed multitransform design can achieve HDTV 720p, 1080i, digital cinema video processing requirements by consuming only 0.58, 2.91, and 24.18 mW when operated at 22, 50, and 100 MHz with 0.7, 1.0, and 1.8 V power supplies, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34137/01626279.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.872782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.872782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-performance direct 2-D transform coding IP design for MPEG-4AVC/H.264","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Data processing","CMOS technology","Throughput","Motion pictures","MPEG 4 Standard","Automatic voltage control","Video coding","Encoding","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transform coding","video coding","data compression","Hadamard transforms","Hadamard codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance direct 2D transform coding","IP design","MPEG-4 AVC-H.264","data processing algorithms","CMOS technology","video coding","Hadamard transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hadamard transform","HDTV","H.264","integer transform","MPEG-4/AVC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"A high-performance direct 2-D transform coding IP design for MPEG-4AVC/H.264","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1626279/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8891918","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-performance direct 2-D transform coding IP design for MPEG-4AVC/H.264","sourcePdf":"01626279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060148S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"34137","articleId":"1626279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1626280,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In the recent video coding standard H.264/AVC, a displacement vector resolution of 1/4-pel is applied. In order to estimate and compensate these fractional-pel displacements, interpolation filters are used. So far, these interpolation filters are invariant. The same filter with the same filter-coefficients is applied for all sequences and for all images of a sequence. Therefore, it is not possible to consider nonstationary statistical properties of the video signal and the motion compensated prediction process like aliasing, quantization errors, and displacement estimation errors. This paper presents two techniques that improve the motion compensated prediction and accordingly the coding efficiency. The first technique applies an adaptive interpolation filter that uses filter-coefficients which are adapted once per image. The adapted filter-coefficients are coded and transmitted. The second technique is based on an increased displacement vector resolution of 1/8-pel. In combination, the developed techniques indicate bit-rate reductions up to 25 % compared to H.264/AVC.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.870856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34137/01626280.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.870856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive interpolation filters and high-resolution displacements for video coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive interpolation filters and high-resolution displacements for video coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1626280/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8900418","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive interpolation filters and high-resolution displacements for video coding","sourcePdf":"01626280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055303S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"34137","articleId":"1626280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1626285,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Downsizing transcoding is one of the commonly used methods since it can reach very low bit rate without losing any motion information. Many efforts have been devoted to this research area. With the proposal of arbitrary downsizing, fine gradual reduction of bit rate and video quality becomes feasible. However, there is little research focusing on frame size selection for arbitrary downsizing transcoding. In this letter, the realization of arbitrary downsizing transcoding is discussed. Rate estimation scheme is applied on video sequences to choose the suitable frame size for the target bit rate. An efficient method is proposed to estimate the number of bits allocated to residue in requantization process. Experimental results show that, it can provide an accurate estimation and make a reliable decision in frame size selection.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.871324","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34137/01626285.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.871324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"540","endPage":"546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The realization of arbitrary downsizing video transcoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"The realization of arbitrary downsizing video transcoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626285/","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1626285/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8900423","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The realization of arbitrary downsizing video transcoding","sourcePdf":"01626285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081564S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"34137","articleId":"1626285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1626287,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Yeh Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Yeh Chen","id":"37280738200"},{"name":"Chao-Tsung Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chao-Tsung Huang","id":"37281275000"},{"name":"Yi-Hau Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Hau Chen","id":"37423650200"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Liang-Gee Chen","id":"37280381000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"1626287","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":501},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"The memory bandwidth reduction for motion estimation is important because of the power consumption and limited memory bandwidth in video coding systems. In this paper, we propose a Level C+ scheme which can fully reuse the overlapped searching region in the horizontal direction and partially reuse the overlapped searching region in the vertical direction to save more memory bandwidth compared to the Level C scheme. However, direct implementation of the Level C+ scheme may conflict with some important coding tools and then induces a lower hardware efficiency of video coding systems. Therefore, we propose n-stitched zigzag scan for the Level C+ scheme and discuss two types of 2-stitched zigzag scan for MPEG-4 and H.264 as examples. They can reduce memory bandwidth and solve the conflictions. When the specification is HDTV 720p, where the searching range is [-128,128), the required memory bandwidth is only 54%, and the increase of on-chip memory size is only 12% compared to those of traditional Level C data reuse scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34137/01626287.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.871388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.871388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Level C+ data reuse scheme for motion estimation with corresponding coding orders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Bandwidth","Video coding","Hardware","Video compression","Energy consumption","HDTV","Concurrent computing","Chaotic communication","MPEG 4 Standard"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","video coding","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["level C+ data reuse scheme","motion estimation","video coding systems","MPEG-4","H.264","memory bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data reuse","memory bandwidth","motion estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Level C+ data reuse scheme for motion estimation with corresponding coding orders","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1626287/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8900425","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Level C+ data reuse scheme for motion estimation with corresponding coding orders","sourcePdf":"01626287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053468S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"34137","articleId":"1626287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1626300,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihai He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/34138/1626300/1626300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhihai He received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, in 1994, the M.S. degree in mathematics from Institute of Computational Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2001.","In 2001, he joined Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, as a Member of Technical Staff.

Compared to traditional communication system, the WVSN operates under a set of unique resource constraints, including limitations with respect to energy supply, on-board computational capability, and transmission bandwidth. The objective of this paper is to study the resource utilization behavior of a wireless video sensor and analyze its performance under the resource constraints. More specifically, we develop an analytic power-rate-distortion (P-R-D) model to characterize the inherent relationship between the power consumption of a video encoder and its rate-distortion performance. Based on the P-R-D analysis and a simplified model for wireless transmission power, we study the optimum power allocation between video encoding and wireless transmission and introduce a measure called achievable minimum distortion to quantify the distortion under a total power constraint. We consider two scenarios in wireless video sensing, small-delay wireless video monitoring and large-delay wireless video surveillance, and analyze the performance limit of the wireless video sensor in each scenario. The analysis and results obtained in this paper provide an important guideline for practical wireless video sensor design.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34138/01626300.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation and performance analysis of wireless video sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626300/","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation and performance analysis of wireless video sensors","volume":"16","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8921607","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1626300/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation and performance analysis of wireless video sensors","sourcePdf":"01626300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089985S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"34138","articleId":"1626300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1626301,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Kuang Tu","affiliation":["Media Processing Laboratory, Institute Computer and Communication Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/34138/1626301/1626301-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Kuang Tu was born in Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1976.

The best mode is chosen from the one with the minimum Lagrange cost. To avoid the expensive computation of Lagrange costs, in this paper, we propose transform-domain bit-rate estimation and distortion measures, based on quantized and inverse quantized integer transform coefficients, for the inter-mode decision in H.264/AVC coders. With the proposed scheme, entropy coding, inverse transform, and pixel-reconstructions are not required in the process. With ignorable degradation in coding performance, simulations demonstrate that the proposed estimation method achieves about 40% reduced computation time of rate-distortion cost for the inter-mode decision and saves about 17% total encoding time while combining with fast motion estimation and fast mode decision algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34138/01626301.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"611","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient rate-distortion estimation for H.264/AVC coders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Efficient rate-distortion estimation for H.264/AVC coders","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1626301/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8921608","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient rate-distortion estimation for H.264/AVC coders","sourcePdf":"01626301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083249S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"34138","articleId":"1626301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1626303,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

Experiments show that the best results are obtained by the Scalable Color and Homogenous Texture descriptors, especially if only relevant coefficients are used.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34138/01626303.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"637","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPEG-7 Visual Descriptors\u2014Contributions for Automated Feature Extraction in Capsule Endoscopy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"MPEG-7 Visual Descriptors\u2014Contributions for Automated Feature Extraction in Capsule Endoscopy","htmlLink":"/document/1626303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPEG-7 Visual Descriptors\u2014Contributions for Automated Feature Extraction in Capsule Endoscopy","sourcePdf":"01626303.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079233S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"34138","articleId":"1626303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1626308,"authors":[{"name":"Minqiang Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Minqiang Jiang","id":"37270835800"},{"name":"Nam Ling","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Nam Ling","id":"37271347700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"1626308","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":50,"totalDownloads":1106},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Lagrange multiplier and quantizer adjustment for H.264 frame-layer video rate control","abstract":"H.264/AVC encoder employs a complex mode-decision technique based on rate-distortion optimization. It calculates rate-distortion cost (RDcost) for all possible modes to choose the best one having the minimum RDcost. This paper presents a frame-layer rate control for H.264/AVC that computes the Lagrange multiplier (/spl lambda//sub MODE/) for mode decision by using a quantization parameter (QP) which may be different from that used for encoding. At the same time, we also compare actual bits produced by previous macroblocks (MBs) with the total bits allocated to these MBs to further modify /spl lambda//sub MODE/. The objective of these measures aims to produce bits as close to the frame target bits for rate control as possible. This is very important in the case of low-bit-rate tight buffer applications. In order to obtain an accurate QP for a frame, we employ a complexity-based bit-allocation scheme and a QP adjustment method. Simulation results comparing with the H.264 Joint Video Team (JVT) rate control method show that the H.264 encoder, using the proposed algorithm, achieves a visual quality improvement of about 0.56 dB, performs better for buffer overflow and underflow, and achieves a smaller PSNR deviation.","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/34138/01626308.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873159","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873159","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626308","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lagrangian functions","Quadratic programming","Rate-distortion","Automatic voltage control","Costs","Quantization","Encoding","Video coding","Motion estimation","Buffer overflow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","computational complexity","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lagrange multiplier","quantizer adjustment","H.264 frame-layer video rate control","H.264/AVC encoder","rate-distortion optimization","complexity-based bit-allocation scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AVC","bit allocation","H.264","Joint Video Team (JVT)","Lagrange multiplier","rate-distortion optimization (RDO)","rate control","video coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"On Lagrange multiplier and quantizer adjustment for H.264 frame-layer video rate control","accessionNumber":"8921615","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1626308/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Lagrange multiplier and quantizer adjustment for H.264 frame-layer video rate control","sourcePdf":"01626308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056398S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"34138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"34138","articleId":"1626308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1626321,"authors":[{"name":"Y.Z.

It produces cross-sectional images of blood vessels that provide quantitative assessment of the vascular wall, information about the nature of atherosclerotic lesions as well as plaque shape and size. Automatic processing of large IVUS data sets represents an important challenge due to ultrasound speckle, catheter artifacts or calcification shadows. A new three-dimensional (3-D) IVUS segmentation model, that is based on the fast-marching method and uses gray level probability density functions (PDFs) of the vessel wall structures, was developed. The gray level distribution of the whole IVUS pullback was modeled with a mixture of Rayleigh PDFs. With multiple interface fast-marching segmentation, the lumen, intima plus plaque structure, and media layers of the vessel wall were computed simultaneously. The PDF-based fast-marching was applied to 9 in vivo IVUS pullbacks of superficial femoral arteries and to a simulated IVUS pullback. Accurate results were obtained on simulated data with average point to point distances between detected vessel wall borders and ground truth <0.072 mm. On in vivo IVUS, a good overall performance was obtained with average distance between segmentation results and manually traced contours <0.16 mm. Moreover, the worst point to point variation between detected and manually traced contours stayed low with Hausdorff distances <0.40 mm, indicating a good performance in regions lacking information or containing artifacts. In conclusion, segmentation results demonstrated the potential of gray level PDF and fast-marching methods in 3-D IVUS image processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8896177","pubMedId":"16689263","volume":"25","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1626322/","publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Intravascular ultrasound image segmentation: a three-dimensional fast-marching method based on gray level distributions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intravascular ultrasound image segmentation: a three-dimensional fast-marching method based on gray level distributions","sourcePdf":"01626322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083593S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"34139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"34139","articleId":"1626322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1626323,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In parallel multi-tasking operations, a combination of real-time Linux operating system and an ultra-fast network forms the backbone for the internal communication between the 16 powerful processors of the Xeon-Cluster. Field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based multi-channel digital and analog I/O ports are interfaced to communicate with the external hardware components. The model development software utilized for power applications is based on the highly customizable industry-standard MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. A detailed case study of the real-time simulation of a three-level 12-pulse vector-controlled ac drive is presented to illustrate the precision capabilities of the simulator. Multiple integration algorithms and multirate computation have been applied for the simulation of the system, with slow (machine) and fast (converter) dynamic components. Real-time simulation of the entire system has been achieved with a maximum computation time of 5.35 /spl mu/s on a step-size of 10 /spl mu/s for the first time. Results obtained from the real-time simulation have been validated with an offline simulation using PSCAD/EMTDC.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626347.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A versatile cluster-based real-time digital simulator for power engineering research","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626347/","displayDocTitle":"A versatile cluster-based real-time digital simulator for power engineering research","volume":"21","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8983627","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1626347/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A versatile cluster-based real-time digital simulator for power engineering research","sourcePdf":"01626347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10444S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1626350,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To overcome these difficulties, a new procedure for selection of an initial set of complex voltages at generator-buses is proposed in this paper. With this procedure, one can start the optimization process (i.e., genetic algorithm) with a set of control variables, causing few or no violations of constraints. The application of voltage angles at generator-buses as control variables and the proposed initialization procedure is illustrated on the IEEE test systems.

After briefly reviewing applications of different interval analysis tools (interval matrix inversion and various contractors and solvers for systems of interval equations), we propose two tailored algorithms. In the first (basic LP approach), we propose another solver for a system of linear interval equations, while in the second (power system-customized LP approach), we use features of the power system model to reduce the width of the interval solution. The interval-based results are compared with a deterministic robust noninterval matrix inversion-based solution of a model of the benchmark 68-node New England/New York interconnected power system.

Power injections from DGs change network power flows modifying energy losses. Although it is considered that DG reduce losses, this paper shows that this is not always true. This paper presents an approach to compute annual energy losses variations when different penetration and concentration levels of DG are connected to a distribution network. In addition, the impact on losses of different DG technologies, such as combined heat and power, wind power, photovoltaic, and fuel-cells, is analyzed. Results show that energy losses variation, as a function of the DG penetration level, presents a characteristic U-shape trajectory. Moreover, when DG units are more dispersed along network feeders, higher losses reduction can be expected. Regarding DG technologies, it should be noted that wind power is the one that shows the worst behavior in losses reduction. Finally, DG units with reactive power control provide a better network voltage profile and lower losses.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed control","Energy loss","Wind energy","Load flow","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Power system analysis computing","Cogeneration","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution networks","losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy distribution losses","distributed generation","traditional electric power system","network power flow","annual energy losses","combine heat and power","wind power","photovoltaic","fuel cells","U-shape trajectory","network feeders","losses reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed generation (DG)","distribution","losses"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873115","startPage":"533","endPage":"540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626356.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of energy distribution losses for increasing penetration of distributed generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Assessment of energy distribution losses for increasing penetration of distributed generation","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8983636","publicationDate":"May 2006","volume":"21","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1626356/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of energy distribution losses for increasing penetration of distributed generation","sourcePdf":"01626356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068945S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"356","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":1626358,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, stochastic subspace identification is employed to extract the critical mode(s) from the measured ambient noise without requiring artificial disturbances (e.g., line outages, generator tripping, and adding/removing loads), so that the identified critical mode may be used as an online index to predict the closest oscillatory instability. The proposed index is not only independent of system models and truly represents the actual system, but it is also computationally efficient. The application of the proposed index to several realistic test systems is examined using a transient stability program and PSCAD/EMTDC, which has detailed models that can capture the full dynamic response of the system. The results show the feasibility of using the proposed identification technique and index for online detection of proximity to oscillatory stability problems.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626378.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oscillatory stability limit prediction using stochastic subspace identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Oscillatory stability limit prediction using stochastic subspace identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1626378/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8983658","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oscillatory stability limit prediction using stochastic subspace identification","sourcePdf":"01626378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077176S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1626379,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

The performance of the controller is validated in real time using a detailed model of the power system implemented using Linux PC-based, multi-processor technology. The coupling between the controller and the power system is through a set of DAC and ADC modules in the analogue domain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626386.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"816","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and real-time implementation of robust FACTS controller for damping inter-area oscillation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Design and real-time implementation of robust FACTS controller for damping inter-area oscillation","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1626386/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8991905","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and real-time implementation of robust FACTS controller for damping inter-area oscillation","sourcePdf":"01626386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049442S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":1626387,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Wen","affiliation":["Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc., Taylor, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaoyu Wen (S'02) received the B.S.E.E. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1996 and 1999 respectively.

This problem is difficult to solve since several constraints with continuous and discrete variables exist, including hydraulic coupling, storage and released flow limits of the reservoirs, and unit forbidden operation zones. The forbidden zones cause a noncontinuous operation of the generating units, making the solution of the problem more difficult, due to the associated combinatorial nature. Moreover, there exists the presence of nonlinear functions that represent the tailrace level, the hydraulic losses, and the unit efficiency. To solve a problem that contains all of these characteristics is a challenging task. Within this scenario, an algorithm is presented that makes use of Lagrangian relaxation, in which some variables are artificially duplicated in order to separate the problem into simpler subproblems. The idea is to relax the spatial and temporal coupling present in the constraints associated with the forbidden zones. In order to solve the subproblems of nonlinear continuous nature that result from the relaxation, this paper presents a sequential quadratic programming algorithm. To update the Lagrange multipliers, an algorithm based on the Bundle Method is used. We assess our approach on a real-life hydroelectric configuration, proving the conceptual and practical feasibility of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626389/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8991908","htmlLink":"/document/1626389/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solving the hydro unit commitment problem via dual decomposition and sequential quadratic programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving the hydro unit commitment problem via dual decomposition and sequential quadratic programming","sourcePdf":"01626389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100575S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1626390,"authors":[{"name":"Mao Xiao-ming","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Mao Xiao-ming received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China, in 1996.

Both the stability and small-signal analysis environments of 2005 CSG are established using a commercial software package. Interarea oscillatory modes among the four provincial power grids are then investigated. On the basis of modal analysis, a hierarchical optimization scheme is implemented for the parameter setting of selected power system stabilizers (PSS) and HVDC damping controllers.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid load forecasting algorithm, which combines the fuzzy linear regression method and the general exponential smoothing method with the analysis of temperature sensitivities. The fuzzy linear regression method is used to consider the lower load-demands in weekends and Monday than on weekdays. The normal load of weekdays is forecasted by the general exponential smoothing method. Moreover, the temperature sensitivities are used to improve the accuracy of the load forecasting with the relation to the daily load and temperature.

The SCUC model includes unit commitment, ac security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF), and load shedding (LS) for steady state and contingencies. The objective of this SCUC model is to obtain the minimum bid-based system operating cost while maintaining the system security. The prevailing generation constraints, such as hourly power demand, system reserves, fuel and emission limits, ramp up/down limits, and minimum up/down time limits, are included in this model. In addition, system constraints such as time-limited emergency controls for a given contingency and ac network security limits are taken into account. The proposed ac solution for the hourly scheduling of generating units is based on Benders decomposition. Case studies with the six-bus system, the IEEE 118-bus test system, and 1168-bus system are presented in detail in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AC contingency dispatch based on security-constrained unit commitment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873407","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626396.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626396/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"AC contingency dispatch based on security-constrained unit commitment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1626396/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8991915","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AC contingency dispatch based on security-constrained unit commitment","sourcePdf":"01626396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134711S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1626398,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.P.

A key aspect for building specific tariff structures is the identification of the consumption patterns of the customers, in order to form specific customer classes containing customers exhibiting similar patterns. This paper illustrates and compares the results obtained by using various unsupervised clustering algorithms (modified follow-the-leader, hierarchical clustering, K-means, fuzzy K-means) and the self-organizing maps to group together customers with similar electrical behavior. Furthermore, this paper discusses and compares various techniques-Sammon map, principal component analysis (PCA), and curvilinear component analysis (CCA)-able to reduce the size of the clustering input data set, in order to allow for storing a relatively small amount of data in the database of the distribution service provider for customer classification purposes. The effectiveness of the classifications obtained with the algorithms tested is compared in terms of a set of clustering validity indicators. Results obtained on a set of nonresidential customers are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626400.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparisons among clustering techniques for electricity customer classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Principal component analysis","Buildings","Databases","Testing","Pattern analysis","Condition monitoring","Neural networks","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tariffs","fuzzy set theory","self-organising feature maps","principal component analysis","power distribution","electricity supply industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustering techniques","electricity customer classification","electricity business regulation","electricity providers","tariff structures","unsupervised clustering algorithms","hierarchical clustering","fuzzy K-means","Sammon map","self-organizing maps","principal component analysis","PCA","curvilinear component analysis","distribution service providers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","curvilinear component analysis","customer classification","follow-the-leader","fuzzy K-means","hierarchical clustering","K-means","load pattern","principal component analysis","Sammon map","self-organizing map (SOM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparisons among clustering techniques for electricity customer classification","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1626400/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8991919","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparisons among clustering techniques for electricity customer classification","sourcePdf":"01626400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065827S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"324","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":1626402,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This research reduces the searching space (population) when a new codification strategy and novel genetic operators, called accentuated crossover and directed mutation, are used. This allows a drastic reduction of the computational time and minimizes the memory requirements, ensuring a efficiency search when compared to current GA reconfiguration techniques. The reduced population is created through the branches that form \"system loops.\" This means that almost all individuals created for the GA are feasible (radial networks) generating topologies that can only be limited by the system's operational constraints. The results of the proposed reconfiguration method are compared with other techniques, yielding smaller or equal power loss values with less computational efforts.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873124","startPage":"948","endPage":"954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626402.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimal loss reconfiguration using genetic algorithms with restricted population and addressed operators: real application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626402/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Minimal loss reconfiguration using genetic algorithms with restricted population and addressed operators: real application","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1626402/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8991921","publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal loss reconfiguration using genetic algorithms with restricted population and addressed operators: real application","sourcePdf":"01626402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129875S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1626404,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

Windpower presently is the fastest growing power generation sector in the world. However, windpower is intermittent. To be able to trade efficiently, make the best use of transmission line capability, and address concerns with system frequency in a re-regulated system, accurate very short-term forecasts are essential. The research introduces a novel approach-the application of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to forecasting a wind time series. Over the very short-term forecast interval, both windspeed and wind direction are important parameters. To be able to be gain the most from a forecast on this time scale, the turbines must be directed toward on oncoming wind. For this reason, this paper forecasts wind vectors, rather than windspeed or power output.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626404.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very short-term wind forecasting for Tasmanian power generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Very short-term wind forecasting for Tasmanian power generation","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8991923","htmlLink":"/document/1626404/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very short-term wind forecasting for Tasmanian power generation","sourcePdf":"01626404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083139S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"34141","articleId":"1626404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1626407,"authors":[{"name":"Ld.S.

The differential evolution (DE) algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that uses a rather greedy and less stochastic approach to problem solving than do classical evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, and evolution strategies. DE also incorporates an efficient way of self-adapting mutation using small populations. The potentialities of DE are its simple structure, easy use, convergence property, quality of solution, and robustness. This paper proposes a new approach for solving economic load dispatch problems with valve-point effect. The proposed method combines the DE algorithm with the generator of chaos sequences and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique to optimize the performance of economic dispatch problems. The DE with chaos sequences is the global optimizer, and the SQP is used to fine-tune the DE run in a sequential manner. The combined methodology and its variants are validated for two test systems consisting of 13 and 40 thermal units whose incremental fuel cost function takes into account the valve-point loading effects. The proposed combined method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in solving load dispatch problems with the valve-point effect.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34141","startPage":"989","endPage":"996","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/34141/01626407.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining of chaotic differential evolution and quadratic programming for economic dispatch optimization with valve-point effect","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1626407/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combining of chaotic differential evolution and quadratic programming for economic dispatch optimization with valve-point effect","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8991926","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining of chaotic differential evolution and quadratic programming for economic dispatch optimization with valve-point effect","sourcePdf":"01626407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098439S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"Feb","isNumber":"34141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"378","xplore-issue":"2","articleId":"1626407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1626409,"authors":[{"name":"N.

As an economically efficient mechanism, nodal pricing would properly reward DG for reducing line losses through increased revenues at nodal prices and signal prospective DG where it ought to connect with the distribution network. Applying nodal pricing to a model distribution network, we show significant price differences between buses reflecting high marginal losses. Moreover, we show the contribution of a DG resource located at the end of the network to significant reductions in losses and line loading.

These assumptions break down in many practical systems, where, by adapting the physical layer channel coding or transmission diversity, different tradeoffs between rate and reliability can be achieved. In network utility maximization problems formulated in this paper, the utility for each user depends on both transmission rate and signal quality, with an intrinsic tradeoff between the two. Each link may also provide a higher (or lower) rate on the transmission \"pipes\" by allowing a higher (or lower) decoding error probability. Despite nonseparability and nonconvexity of these optimization problems, we propose new price-based distributed algorithms and prove their convergence to the globally optimal rate-reliability tradeoff under readily-verifiable sufficient conditions. We first consider networks in which the rate-reliability tradeoff is controlled by adapting channel code rates in each link's physical-layer error correction codes, and propose two distributed algorithms based on pricing, which respectively implement the \"integrated\" and \"differentiated\" policies of dynamic rate-reliability adjustment. In contrast to the classical price-based rate control algorithms, in our algorithms, each user provides an offered price for its own reliability to the network, while the network provides congestion prices to users. The proposed algorithms converge to a tradeoff point between rate and reliability, which we prove to be a globally optimal one for channel codes with sufficiently large coding length and utilities whose curvatures are sufficiently negative. Under these conditions, the proposed algorithms can thus generate the Pareto optimal tradeoff curves between rate and reliability for all the users. In addition, the distributed algorithms and convergence proofs are extended for wireless multiple-inpit-multiple-output multihop networks, in which diversity and multiplexing gains of each link are controlled to achieve the optimal rate-reliability tradeoff. Numerical examples confirm that there can be significant enhancement of the network utility by distributively trading-off rate and reliability, even when only some of the links can implement dynamic reliability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Price-based distributed algorithms for rate-reliability tradeoff in network utility maximization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.872877","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/34142/01626423.pdf","startPage":"962","endPage":"976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.872877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626423/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Price-based distributed algorithms for rate-reliability tradeoff in network utility maximization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1626423/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8887063","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Price-based distributed algorithms for rate-reliability tradeoff in network utility maximization","sourcePdf":"01626423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166472S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"34142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"34142","articleId":"1626423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1626427,"authors":[{"name":"M.

At the heart of our model is a user of a certain type, an intrinsic and private parameter that reflects the user's willingness to contribute resources to the system. A user decides whether to contribute or free-ride based on how the current contribution cost in the system compares to her type. We study the impact of mechanisms that exclude low type users or, more realistically, penalize free-riders with degraded service. We also consider dynamic scenarios with arrivals and departures of users, and with whitewashers -users who leave the system and rejoin with new identities to avoid reputational penalties. We find that imposing penalty on all users that join the system is effective under many scenarios. In particular, system performance degrades significantly only when the turnover rate among users is high. Finally, we show that the optimal exclusion or penalty level differs significantly from the level that optimizes the performance of contributors only for a limited range of societal generosity levels.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.872882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/34142/01626427.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.872882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34142","startPage":"1010","endPage":"1019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-riding and whitewashing in peer-to-peer systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Free-riding and whitewashing in peer-to-peer systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8887067","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1626427/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free-riding and whitewashing in peer-to-peer systems","sourcePdf":"01626427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093658S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"34142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"34142","articleId":"1626427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1626432,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/34142/1626432/1626432-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianwei Huang (S'01\u2013M'06) received the B.E. degree in radio engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ.

Under the assumption that each user has a limited budget for bidding, we show the existence of a Nash equilibrium strategy, and the Nash equilibrium leads to a unique allocation for certain channel state distribution, such as the exponential distribution and the uniform distribution over [0, 1]. For uniformly distributed channel state, we establish that the aggregate throughput received by the users using the Nash equilibrium strategy is at least 3/4 of what can be obtained using an optimal centralized allocation that does not take fairness into account. We also show that the Nash equilibrium strategy leads to an allocation that is Pareto optimal (i.e., it is impossible to make some users better off without making some other users worse off). Based on the Nash equilibrium strategies of the second-price auction with money constraint, we further propose a centralized opportunistic scheduler that does not suffer the shortcomings associated with the proportional fair scheduler.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/34142/01626433.pdf","startPage":"1085","endPage":"1096","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.872890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.872890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless channel allocation using an auction algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","Nash equilibrium","Resource management","Fading","Throughput","Transmitters","Bandwidth","Satellites","Wireless networks","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless channels","channel allocation","fading channels","electronic commerce","Pareto optimisation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless channel allocation","fading channel","second-price auction mechanism","Nash equilibrium strategy","channel state distribution","Pareto optimal allocation","money constraint","centralized opportunistic scheduler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auction","channel allocation","wireless communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Wireless channel allocation using an auction algorithm","volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1626433/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8887073","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless channel allocation using an auction algorithm","sourcePdf":"01626433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092706S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"34142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"34142","articleId":"1626433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1626446,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Sets of 330 mm wafers with active devices such as 65-nm MOSFETs and 4-MB SRAMs were bonded face-to-face using copper pads with size ranging between 5 \u03bcm\u00d75 \u03bcm and 6 \u03bcm\u00d740 \u03bcm. The top wafers were thinned to different thicknesses in the range 5 to 28 \u03bcm. Through-silicon-vias (TSVs) and backside metallization were used to enable electrical testing of both wafers in the Cu-stacked configuration. We tested individual transistors in the thinned silicon of bonded wafer pairs where the thinned silicon thickness ranged from 14 to 19 \u03bcm. All results showed that both n- and p-channel transistors preserved their electrical characteristics after Cu bonding, thinning, and TSV integration. We also demonstrated the functionality of stacked 65-nm 4-MB SRAMs by independently testing the cells in both the thinned wafer and the bottom wafer. For the SRAM, we tested a wider thinned wafer thickness range from 5 to 28 \u03bcm. On all tested samples, we did not find any impact to the electrical performance of the arrays resulting from the three-dimensional (3-D) integration process. The stacked SRAM is an experimental demonstration of the use of 3-D integration to effectively double transistor packing density for the same planar footprint. The results presented in this letter enable further exploratory work in high-performance 3-D logic, which takes advantage of the improved interconnect delays offered by this Cu-bonding stacking scheme integrated with modern CMOS processes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/34143/01626449.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/LED.2006.873424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2006.873424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34143","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional wafer stacking via Cu-Cu bonding integrated with 65-nm strained-Si/low-k CMOS technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Stacking","Wafer bonding","Testing","MOSFETs","Copper","Silicon","Random access memory","Metallization","Electric variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","wafer bonding","MOSFET","SRAM chips","stacking","cryogenic electronics","silicon","copper"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D wafer stacking","strained silicon","low-k CMOS technology","integrating wafer stacking","MOSFET","SRAM","copper pad","backside metallization","electrical testing","copper-stacked configuration","4 MByte","14 to 19 micron","28 micron","65 nm","330 nm","Si","Cu-Cu"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","copper bonding","through-silicon-vias (TSVs)","wafer stacking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional wafer stacking via Cu-Cu bonding integrated with 65-nm strained-Si/low-k CMOS technology","volume":"27","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1626449/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8888716","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional wafer stacking via Cu-Cu bonding integrated with 65-nm strained-Si/low-k CMOS technology","sourcePdf":"01626449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094373S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"34143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"34143","articleId":"1626449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1626450,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The desired models must be suitable for representing the actual excitation equipment performance for large, severe disturbances as well as for small perturbations. A 1968 IEEE Committee Report (see [B18]) provided initial excitation system reference models. It established a common nomenclature, presented mathematical models for excitation systems then in common use, and defined parameters for those models. A 1981 report (see IEEE Committee Report [B20]) extended that work. It provided models for newer types of excitation equipment not covered previously as well as improved models for older equipment. This document, based heavily on the 1981 report, is intended to again update the models, provide models for additional control features, and formalize those models in a recommended practice. To some extent, the model structures presented in this document are intended to facilitate the use of field test data as a means of obtaining model parameters. The models are, however, reduced order models, and they do not represent all of the control loops on any particular system. In some cases, the model used may represent a substantial reduction, resulting in large differences between the structure of the model and the physical system. The excitation system models themselves do not allow for regulator modulation as a function of system frequency, an inherent characteristic of some older excitation systems. The models are valid for frequency deviations of +/-5% from rated frequency and oscillation frequencies up to about 3 Hz. These models would not normally be adequate for use in studies of subsynchronous resonance or other shaft torsional interaction problems. Delayed protective and control functions that may come into play in long-term dynamic performance studies are not represented. See additional information in Annex F. Where possible, the supplied models are referenced to commercial equipment and vendor names shown in Annex I. This information is given for the convenience of users of this recommended practice and does not constitute an endorsement by the IEEE of these products. The models thus referenced may be appropriate for equivalent excitation systems supplied by other manufacturers. A sample set of data (not necessarily typical) for each of the models, for at least one particular application, is provided in Annex H. A suffix \"A\" is used for the designation of models introduced or modified in IEEE Std 421.5-1992, and a suffix \"B\" is used for models introduced or modified in this latest recommended practice,IEEE Std 421.5-2005.

In this paper, a method named adaptive PSO is introduced to automatically select the beam angles for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning. To date, the improvements in automatic beam angle selection are still not quite satisfying, especially on the optimization efficiency because of the handicap of huge hyperspace of solutions. In the proposed algorithm, the beam angles are selected using PSO, followed by a beam intensity map optimization using conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm for each updated beam configuration. This PSO-based algorithm is verified by a relatively complex clinical prostate tumor case. In addition, the efficiency is compared with a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach. The preliminary results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible for the beam angle selection problem in IMRT planning. Furthermore, PSO appears more efficient than GA, according to the limited test case in this paper. Further study is needed to test the proposed method with more clinical cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626584","pdfPath":"/iel5/10831/34146/01626584.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"425 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive particle swarm optimizer for beam angle selection in radiotherapy planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2005-Aug. 1 2005","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive particle swarm optimizer for beam angle selection in radiotherapy planning","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","accessionNumber":"8932104","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1626584/","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive particle swarm optimizer for beam angle selection in radiotherapy planning","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060228S","chronDate":"July 29 2005-Aug. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34146","articleId":"1626584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1626593,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In the past few years, it has been applied to both homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-agent systems. In previous studies, the coordination among agents were implemented based on the designer's knowledge of the system. For large complex systems, it would be desirable if we can plan the coordination among agents dynamically. In this study, we demonstrate that an intelligent planner can be designed for the CHA framework to automatically generate desired actions for multiple robots in a multiagent system. The proposed intelligent planner is based on the construction of a biologically inspired neural network. The dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting neural equation. A landscape of the neural activities for all neurons of a CHA agent contains information about the agent's local goal, permanent obstacles and temporary obstacles. Each agent treats other robots as moving obstacles. The objective for building the intelligent planner is to plan actions for multiple mobile robots to coordinate with others and to achieve the global goal while each agent achieves its local goal. Simulation results show that in order to control a large complex system, an intelligent planner can be designed for the CHA framework so that coordination among agents can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626631/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8932130","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1626631/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network based intelligent planner for the coordinated hybrid agent framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based intelligent planner for the coordinated hybrid agent framework","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08791S","chronDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34147","articleId":"1626631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1626663,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Hong-jian","affiliation":["Mechatronic Engineering Department, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Wang Hong-jian","id":"37087767186"},{"name":"Zhao Jie","affiliation":["Mechatronic Engineering Department, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Jie","id":"37086987014"},{"name":"Bian Xin-qian","affiliation":["Power and Nuclear Engineering College, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Bian Xin-qian","id":"37087766849"},{"name":"Shi Xiao-cheng","affiliation":["Power and Nuclear Engineering College, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Shi Xiao-cheng","id":"37088034512"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9044-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"1626663","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626663","abstract":"In allusion to the problem of global path planning for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) on an environment of large-scale chart data, an improved adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is proposed in this paper.

This is to adjust the kinematic parameters in the robot controller model to the actual robot parameters which differ from the nominal values due to e.g. manufacturing errors or thermal effects. Usually redundant measurement which is required for calibration is obtained by external measurement devices. Parallel robots offer the opportunity to perform a more elegant calibration by means of sensors placed in the passive joints. This approach which offers several advantages compared to conventional calibration is known as self-calibration since the passive joint sensors are part of the robot system itself. This paper presents a technique for self-calibration of the HEXA-parallel-structure. Due to consequent utilization of the passive joint sensors the approach works computationally more efficient than others. Particular problems arising during the calibration process are addressed and corresponding solutions are proposed. Finally calibration success is demonstrated by means of simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626741","startPage":"1300","endPage":"1305 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10831/34148/01626741.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HEXA-parallel-structure calibration by means of angular passive joint sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Robot sensing systems","Parallel robots","Sensor systems","Robotics and automation","Kinematics","Robot control","Educational robots","Computational geometry","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot kinematics","calibration","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEXA-parallel-structure self-calibration","angular passive joint sensors","geometric calibration","robotic structure absolute accuracy","kinematic parameters","robot controller model","redundant measurement","external measurement devices","parallel robots"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","displayDocTitle":"HEXA-parallel-structure calibration by means of angular passive joint sensors","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1626741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8939261","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HEXA-parallel-structure calibration by means of angular passive joint sensors","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048971S","chronDate":"2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34148","articleId":"1626741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1626747,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

To ensure system's robustness and closed loop stability and to improve the performance of the controller, the RBF based adaptive inverse control is combined with a closed loop PID controller. Experimental results are provided for various types of trajectories, comparing the performance of the proposed controller to the same neuro-controller using feed forward back-propagation neural networks (FFBP) proposed previously by the authors. The results show the superior performance of RBFNN over FFBP neural networks. Also the comparison of neuro controllers with a conventional fixed gain stand-alone PID controller show the improvement of the controller performance from 80% up to 99.7% decrease in the mean squared error (MSE) for different trajectories. Trajectories were tracked with the maximum error of 0.02 up to 0.06 degrees. Also the robustness of the method is confirmed through experimental results comparing neuro-controllers and the conventional PID controller by varying the load's inertia and disturbance torques. For this purpose two methods were examined. First using the same neuro-controllers trained by the initial training data and in the second method, neuro-controllers were adapted by new training data according to the new working conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626747","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1339 Vol. 3","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34148","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10831/34148/01626747.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive inverse microstep tracking control of a hybrid stepper motor using RBF and MLP neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626747/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive inverse microstep tracking control of a hybrid stepper motor using RBF and MLP neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1626747/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8946957","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive inverse microstep tracking control of a hybrid stepper motor using RBF and MLP neural networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043246S","chronDate":"2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","xplore-issue":"34148","articleId":"1626747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1626768,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Jian'an","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Xu Jian'an","id":"37087564350"},{"name":"Zhang Mingjun","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Mingjun","id":"37087293708"},{"name":"Zhang Jian","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Jian","id":"37087523598"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9044-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"1626768","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626768","abstract":"The kinematic model identification algorithm of the autonomous mobile robot using dynamical recurrent neural network is presented.

The position and velocity kinematic modelings have been performed in details afterwards. In view of the physical constraints imposed by piezoelectric actuators and flexure hinges, the CPM's workspace range is determined analytically. Particularly, it is illustrated that the CPM possesses a fairly regular like workspace with a maximum cuboid defined as usable workspace inscribed and one isotropic configuration involved. Furthermore, the architecture design of the CPM with the goal of achieving a maximum usable workspace is carried out, and the dexterity performance over the workspace has been verified. Simulation results reveal that the compact CPM can perform a high dexterous manipulation within the usable workspace.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10831/34148/01626790.pdf","startPage":"1575","endPage":"1580 Vol. 3","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel design of a 3-PUU spatial compliant parallel micromanipulator for nanomanipulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Micromanipulators","Atomic force microscopy","Kinematics","Fasteners","Nanotechnology","Nanoscale devices","Force feedback","Manipulators","Manufacturing","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micromanipulators","compliance control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanomanipulation","three-prismatic-universal-universal spatial compliant parallel micromanipulator","flexure joints","pseudo-rigid-body model","piezoelectric actuators","flexure hinges","maximum cuboid","isotropic configuration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","displayDocTitle":"Novel design of a 3-PUU spatial compliant parallel micromanipulator for nanomanipulation","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1626790/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8939277","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel design of a 3-PUU spatial compliant parallel micromanipulator for nanomanipulation","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051524S","chronDate":"2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34148","articleId":"1626790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1626798,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Fan Ng","id":"37296950700"},{"name":"Juite Hwu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Juite Hwu","id":"37628893200"},{"name":"Mo Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Mo Chen","id":"37407031000"},{"name":"Xiaohua Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaohua Li","id":"37280865500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9044-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"1626798","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Robot sensing systems","Orbital robotics","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor arrays","Frequency synchronization","Transmitters","Spread spectrum communication","Energy efficiency","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","robots","space-time codes","linear predictive coding","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic networks","asynchronous space-time cooperative communications","wireless sensor networks","space-time block code","asynchronous transmitting sensors","linear-prediction-based channel equalization technique"]}],"abstract":"For wireless sensor networks or robotic networks, cooperative communications encoded with space-time block code (STBC) are desirable to improve their energy efficiency and reliability. However, existing STBC-encoded cooperative communication schemes usually require perfect synchronization among the transmitting sensors or robots, which is difficult and even impossible to achieve in practice. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a new receiving scheme for Alamouti's STBC cooperative transmission where two asynchronous transmitting sensors or robots are employed. The new scheme uses a linear-prediction-based channel equalization technique to mitigate the effect of asynchronism. The performance of the new scheme is analyzed and demonstrated by simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous space-time cooperative communications in sensor and robotic networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626798","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10831/34148/01626798.pdf","startPage":"1624","endPage":"1629 Vol. 3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous space-time cooperative communications in sensor and robotic networks","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1626798/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8939285","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous space-time cooperative communications in sensor and robotic networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042984S","chronDate":"2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"34148","articleId":"1626798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1626803,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

An early control methodology for time delayed systems, which is applicable to teleoperation systems is the use of Smith predictors. Recently a few Smith predictor based teleoperation control architectures have been proposed for 2-channel teleoperation systems in which the linear dynamics of the slave or environment are mapped at the master. This paper discusses the effectiveness of this control structure for 2-channel force-position teleoperation when applied to the nonlinear time varying dynamics of slave and environment. The proposed nonlinear predictive controller and its variations use neural networks to online estimate the dynamics of the slave and environment allowing replication of the environment contact force at the master using a similar network. The performance of the proposed architectures are evaluated on a teleoperation test-bed consisting of two planar twin-pantograph haptic devices.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626803","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1659 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10831/34148/01626803.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based teleoperation using Smith predictors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Communication system control","Control systems","Master-slave","Force control","Communication channels","Uncertainty","Delay systems","Delay effects","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurocontrollers","predictive control","telecontrol","delays","time-varying systems","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network-based teleoperation system","Smith predictors","communication channel tune delay","environment dynamic uncertainties","bilateral teleoperation controllers","time delayed systems","linear dynamics","2-channel force-position teleoperation","nonlinear predictive controller","planar twin-pantograph haptic devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based teleoperation using Smith predictors","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1626803/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8939290","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based teleoperation using Smith predictors","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062307S","chronDate":"2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"34148","articleId":"1626803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1626813,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyi Zhang","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China","Henan Science and Technology University, Luoyang, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Hongyi Zhang","id":"37087172520"},{"name":"Jiexin Pu","affiliation":["Department of Control Science & Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Jiexin Pu","id":"37087220750"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9044-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"1626813","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Clustering algorithms","Gene expression","Shape","Noise robustness","Brightness","Testing","Noise shaping","Image processing","Fluorescence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","neural nets","data analysis","pattern clustering","genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gene expression data clustering","pulse coupled neural network","nonGaussian distribution","parameter selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626813","abstract":"We describe a new approach to the clustering analysis of gene expression data using pulse coupled neural network (PCNN).

In order to adequately make use of all kinds of remote sensing images information such as SPOT Panchromatic and three-band Landsat multi-spectral images, a novel remote sensing image fusion scheme based on average gradient of wavelet transform is proposed. In the fusion processing, the fused approximate coefficients are obtained with weighted average method. For the bigger average gradient of the each decomposed approximate coefficient, we choose a big power gene. The other approximate coefficient chooses a small one. The fused detailed coefficients are obtained by setting each coefficient equal to the corresponding input image wavelet coefficient that has the greatest average gradient. The information entropy and the image clarity are proposed as the quantitative evaluation criteria to assess this proposed method and some other methods.

Neural networks (NN) is capable of monitoring unset of faults, however, complexity of the many possible failure modes and various levels of intensity may deteriorate the accuracy of NN. This paper presents malleable neural networks architecture for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of a subsystem of a machining centre. A central NN is trained with faulty status of operation at the core stage which is then able to discern between healthy and all possible faulty states. NNs are then modulated to learn each failure mode with their different intensity levels. Diagnostic is initially made by the central module, then, the network is reconfigured by an interprocess call to adapt to an appropriate topology and knowledgebase to detect the severity level of the fault. The monitoring system uses steady state values of sensitive parameters of current and pressure transducers. If the parameters are out of a predefined healthy range, a nondestructive test will be initiated, which produces a transient response as input pattern to the NNs. Testing the NN based monitoring system with 395 failure modes showed that in 99.2% of cases the network was successful to accurately identify the cause and severity of the failures.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626856","pdfPath":"/iel5/10831/34149/01626856.pdf","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1928 Vol. 4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Malleable neural networks in fault detection of complex systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Malleable neural networks in fault detection of complex systems","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","accessionNumber":"8939340","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1626856/","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Malleable neural networks in fault detection of complex systems","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09139S","chronDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34149","articleId":"1626856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1626867,"authors":[{"name":"Lunwei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lunwei Zhang","id":"37087303670"},{"name":"Jinwu Qian","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jinwu Qian","id":"37087303829"},{"name":"Yanan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yanan Zhang","id":"37087397811"},{"name":"Linyong Shen","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Linyong Shen","id":"37087303547"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9044-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"1626867","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":526},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On SDM/WDM FBG sensor net for shape detection of endoscope","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626867","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Shape","Endoscopes","Fiber gratings","Bragg gratings","Biosensors","Wire","Biopsy","Biomedical signal processing","Software systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical signal processing","fibre optic sensors","Bragg gratings","wavelength division multiplexing","endoscopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colonoscope shape detection","endoscope","fiber Bragg grating sensor","spatial division multiplex sensing network","wavelength division multiplex sensing network","biopsy channel","signal processing system"]}],"abstract":"A novel slim FBG (fiber Bragg grating) sensor wire and its application in real-time dynamic shape detection of colonoscopes are presented.

However, the desired process output set used for prediction may not necessarily be realistic to the process. Consequently the prediction will be inaccurate due to anomalies in the prediction input data. With developing processes it is often unknown whether a set of data presented for prediction is feasible or not until the prediction results are applied to the process. This paper presents a method using feedforward backpropagation neural networks to firstly adjust the data presented for prediction to be realistic to the process and secondly, to implement an iterative process to quickly converge to a prediction. The innovation is in the iterations being processed through a combination of separate backwards and forwards neural networks. By implementing this prediction method, expensive and time consuming process verification runs can be reduced through improved accuracy of desktop studies.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626877","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2048 Vol. 4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10831/34149/01626877.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference Mechatronics and Automation, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based iterative prediction of multivariable processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Forward contracts","Iterative methods","Manufacturing processes","Backpropagation","Feedforward neural networks","Technological innovation","Prediction methods","Acceleration","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","multivariable systems","backpropagation","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based iterative prediction","multivariable process","multivariable systems","process output set","prediction input data","feedforward backpropagation neural networks","backward neural networks","forward neural networks","process verification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based iterative prediction of multivariable processes","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1626877/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8939361","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based iterative prediction of multivariable processes","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01626877.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053051S","chronDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10831","isNumber":"34149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10831","xplore-issue":"34149","articleId":"1626877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1626888,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhang Ding","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yuhang Ding","id":"37087304335"},{"name":"Dayan Zhuang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Dayan Zhuang","id":"37087303437"},{"name":"Kejun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Kejun Wang","id":"37087304395"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9044-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"1626888","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1076},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Veins","Fingerprint recognition","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Humans","Authentication","Image recognition","Character recognition","Automation","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","feature extraction","image thinning","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand vein recognition","threshold segmentation","conditional thinning method","image feature extraction","feature matching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626888","abstract":"In this paper, the theoretical foundation and difficulties of hand vein recognition are introduced at first.

In this paper, we formulate the delivery ratio prediction problem as a classification problem (predicting link to be \"good\" or \"bad), and apply various statistical classification algorithms (k-NN, kernel methods, and support vector machines) to it. We obtain the temporal data of link delivery ratios and SNR's from a measurement trace of a live wireless mesh network, and analyze the effectiveness of using SNR to enhance delivery ratio classification. Contrary to the pessimistic conclusion of previous works, we find that by incorporating SNR information in addition to historical delivery ratio data, the classification accuracy is improved in all the algorithms we used, with an average reduction of 8-10% of errors compared with using delivery ratio data alone. We therefore conclude that adding SNR can be an attractive alternative when designing a wireless link delivery ratio prediction protocol","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2005.1626960","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/10832/34150/01626960.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2005.1626960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving wireless link delivery ratio classification with packet SNR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1626960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1626960/","displayDocTitle":"Improving wireless link delivery ratio classification with packet SNR","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9036968","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1626960/","conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving wireless link delivery ratio classification with packet SNR","confLoc":"Lincoln, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"01626960.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08132S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10832","isNumber":"34150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10832","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"34150","articleId":"1626960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1626964,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Liang Dong","id":"37401031400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9232-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"1626964","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Array signal processing","Fading","Downlink","Rayleigh channels","Frequency","Covariance matrix","Antenna arrays","Mobile antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile antennas","mobile communication","ray tracing","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust beamforming","frequency-division duplex mobile systems","Rayleigh fading channels","mobile wireless systems","downlink beamforming weights","base antennas","uplink signal subspace","downlink transmission","multiple diversity branches","signal subspace stability","fast Rayleigh fading","uplink subspace","downlink subspace","open-loop beamforming","ray tracing simulations"]}],"abstract":"A beamforming approach is developed for mobile wireless systems operated in vehicular scenarios such that the channel undergoes fast Rayleigh fading.

Compared with most existing semiblind/blind detectors, the proposed framework requires a minimum number of previously received signals, which is about the number of interfering signals, and no detection filter converging or sub-space separation procedure. The computational complexity and detection delay are therefore much lower. In this framework, a semiblind multiuser signal model is used instead of the widely-discussed conventional multiuser model or subspace-based parametric multiuser signal model. Following this framework, two optimal semiblind linear detectors are developed using the minimum variance unbiased estimation (MVU) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation criteria. Meanwhile, a multi-window scheme is proposed for simultaneously detecting several bits and a recursively adaptive procedure is developed for further lowering the complexity. After these, the asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) of the proposed framework, the comparison between the employed semiblind multiuser signal model and the conventional signal model, and several estimation bounds are discussed.

In this paper we present a simple Neural Network (NN) based approach to KF tuning problem. Since the approach trades number of KF runs required for the optimal filter tuning for KF performance, the result of the such tuning is the set of tuning parameters that gives suboptimal performance. Advantages of this approach are: 1) simple practical framework for optimal filter performance tuning, 2) the framework is independent of the type of a filter and 3) low number of filter runs required to obtain quasi optimal parameter set. The main disadvantage is the suboptimal filter performance that can be easily improved by increasing the number of filter runs. Two NN architectures were investigated, generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and regular radial basis networks (RBNN). RBNN showed much better performance for a given non-linear test function with a clear maximum peak. Performance measures along with computational efficiency for these methods were compared.

Price forecasting is a new research area, because power market is still in the rudimentary stage in China. Due to its attractive properties of learning convergence and speed, many practical areas have widely put it into use including power system marginal price forecasting area. The method of neural network is good at its learning capability but lack of clear internal knowledge expression. The beginning of study is limited to random initial conditions, which may lead to low convergence speed and even local extremum. Necessary initial experience and knowledge cannot be fully made use of. While fuzzy logic method is good at approximate and qualitative knowledge expression but lack of learning capability. Membership function and fuzzy rules can only be selected by experience and tries. Besides, the study and adjustment of parameters and weigh is rather difficult. Thus, the proper combination of the above methods is a breakthrough in effective system control. This paper establishes a short-term forecasting model of power system marginal price using the method of cerebellar model articulation controller neural network, and applies it to power market in real province for training and examining. FCMAC method is proved to be superior to former methods, for its low need of training samples, its stable outputs, its high forecasted speed and accuracy. This method provides power companies with a reliable support in making and implementing their bidding strategies.","doi":"10.1109/IPEC.2005.206878","startPage":"1","endPage":"57","publicationTitle":"2005 International Power Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEC.2005.206878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34152","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Power Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10834/34152/01627167.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of new FCMAC neural network in power system marginal price forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1627167/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of new FCMAC neural network in power system marginal price forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1627167/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9055183","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2005-Dec. 2 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of new FCMAC neural network in power system marginal price forecasting","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01627167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068101S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2005-Dec. 2 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10834","isNumber":"34152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10834","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"34152","articleId":"1627167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IPEC Organising Committee","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1627170,"authors":[{"name":"N.

To design and build a prototype outdoor compact substation to withstand internal arc fault and meet all criterion, it needs to predict the arc pressure due to internal arc fault for construction of compact substation. This paper assesses internal arc pressure due to vaporized metal of compact substation in the arc process. Voltage drop of arc is evaluated in order to calculate arc pressure and the value is 22-25 V/cm.

MW power flow tracing was invented to assess the extent of network usage. MW power tracing, a post-facto analysis of power flow solution, is amenable to multiple solutions. This implies multiplicity of solution space of cost allocation problem. Existing tracing methods enforce a `proportionate sharing rule' to solve the dilemma. Case studies indicate that with such a sharing rule, extent of network usage predicted for large and distant loads can be much higher than the postage stamp allocation. To alleviate this problem, we propose a tracing compliant modified postage stamp allocation method which computes a traceable solution that minimizes deviation from the postage stamp allocation. We show that tracing problem can be formulated as a linear constrained optimization problem. Thus, fairness among all network users is ascertained. Results on actual data of central transmission utility of Western Regional Grid of India demonstrate the claims","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1627181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2005-Dec. 2 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1627181/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9055195","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Allocation of fixed transmission costs by tracing compliant postage stamp method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation of fixed transmission costs by tracing compliant postage stamp method","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01627181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105225S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2005-Dec. 2 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10834","isNumber":"34152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10834","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34152","articleId":"1627181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IPEC Organising Committee","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1627187,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper presents a new approach for classifying transient phenomena in power transformers, which may be implemented in digital relaying for transformer differential protection. Discrimination among different operating conditions (normal, inrush, over excitation, CT saturation and internal fault) of the power transformer is achieved by combining wavelet transform with neural network. The wavelet transform is applied for the analysis of power transformer transient phenomena, because of its ability to extract information from the transient signal simultaneously in both time and frequency domain. Neural network is used because of its self-learning and highly nonlinear mapping capability. The proposed scheme has been realized through two different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (one is used as an internal fault detector (IFD) and another one is used as a condition monitor (CM)). These two ANN architectures were trained using BPN (back propagation algorithm) alone, and combining BPN with wavelet transforms (WNN), so that it should recognize and classify all the above operating conditions and faults. The simulation results obtained shows that the new algorithm accurately provides high operating sensitivity for internal faults and remains stable for other operating conditions of the power transformer. From that it was inferred that the combined WNN provides more accurate results and it has high-speed response and increased ability to discriminate even low-level fault signals from other operating conditions","doi":"10.1109/IPEC.2005.206898","publicationTitle":"2005 International Power Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Power Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10834/34152/01627187.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEC.2005.206898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34152","startPage":"1","endPage":"1576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for power transformer protection based upon combined wavelet transform and neural networks (WNN)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1627187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for power transformer protection based upon combined wavelet transform and neural networks (WNN)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2005-Dec. 2 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1627187/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9055200","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1627187/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for power transformer protection based upon combined wavelet transform and neural networks (WNN)","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01627187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059159S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2005-Dec. 2 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10834","isNumber":"34152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10834","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34152","articleId":"1627187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IPEC Organising Committee","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1627189,"authors":[{"name":"Z.Y.

This paper presents a novel fuzzy-rough sets based ANN for STLF. The fuzzy-rough sets theory is first employed to perform input selection and determine the initial weights of ANN. In the sequel, an improved k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method is used for the selection of similar days in history as the training set of ANN.

A microgrid consists of a combination of generation sources, loads and energy storage interfaced through fast acting power electronics. The aim of operating microgrid sub-systems is to move away from considering DG as badly behaved system components, of which a limited amount can be tolerated in an area, to 'good citizens'. The paper is focused on the development of a novel energy management system (EMS) based on the application of neural networks (NN). The EMS is able to autonomously make decisions and determine hour by hour the correct dispatch of generators with the final goal of minimising the global energy costs. The application of the EMS to a small test case has showed significant saves in the global energy bill by using typical Italian energy and fuel price data","doi":"10.1109/IPEC.2005.206991","publicationTitle":"2005 International Power Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Power Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10834/34152/01627280.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"668 Vol. 2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEC.2005.206991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal participation of a microgrid to the energy market with an intelligent EMS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1627280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2005-Dec. 2 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1627280/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal participation of a microgrid to the energy market with an intelligent EMS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9110449","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1627280/","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal participation of a microgrid to the energy market with an intelligent EMS","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01627280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064239S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2005-Dec. 2 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10834","isNumber":"34152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10834","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"34152","articleId":"1627280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IPEC Organising Committee","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1627281,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Such advantages can be achieved if the relevant concerns are deliberately taken into account. In practice, the introduction of DG may lead to problems of protection coordination. In addition, the operating ranges of protective devices should also be considered. The degree of the problem tends to increase when several DG sources are installed in the system. This paper has analyzed and derived a set of equations to represent such protection coordination and operating range constraints. The result can be used to determine the sizes of DG sources while the existing protection scheme can be maintained.

excitation control scheme has been proposed based on transient energy function and backstepping design method, which can not only compensate the damping coefficient of generator directly, but also guarantee asymptotical stability of the designed control system. For a SMIB (single-machine-infinite-bus) system, from the view of adding damping and enhancing system stability, an extra damping term is introduced into the motion equation, and then the designed system can be viewed as a series of two dynamic equation sets. Based on backstepping method, a transient energy function is constructed and the corresponding nonlinear excitation control law is deduced. In this control law, only two parameters are chosen, i.e. the expected damping coefficient increment and the expected voltage feedback gain. Executable approximations of the controller are also discussed.

The PSO using different rules and GA are simulated for data association in the presence of fault alarms, and missed detections.

However, it has been observed that the standard PSO algorithm has premature and local convergence phenomenon when solving complex optimization problem. To resolve this problem an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is proposed in this paper. This new algorithm introduces mutation operator with adaptive mutation probability into the PSO algorithm; meanwhile it replaces those particles that fly out the solution space with new generated random particles during the searching process. Through testing two benchmark functions with large dimensionality, the experimental results show the new method enhances the global optimization ability greatly, and avoids the premature convergence problem effectively.

The sampling is not required to be periodic, and the only assumption is that the distance between any two consecutive sampling instants is less than a given bound. By using the input delay approach, the T-S fuzzy system with variable uncertain sampling is transformed into a continuous-time T-S fuzzy system with a delay in the state. A new condition guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the closed-loop sampled-data system is derived by a Lyapunov approach plus the free weighting matrix technique. Based on this stability condition, two procedures for designing state-feedback control laws are given: one casts the controller design into a convex optimization by introducing some over design, and the other utilizes the cone complementarity linearization (CCL) idea to cast the controller design into a sequential minimization problem subject to linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, which can be readily solved using standard numerical software.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCAA.2006.1627630","publicationTitle":"2006 1st International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aerospace and Astronautics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 1st International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aerospace and Astronautics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10835/34153/01627630.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","endPage":"300","doi":"10.1109/ISSCAA.2006.1627630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilization of sampled-data T-S fuzzy systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Stabilization of sampled-data T-S fuzzy systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Jan. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1627630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9005101","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1627630/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilization of sampled-data T-S fuzzy systems","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"01627630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051074S","chronDate":"19-21 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10835","isNumber":"34153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10835","xplore-issue":"34153","articleId":"1627630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1627633,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wang","affiliation":["Naval Aeronautical Engineering Institute, Yantai, China"],"lastName":"Bo Wang","id":"37087213185"},{"name":"GuoQiang Liang","affiliation":["Naval Aeronautical Engineering Institute, Yantai, China"],"lastName":"GuoQiang Liang","id":"37087581329"},{"name":"ChanLin Wang","affiliation":["Naval Aeronautical Engineering Institute, Yantai, China"],"lastName":"ChanLin Wang","id":"37087580792"},{"name":"YunLong Dong","affiliation":["Naval Aeronaut.

Microparticles with different sizes can be successfully separated at different stages of squeezed sheath flows. Separated microparticles then flow into expansion channel blocks to enlarge the distance of the separated flow streams and are collected at different side channels. Only one high voltage is required for generating all the sheath flows for particle separation by applying a series of variable resister to create different electric field levels such that the system is simple and reliable. This study also adopts numerical simulation to analyze and predict the flow fields and stream lines within the microchannel. Experimental results show that the microchip is capable of continuously separating microparticles with the sizes of 5, 10 and 20 \u03bcm using the proposed squeeze-jumping effect. The method proposed in this study provides a simple way to continuously separate microparticles/cells with different sizes.

Because this tactile sensor can measure the variations of resistance of the semiconductor strain gauge for normal and shear force, it can be used to sense touch, pressure, hardness, and slip.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34154","startPage":"678","endPage":"681","displayPublicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10836/34154/01627890.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-Axes Flexible Tactile Sensor Fabricated by Si Micromachining and Packaging Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1627890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1627890/","displayDocTitle":"3-Axes Flexible Tactile Sensor Fabricated by Si Micromachining and Packaging Technology","conferenceDate":"22-26 Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-Axes Flexible Tactile Sensor Fabricated by Si Micromachining and Packaging Technology","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"01627890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088748S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10836","isNumber":"34154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10836","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"34154","articleId":"1627890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1627898,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Two innovations are presented. The first is the complete migration of control and demodulation tasks to the digital domain. For this purpose, interfacing circuits based on \u03a3\u0394 techniques are introduced for both primary and secondary mode. The advantage is that complex analog electronics for tracking the resonant frequency, stabilizing the amplitude of the primary mode oscillation and phase-sensitive demodulation can be replaced by their digital counterpart. A second innovation relates to the \u03a3\u0394 force-feedback loop. In previously reported structures a compensation filter is introduced for stabilizing the loop [ 1\u2013 3]. Unfortunately, the compensation filter introduces extra poles and influences the noise-shaping characteristic, which makes the loop difficult to design and optimize. We demonstrate the possibility of obtaining a stable \u03a3\u0394 force-feedback loop without an explicit compensation filter.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627898","displayPublicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10836/34154/01627898.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627898","publicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","startPage":"710","endPage":"713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digitally Controlled MEMS Gyroscope With Unconstrained Sigma-Delta Force-Feedback Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1627898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"A Digitally Controlled MEMS Gyroscope With Unconstrained Sigma-Delta Force-Feedback Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1627898/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1627898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"22-26 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digitally Controlled MEMS Gyroscope With Unconstrained Sigma-Delta Force-Feedback Architecture","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"01627898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035327S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10836","isNumber":"34154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10836","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"34154","articleId":"1627898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1627900,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Multiple antennas are used to achieve spatial diversity and these antenna elements must be separated properly to have uncorrelated communication signals. The separation can be on the scale of a symbol wavelength ([speed of light]/[symbol rate]). We have designed a printed circular disc monopole and measured the UWB radio channel. Finally, we used the measurements to show the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) performance gain which occurs when the receiver antennas are separated on the scale of a symbol wavelength.","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2006.51","publicationTitle":"4th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (CNSR'06)","startPage":"5 pp.","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2006.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34156","pdfPath":"/iel5/10838/34156/01628103.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"4th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (CNSR'06)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Antenna measurements","Ultra wideband technology","MIMO","Wavelength measurement","Ultra wideband antennas","FCC","Bandwidth","Baseband","Pulse modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband antennas","least mean squares methods","MIMO systems","diversity reception","microstrip antenna arrays","monopole antenna arrays","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband technology","multiantenna UWB system","minimum mean squared error","symbol-wavelength MMSE","multiple input multiple output technique","MIMO system","spatial diversity","printed circular disc monopole","radio channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","adaptive equalizers","antenna measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Symbol-wavelength MMSE gain in a multi-antenna UWB system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628103/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1628103/","accessionNumber":"9074655","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"24-25 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 May 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-wavelength MMSE gain in a multi-antenna UWB system","confLoc":"Moncton, NB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01628103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062088S","chronDate":"24-25 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10838","isNumber":"34156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10838","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34156","articleId":"1628103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1628104,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37422496000"},{"name":"J.

Specifically, the input and output of the nonlinear HPA are accessed in the feedback loop structure to obtain the Volterra kernel parameters using least mean square (LMS) and recursive least square (RLS) algorithms. Once the Volterra kernel is obtained and signals pass through the cascaded system of the predistorter and the HPA, overall linear system characteristics are achieved. The proposed method is non-parametric as it does not assume any specific model for the HPA and the signal structure. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified through computer simulations.

The time measurement architecture is standalone and occupies a small silicon area, 150mum by 180mum, making it attractive for high resolution on-chip time measurement","doi":"10.1109/ETS.2006.36","publicationTitle":"Eleventh IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eleventh IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10839/34157/01628161.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2006.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Chip Time Measurement Architecture with Femtosecond Timing Resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1628161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628161/","displayDocTitle":"On-Chip Time Measurement Architecture with Femtosecond Timing Resolution","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9074635","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1628161/","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Chip Time Measurement Architecture with Femtosecond Timing Resolution","confLoc":"Southampton, UK","sourcePdf":"01628161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06945S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10839","isNumber":"34157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10839","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34157","articleId":"1628161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1628182,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The IEEE 802.11 standard has been used widely in most commercial WLAN products available in the market because it proved its efficiency. Development of QoS techniques to provide an effective resources management and a fast access to the network is required. Many solutions were proposed, but most of those solutions are focused on only the MAC layer. In this study, we make further study and evaluations of AMCLM, a new 802.11 WLANs QoS management solution. The originality of this approach is the utilization of a Cross-Layer solution which takes advantage from PHY layer state expressed in SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) to improve the global throughput of the whole network.

However a measure of channel state is desired in order to decide upon transition to these rates. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S1NR) is such a measure and an estimator operating in low transmission rates, such as BPSK or using the preamble data would be proper. In this work two online SNR estimators are developed for OFDM systems, operating on BPSK modulation or on the preamble data. It is shown that the convergence of the algorithms to the actual SNR value is achieved from about 0 dBs or even lower. The impact of the channel estimation used on the SNR estimation accuracy is given and improvements, regarding the computational cost, on one of them are given. Finally a transmission procedure for an OFDM modem using these SNR estimators is given.","doi":"10.1109/ICNICONSMCL.2006.198","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Networking, International Conference on Systems and International Conference on Mobile Communications and Learning Technologies (ICNICONSMCL'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Networking, International Conference on Systems and International Conference on Mobile Communications and Learning Technologies (ICNICONSMCL'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10841/34159/01628443.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNICONSMCL.2006.198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34159","startPage":"198","endPage":"198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SNR Estimation for Low Bit Rate OFDM Systems in AWGN Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1628443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SNR Estimation for Low Bit Rate OFDM Systems in AWGN Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628443/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 April 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1628443/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SNR Estimation for Low Bit Rate OFDM Systems in AWGN Channel","confLoc":"Morne, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"01628443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081295S","chronDate":"23-29 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10841","isNumber":"34159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10841","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"34159","articleId":"1628443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1628450,"authors":[{"name":"Qihong Ge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engr., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qihong Ge","id":"37984526400"},{"name":"Huazhong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engr., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Huazhong Yang","id":"37291236500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2552-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1628450","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Fourier transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Noise reduction","Fading","Digital video broadcasting","AWGN","Computational modeling","Digital audio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Noise-resilient","channel estimation","Hadamard transform","OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise-resilient","channel estimation","Hadamard transform","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Cyclically extended guard interval in OFDM systems turns the traditional time-domain equalization into simple frequency-domain equalization, but channel noise deteriorates the accuracy of channel estimation, thus degrading the performance of equalization. By incorporating with two-dimensional Hadamard Transform, a noise-resilient channel estimation algorithm is proposed. Energy of the channel is concentrated with two-dimensional Hadamard Transform, and noise is reduced in the transform domain.

We model a note signal as a periodic signal with (slow) global variation of amplitude (reflecting attack, sustain, decay) and frequency (limited time warping). Also voiced speech admits such a representation. The bandlimited variation of global amplitude and frequency gets expressed through a subsampled representation and parameterization of the corresponding signals. The periodic signal is assumed to arrive at a set of sensors with different amplitude and delay. Assuming additive white Gaussian noise, a maximum likelihood approach is proposed for the estimation of the model parameters and the optimization is performed in an iterative (cyclic) fashion that leads to a sequence of simple least-squares problems. Particular attention is paid to the estimation of the basic periodic signal, which can have a non-integer period.

Simulation results show an improved performance of the proposed beam-former compared to earlier wideband robust beamforming techniques","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2005.1628604","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/SP 13th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10843/34164/01628604.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2005.1628604","publicationTitle":"IEEE/SP 13th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, 2005","startPage":"265","endPage":"270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband robust beamforming based on worst-case performance optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1628604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Wideband robust beamforming based on worst-case performance optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628604/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9131882","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"17-20 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband robust beamforming based on worst-case performance optimization","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"01628604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041823S","chronDate":"17-20 July 2005","isNumber":"34164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10843","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1628604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1628605,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We also demonstrate this condition on a CDMA system with a single RAKE finger. Results are applicable both for CDMA and for impulse radio (IR) systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/SP 13th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10843/34164/01628752.pdf","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1065","publicationTitle":"IEEE/SP 13th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, 2005","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2005.1628752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2005.1628752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1628752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of Probability Control in CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Interference","Optimal control","Cause effect analysis","Upper bound","Bit error rate","Signal analysis","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","probability","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA systems","probability control","interference","transmission probability","signal-to-noise plus interference ratio","SIR","single RAKE finger","impulse radio","noncontinuous transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"The use of Probability Control in CDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9122947","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","conferenceDate":"17-20 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of Probability Control in CDMA systems","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"01628752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037878S","chronDate":"17-20 July 2005","isNumber":"34164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10843","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1628752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1628753,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The PIC technique consists of first estimating the interference by decoding all the non-desired users with a conventional correlation receiver (CCR), and then of removing the estimated interference from the received signal in order to detect the desired user. We study an improvement of this technique: PIC+HL, in which we use an hard limiter (HL) before the CCR of the desired user, in order to limit the interference term due to the non-desired users bad cancellation.

These matrices are usually estimates of some underlying matrices which admit exact joint diagonalization (EJD) in a noiseless scenario. When additive noise is present, the underlying set no longer admits EJD, since an unknown noise-related matrix is usually added to the diagonalizable form. Often this noise-related matrix is known to be diagonal. Hence, we define the \"approximate joint biagonalization\" (AJB) problem, aimed at fitting the noisy model to the estimated set of matrices. AJB differs from AJD in the presence of an additional unknown diagonal matrix in the model.

In this work, we propose a novel communication architecture for a canonical decentralized detection problem where the sensor nodes exchange continuously their local decisions until consensus is reached among all nodes. Our methodology capitalizes on the observation that the information embedded in the exchanged messages decreases to zero as the decisions gradually converge. By using a data-driven multiple access scheme, we show that the number of channel accesses required for each round of message exchange decreases, following the same trend as the aggregate entropy of the sensor decisions.

The method exploits the particular structure, occurring when the ST sequence period is larger than the channel length, of the vector containing the received signal's first-order cyclostationary statistics. After synchronisation, any DC-offset can be removed and an unbiased channel estimate can be obtained. Necessary and sufficient conditions for synchronisation are provided. The problem of training sequence design for an improved synchronisation is also addressed. An expression for the variance of the channel estimate is obtained as well, assuming perfect synchronisation and using the designed training sequences. The proposed synchronisation method is computationally more efficient than existing methods, and yet its performance, in term of channel estimation MSE and BER, is not diminished as shown by simulations","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2005.1628801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34164","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1329","pdfPath":"/iel5/10843/34164/01628801.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/SP 13th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/SP 13th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2005.1628801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved synchronisation for superimposed training based channel estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Bandwidth","Higher order statistics","Cities and towns","Sufficient conditions","Bit error rate","Data mining","Radio frequency","Speech synthesis","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","mean square error methods","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","superimposed training","channel estimation","first-order cyclostationary statistics","training sequences","MSE","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Improved synchronisation for superimposed training based channel estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628801/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9122991","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"17-20 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved synchronisation for superimposed training based channel estimation","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"01628801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032553S","chronDate":"17-20 July 2005","isNumber":"34164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10843","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1628801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1628802,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

Optimal methods of scoring biomarkers and identifying candidate hits have been actively studied in academia and industry, with the exception of data modeling topics. To find candidate hits, we need to score the images associated with different compound interventions. In the application example of RNAi genome-wide screening, we aim to find the candidate effectors or genes which correspond to the images acquired using the three channels. Scoring the effectors is equivalent to scoring the images based on the number of phenotypes existing in those images. Our ultimate objective of studying HTS is to model the relationship between gene networks and cellular phenotypes, investigate cellular communication via protein interaction, and study the disease mechanism beyond the prediction based on the molecular structure of the compound. Finally, computational image analysis has become a powerful tool in cellular and molecular biology studies. Signal processing and modeling for high-throughput image screening is an emerging filed that requires novel algorithms for dynamical system analysis, image processing, and statistical modeling.

An implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-4 XC4VLX100-12 FPGA occupies 1,452 slices, three block RAMs, and 12 DSP slices, and is capable of generating 750 million samples per second at a clock speed of 375 MHz. The performance can be improved by exploiting concurrent execution: 37 parallel instances of the noise generator at 95 MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC2VP100-7 FPGA generate seven billion samples per second and can run over 200 times faster than the output produced by software running on an Intel Pentium-4 3 GHz PC. The noise generator is currently being used at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA to evaluate the performance of low-density parity-check codes for deep-space communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise generators","Field programmable gate arrays","Random number generation","Approximation methods","Error analysis","Optimization methods","Clocks","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","digital simulation","error analysis","field programmable gate arrays","fixed point arithmetic","function approximation","Gaussian processes","noise generators","optimisation","parity check codes","random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware Gaussian noise generator","Box-Muller method","error analysis","noise samples","hardware-based simulation system","channel code behavior","bit error rates","bit-width optimization","fixed point arithmetic","clock cycle","Xilinx Virtex-4 XC4VLX100-12 FPGA","RAM","DSP slices","Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC2VP100-7 FPGA","Intel Pentium-4 3 GHz PC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms implemented in hardware","computer arithmetic","error analysis","elementary function approximation","field programmable gate arrays","minimax approximation and algorithms","optimization","random number generation","simulation."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1628955","doi":"10.1109/TC.2006.81","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/34169/01628955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.81","startPage":"659","endPage":"671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware Gaussian noise generator using the Box-Muller method and its error analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hardware Gaussian noise generator using the Box-Muller method and its error analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628955/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1628955/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8951642","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware Gaussian noise generator using the Box-Muller method and its error analysis","sourcePdf":"01628955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092516S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"34169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"34169","articleId":"1628955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1628958,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper models the risk and insecure conditions in grid job scheduling. Three risk-resilient strategies, preemptive, replication, and delay-tolerant, are developed to provide security assurance. We propose six risk-resilient scheduling algorithms to assure secure grid job execution under different risky conditions. We report the simulated grid performances of these new grid job scheduling algorithms under the NAS and PSA workloads. The relative performance is measured by the total job makespan, grid resource utilization, job failure rate, slowdown ratio, replication overhead, etc. In addition to extending from known scheduling heuristics, we developed a new space-time genetic algorithm (STGA) based on faster searching and protected chromosome formation. Our simulation results suggest that, in a wide-area grid environment, it is more resilient for the global job scheduler to tolerate some job delays instead of resorting to preemption or replication or taking a risk on unreliable resources allocated. We find that delay-tolerant min-min and STGA job scheduling have 13-23 percent higher performance than using risky or preemptive or replicated algorithms. The resource overheads for replicated job scheduling are kept at a low 15 percent. The delayed job execution is optimized with a delay factor, which is 20 percent of the total makespan. A Kiviat graph is proposed for demonstrating the quality of grid computing services. These risk-resilient job scheduling schemes can upgrade grid performance significantly at only a moderate increase in extra resources or scheduling delays in a risky grid computing environment","doi":"10.1109/TC.2006.89","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/34169/01628958.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"703","endPage":"719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Risk-resilient heuristics and genetic algorithms for security-assured grid job scheduling","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1628958/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8951645","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk-resilient heuristics and genetic algorithms for security-assured grid job scheduling","sourcePdf":"01628958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042194S","chronDate":"June  2006","isNumber":"34169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"142","articleId":"1628958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1628959,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hsu Yen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineerng, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/34169/1628959/1628959-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Hsu Yen received the BS degree in electrical engineering from National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, in 1995 and the MS degree in electrical engineering from Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan, in 1997.

Because errors occur within a function, it is not easy to predict the output. Therefore, general error control codes are not suited for AES operations. In this work, several error-detection schemes have been proposed. These schemes are based on the (n+1, n) cyclic redundancy check (CRC) over GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">8</sup>\n), where nisin{4,8,16}. Because of the good algebraic properties of AES, specifically the MixColumns operation, these error detection schemes are suitable for AES and efficient for the hardware implementation; they may be designed using round-level, operation-level, or algorithm-level detection. The proposed schemes have high fault coverage. In addition, the schemes proposed are scalable and symmetrical. The scalability makes these schemes suitable for an AES circuit implemented in 8-bit, 32-bit, or 128-bit architecture. Symmetry also benefits the implementation of the proposed schemes to achieve that the encryption process and the decryption process can share the same error detection hardware. These schemes are also suitable for encryption-only or decryption-only cases.

Since the configuration memory defines which circuit an SRAM-based FPGA implements, any modification induced by SEUs may dramatically change the implemented circuit. When such devices are used in safety-critical applications, fault-tolerant techniques are needed to mitigate the effects of SEUs in FPGAs' configuration memory. In this paper, we analyze the effects induced by the SEUs in the configuration memory of SRAM-based FPGAs. The reported analysis outlines that SEUs in the FPGA's configuration memory are particularly critical since they are able to escape well-known fault masking techniques such as triple modular redundancy (TMR). We then present a reliability-oriented place and route algorithm that, coupled with TMR, is able to effectively mitigate the effects of the considered faults. The effectiveness of the new reliability-oriented place and route algorithm is demonstrated by extensive fault injection experiments showing that the capability of tolerating SEU effects in the FPGA's configuration memory increases up to 85 times with respect to a standard TMR design technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1628960/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","accessionNumber":"8951647","volume":"55","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new reliability-oriented place and route algorithm for SRAM-based FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new reliability-oriented place and route algorithm for SRAM-based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"01628960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132217S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"34169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"34169","articleId":"1628960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1628963,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Joshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/34169/1628963/1628963-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ajay Joshi received the BE degree in instrumentation engineering from the University of Pune, India, in 1998 and the MS degree in electrical and computer engineering from Ohio State University in 2001.

Thus, it is imperative that automotive electrical power systems will obviously undergo a drastic change in the next 10-20 years. Currently, the situation in the automotive industry is such that the demands for higher fuel economy and more electric power are driving advanced vehicular power system voltages to higher levels. For example, the projected increase in total power demand is estimated to be about three to four times that of the current value. This means that the total future power demand of a typical advanced vehicle could roughly reach a value as high as 10 kW. In order to satisfy this huge vehicular load, the approach is to integrate power electronics intensive solutions within advanced vehicular power systems. In view of this fact, this paper aims at reviewing the present situation as well as projected future research and development work of advanced vehicular electrical power systems including those of electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell vehicles (EVs, HEVs, and FCVs). The paper will first introduce the proposed power system architectures for HEVs and FCVs and will then go on to exhaustively discuss the specific applications of dc/dc and dc/ac power electronic converters in advanced automotive power systems","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2006.872378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/34172/01628996.pdf","startPage":"567","endPage":"577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2006.872378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power electronics intensive solutions for advanced electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell vehicular power systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1628996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Power electronics intensive solutions for advanced electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell vehicular power systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1628996/","publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8908673","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1628996/","volume":"21","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power electronics intensive solutions for advanced electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell vehicular power systems","sourcePdf":"01628996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094422S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"34172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"466","xplore-issue":"34172","articleId":"1628996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1628997,"authors":[{"name":"O.

These include robustness to harsh operational conditions, rugged structure, fault resilient performance, and a wide range of speed. The main debate over the adequacy of switched reluctance drives in automotive applications has often focused on efficiency and position sensorless control over the entire speed range, adaptation of control algorithms in the presence of parameter variations, and high levels of acoustic noise and vibration. The present paper demonstrates three key technologies developed over the past few years that have resulted in tangible improvements in the performance of SRM/generators (SRM/G) as related to the above areas of interest. This paper intends to illustrate the new possibilities and remaining challenges in applications of SRM in automotive industry.

This paper proposes a motion-sensorless motor/generator control of PM-RSM from zero speed up to maximum speed, using direct torque and flux control with space vector modulation. A quasioptimal stator flux reference with a flux versus torque functional is proposed. A stator flux observer in wide speed range uses combined voltage-current models for low speeds, and only the voltage model for medium to high speeds, both in proportional-integral closed loop. A novel rotor speed and position observer with a fusion strategy employs signal injection and only one D-module vector filter in stator reference for low speed, combined with a speed observer from the stator flux vector estimation-for medium-high speed. The proposed system is introduced piece by piece and then implemented on a dSpace 1103 control board with a 350-A metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor-pulse-width modulation converter connected to a 42-Vdc, 55-Ah battery, and a 140-Nm peak torque PM-RSM.

The critical portion of any HEV electrical system consists of a power electronic converter (inverter) and a suitable traction motor. Thus, the efficiency analysis of the inverter/motor is of prime importance for the calculation of the overall efficiency of the drive trains. This paper aims at modeling the efficiencies of the traction motor/controller through efficiency maps. Efficiency maps are a convenient way to represent motor drive systems of large and complex systems, like that of a HEV.

Economics play a major role as evidenced by oil prices in North America pressing upwards of $100/Bbl coupled with a customer preference for full size crossover and sport utility vehicles. The situation in Oceania is milder, but emerging markets such as China are experiencing automotive sector growth rates of 37%/year. Europe remains least affected by hybrids since nearly 47% of all new vehicles sold are diesel fueled and have economy ratings on par with that of gasoline-electric hybrids. In the global economy there are presently some 57 Mil new vehicles manufactured each year. Toyota and Honda have projected that HEVs will be 10 % to 15 % of the U.S. market by 2009, with Toyota raising the bar further by stating they will produce 1 Mil hybrids a year in the 2012 time frame.

One of the designed SMCs performs engine speed control, while the other controls the engine/generator torque, together achieving the engine operation in the optimal efficiency region of the torque-speed curve. The control strategy is designed for application on a SHEV converted from a standard high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV) and simulated by using the Matlab-based PNGV Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). The performance of the control strategy is compared with that of the original PSAT model, which utilizes PI controllers, a feedforward term for the engine torque, and comprehensive maps for the engine, generator and power converter (static only), which constitute the auxiliary power unit (APU). In this study, in spite of the simple modeling approach taken to model the APU and the optimal efficiency region, an improved performance has been achieved with the new SMC based strategy in terms of overall efficiency, engine efficiency, fuel economy, and emissions.

To obtain zero steady-state error at the fundamental frequency (i.e., unity power factor), the use of a standard integrator in a rotating frame is as effective as the use of a resonant controller in a stationary frame.

By exploiting the variable frequency response of the stepped-impedance resonator, resonators can be shared by the two filter channels of the desired diplexer if their fundamental and the first spurious resonant frequency are properly assigned. Size reduction are, therefore, achieved by introducing a few common resonator sections in the circuit. This concept has been verified by the experimental results of two diplexer circuits.

The results show that the inverse class-F amplifier has better efficiency than that of class-F amplifiers as the on-resistance of the transistor increases. For experimental comparison, we have designed and implemented the class-F and inverse class-F amplifiers at I-GHz band using a GaAs MESFET and analyzed the measured performances.

The novelty of this study resides in our successful design, fabrication, and testing of low-loss SIWs that achieve 100% relative bandwidths via optimal excitation of the dominant TE/sub 10/ mode and avoidance of the excitation of the TE/sub 20/ mode. Furthermore, our optimal structures maintain their 100% relative bandwidth while transmitting around 45/spl deg/ and 90/spl deg/ bends, and achieve measured crosstalk of better than -30 dB over the entire passband. We consider SIWs operating at center frequencies of 50 GHz, accommodating in principle data rates of greater than 50 Gb/s. These SIWs are 35% narrower in the transverse direction and provide a 20% larger relative bandwidth than our previously reported electromagnetic bandgap waveguiding digital interconnects. Since existing circuit-board technology permits dimensional reductions of the SIWs by yet another factor of 4:1 relative to the ones discussed here, bandpass operation at center frequencies approaching 200 GHz with data rates of 200 Gb/s are feasible. These data rates meet or exceed those expected eventually for proposed silicon photonic technologies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Substrate integrated waveguides optimized for ultrahigh-speed digital interconnects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.873622","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34173/01629040.pdf","startPage":"1983","endPage":"1990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.873622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Substrate integrated waveguides optimized for ultrahigh-speed digital interconnects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1629040/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8927192","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Substrate integrated waveguides optimized for ultrahigh-speed digital interconnects","sourcePdf":"01629040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107945S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"34173","articleId":"1629040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1629041,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the proposed scheme, two independent sets of reflection and transmission coefficient data for each material-under-test (MUT) are measured by aligning the electric field vector of the dominant TE/sub 10/ mode in the rectangular waveguide parallel and perpendicular to the fiber orientation of the uniaxial sample, respectively. The complex permittivity tensor of the MUT is determined from these measured scattering data in two successive steps. The first step uses the newly proposed analytical approach, which can resolve the ambiguity problem, commonly encountered with samples of electrical length larger than a wavelength. In the second step, nonlinear least square optimization algorithms are employed, where the material parameters using the first step are now used as the initial guess. The proposed two-step approach is valid for multilayered structures, and the local minima problem commonly encountered with optimization routines are also avoided. A number of carbon-fiber composite materials along and, transverse to the fiber orientation are measured using the proposed method.

The Ka-band electromagnetic wave offers higher detection sensitivity on small movement due to its shorter wavelength. Indirect-conversion receiver architecture is chosen to reduce the dc offset and 1/f noise that can degrade the signal-to-noise ratio and detection accuracy. Furthermore, the double-sideband signals at the transmitter output can be in quadrature by choosing a proper frequency separation to relieve the severe null point problem that occurs at high frequency. As a result,the detection accuracy is significantly improved with low transmitted power. This radar sensor system achieves better than 80% detection accuracy at a distance of 2.0 m with a combined transmitted power of only 12.5 /spl mu/W in both sidebands.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.873625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34173/01629044.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.873625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34173","startPage":"2023","endPage":"2032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-tuning technique for remote detection of heartbeat and respiration using low-power double-sideband transmission in the ka-band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-tuning technique for remote detection of heartbeat and respiration using low-power double-sideband transmission in the ka-band","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8927196","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1629044/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-tuning technique for remote detection of heartbeat and respiration using low-power double-sideband transmission in the ka-band","sourcePdf":"01629044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057291S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"34173","articleId":"1629044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1629048,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

Inclusion of the nonlinear source resistance in a physics-based device simulator produces excellent agreement between simulated and measured data.

The proposed procedure is capable of online adapting the LUT spacing for PAs with various nonlinear characteristics, for input signals with various statistics, and for wireless environments with various time-varying properties.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Predistortion","Table lookup","Nonlinear distortion","Mobile communication","Costs","Statistics","Intermodulation distortion","Feedforward systems","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","table lookup","linearisation techniques","mobile radio","distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic optimization","lookup table spacing","power amplifier predistortion linearization","digital adaptive predistortion","system state information","wireless communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic optimization","lookup table (LUT)","power amplifier (PA)","predistortion linearization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.872808","startPage":"2118","endPage":"2127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34173/01629054.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.872808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically optimum lookup-table spacing for power amplifier predistortion linearization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamically optimum lookup-table spacing for power amplifier predistortion linearization","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8927206","publicationDate":"May 2006","volume":"54","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1629054/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically optimum lookup-table spacing for power amplifier predistortion linearization","sourcePdf":"01629054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073292S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"34173","articleId":"1629054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1629056,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Space-time beamforming is used to preprocess input signals from both UWB and NB sources. The train of UWB pulses or the NB sinusoidal signals are then transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas into the breast. Performance is evaluated using finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic (EM) and thermal simulations with realistic numerical breast phantoms derived from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the breast. We use three methods of mapping MRI data to complex permittivity data to account for uncertainty in the embodiment of the dielectric properties transitions in heterogeneous breast tissue. EM power-density deposition profiles and temperature profiles are compared for the UWB and NB cases in the three different breast phantoms. Dominant mechanisms that influence the efficacy of focusing UWB and NB signals in the breast are identified. The results of this study suggest that, while NB focusing performs reasonably well when the excitation frequency is optimized, UWB focusing consistently performs better, offering the potential for tighter focusing and greater reduction of hot spots, particularly in breast tissue, which exhibits distinct dielectric-properties boundaries within the tissue heterogeneity.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.872790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34173/01629060.pdf","startPage":"2169","endPage":"2180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.872790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computational study of ultra-wideband versus narrowband microwave hyperthermia for breast cancer treatment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629060/","displayDocTitle":"A computational study of ultra-wideband versus narrowband microwave hyperthermia for breast cancer treatment","volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8927212","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1629060/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computational study of ultra-wideband versus narrowband microwave hyperthermia for breast cancer treatment","sourcePdf":"01629060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103102S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"34173","articleId":"1629060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1629061,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Two novel methods to model the coupled microstrip with a lumped equivalent circuit are proposed. The circuit model is obtained without using normal mode decomposition. Therefore, the circuit can be used in any excitation. We briefly review the stored energy equation for the inductance and power dissipation for the resistance when the interconnect consists of more than one signal conductor. In the first method, the rational function for impedance has common poles. Thus, an equivalent-circuit model is obtained in a fast and systematic way. In the second method, a more direct way of evaluating series impedance is proposed. Here, a more complicated method of pole selection leads to better accuracy in the frequency domain. A lumped-element equivalent circuit is obtained, which contains only series resistors, series inductors, and shunt capacitors. Hence, the circuit model should be very fast in transient simulation. Three examples are presented to demonstrate and validate the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.873635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34173/01629067.pdf","startPage":"2232","endPage":"2242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.873635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and direct coupled-micro strip interconnect reduced-order modeling based on the finite-element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629067/","displayDocTitle":"Fast and direct coupled-micro strip interconnect reduced-order modeling based on the finite-element method","volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8927219","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1629067/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and direct coupled-micro strip interconnect reduced-order modeling based on the finite-element method","sourcePdf":"01629067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132564S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"34173","articleId":"1629067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1629072,"authors":[{"name":"Guilin Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/34173/1629072/1629072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guilin Sun (S'01\u2013M'05) received the B.Sc. degree from the Xi' An Institute of Technology, Xi' An, China, in 1982, the M.Sc. degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1988, respectively, both in optical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in electrical engineering.","From 1988 to 1994, he was an Assistant Professor with the Xi' an Institute of Technology.

By generalizing the threshold function of adalines, we achieve the K-state transfer function of gadalines which responds a unitary vector of K binary values to the projection of a predictor on a receptive field. A generative component that uses the K-state activation of a gadaline to trigger K posterior independent normal variables is employed to emulate stochastic predictor-oriented target generation. The fitness of a generative component to a set of paired data mathematically translates to a mixed integer and linear programming. Since consisting of continuous and discrete variables, the mathematical framework is resolved by a hybrid of the mean field annealing and gradient descent methods. Following the leave-one-out learning strategy, the obtained learning method is extended for optimizing multiple generative components. The learning result leads to parameters of a deterministic gadaline network for function approximation. Numerical simulations further test the proposed learning method with paired data oriented from a variety of target functions.

The first method employs discriminant analysis in the features derived from NMF. In this way, a two-phase discriminant feature extraction procedure is implemented, namely NMF plus Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The second method incorporates the discriminant constraints inside the NMF decomposition. Thus, a decomposition of a face to its discriminant parts is obtained and new update rules for both the weights and the basis images are derived.

Lidar data gives a sequence of laser backscatter intensities obtained from laser shots generated from an airborne object at various altitudes above the earth surface. Lidar data is pre-filtered to remove high frequency noise. As the Lidar shots are taken from above the earth surface, it has some air backscatter information, which is of no importance for detecting underwater objects. Because of these, the air backscatter information is eliminated from the data and a segment of this data is subsequently selected to extract features for classification. This is then encoded using linear predictive coding (LPC) and polynomial approximation. The coefficients thus generated are used as inputs to the two branches of a parallel neural architecture. The decisions obtained from the two branches are vector multiplied and the result is fed to an SVM-based IE that presents the final inference. Two parallel neural architectures using multilayer perception (MLP) and hybrid radial basis function (HRBF) are considered in this paper. The proposed structure fits the Lidar data classification task well due to the inherent classification efficiency of neural networks and accurate decision-making capability of SVM. A Bayesian classifier and a quadratic classifier were considered for the Lidar data classification task but they failed to offer high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a single-layered artificial neural network (ANN) classifier was also considered and it failed to offer good accuracy. The parallel ANN architecture proposed in this paper offers high prediction accuracy (98.9%) and is found to be the most suitable architecture for the proposed task of Lidar data classification.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Object detection","Underwater tracking","Artificial neural networks","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Backscatter","Laser noise","Earth","Linear predictive coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical radar","neural net architecture","support vector machines","inference mechanisms","backscatter","feature extraction","object detection","polynomial approximation","multilayer perceptrons","radial basis function networks","decision making","Bayes methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater object lidar detection","neuro-SVM-based architecture","support vector machine","parallel neural network architecture","inference engine","laser backscatter intensities","laser shots","feature extraction","linear predictive coding","polynomial approximation","multilayer perception","hybrid radial basis function","decision-making capability","Bayesian classifier","quadratic classifier","single-layered artificial neural network classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier transform (FFT)","Lidar-based object detection","linear prediction","neural network classification","signal processing-based feature extraction","support vector machines","underwater object detection"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Information Storage and Retrieval","Lasers","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Radar","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2006.873279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/34174/01629094.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.873279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lidar detection of underwater objects using a neuro-SVM-based architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lidar detection of underwater objects using a neuro-SVM-based architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629094/","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1629094/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8910673","pubMedId":"16722175","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lidar detection of underwater objects using a neuro-SVM-based architecture","sourcePdf":"01629094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064014S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"34174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"34174","articleId":"1629094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1629097,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/34174/1629097/1629097-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsin Chen (M'04) was born in 1974 in Taiwan.

In this paper we concentrate on rate-coded AER. The problem is addressed as an algorithmic problem, in which different methods are proposed, implemented and tested through software algorithms. The proposed algorithms are comparatively evaluated according to different criteria. Emphasis is put on the potential of such algorithms for a) doing the frame-based to event-based representation in real time, and b) that the resulting event streams resemble as much as possible those generated naturally by rate-coded address-event VLSI chips, such as silicon AER retinae. It is found that simple and straightforward algorithms tend to have high potential for real time but produce event distributions that differ considerably from those obtained in AER VLSI chips. On the other hand, sophisticated algorithms that yield better event distributions are not efficient for real time operations. The methods based on linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR) pseudorandom number generation is a good compromise, which is feasible for real time and yield reasonably well distributed events in time. Our software experiments, on a 1.6-GHz Pentium IV, show that at 50% AER bus load the proposed algorithms require between 0.011 and 1.14 ms per 8 bit-pixel per frame. One of the proposed LFSR methods is implemented in real time hardware using a prototyping board that includes a VirtexE 300 FPGA. The demonstration hardware is capable of transforming frames of 64times64 pixels of 8-bit depth at a frame rate of 25 frames per second, producing spike events at a peak rate of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup>\nevents per second","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2006.872253","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/34174/01629098.pdf","startPage":"771","endPage":"788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.872253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On algorithmic rate-coded AER generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"On algorithmic rate-coded AER generation","volume":"17","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","accessionNumber":"8910677","pubMedId":"16722179","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1629098/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629098/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On algorithmic rate-coded AER generation","sourcePdf":"01629098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111258S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"34174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"34174","articleId":"1629098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1629101,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Although various algorithms exist for the underdetermined BSS problem for sparse sources, as well as for the PNL BSS problem with as many mixtures as sources, the nonlinear problem in an underdetermined scenario has not been satisfactorily solved yet. The method proposed in this letter aims at inverting the different nonlinearities, thus reducing the problem to linear underdetermined BSS. To this end, first a spectral clustering technique is applied that clusters the mixture samples into different sets corresponding to the different sources. Then, the inverse nonlinearities are estimated using a set of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that are trained by minimizing a specifically designed cost function. Finally, transforming each mixture by its corresponding inverse nonlinearity results in a linear underdetermined BSS problem, which can be solved using any of the existing methods","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spectral clustering approach to underdetermined postnonlinear blind source separation of sparse sources","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2006.872358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/34174/01629104.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.872358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"A spectral clustering approach to underdetermined postnonlinear blind source separation of sparse sources","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1629104/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8910683","pubMedId":"16722185","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spectral clustering approach to underdetermined postnonlinear blind source separation of sparse sources","sourcePdf":"01629104.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044343S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"34174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"34174","articleId":"1629104","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1629105,"authors":[{"name":"Zidong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"lastName":"Zidong Wang","id":"37279246200"},{"name":"Yurong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yurong Liu","id":"37405173900"},{"name":"Maozhen Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"lastName":"Maozhen Li","id":"37068000700"},{"name":"Xiaohui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"lastName":"Xiaohui Liu","id":"37280573800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"1629105","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":369,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1227},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Stochastic processes","Neural networks","Delay effects","Asymptotic stability","Cellular neural networks","Linear matrix inequalities","Hopfield neural networks","Sufficient conditions","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","convergence","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","stochastic processes","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks","mixed time delays","global asymptotic stability analysis problem","discrete time delays","distributed time delays","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","stochastic stability analysis theory","linear matrix inequality","global asymptotic convergence","mean square","Matlab LMI toolbox"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cohen\u2013Grossberg neural networks","discrete delays","distributed delays","global asymptotic stability","linear matrix inequality (LMI)","Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Statistical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Stochastic Processes","Systems Theory","Time Factors"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the global asymptotic stability analysis problem is considered for a class of stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed time delays, which consist of both the discrete and distributed time delays. Based on an Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the stochastic stability analysis theory, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to derive several sufficient conditions guaranteeing the global asymptotic convergence of the equilibrium point in the mean square. It is shown that the addressed stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed delays are globally asymptotically stable in the mean square if two LMIs are feasible, where the feasibility of LMIs can be readily checked by the Matlab LMI toolbox.

Efficient quantum-logic circuits that perform two tasks are discussed: 1) implementing generic quantum computations, and 2) initializing quantum registers. In contrast to conventional computing, the latter task is nontrivial because the state space of an n-qubit register is not finite and contains exponential superpositions of classical bitstrings. The proposed circuits are asymptotically optimal for respective tasks and improve earlier published results by at least a factor of 2. The circuits for generic quantum computation constructed by the algorithms are the most efficient known today in terms of the number of most expensive gates [quantum controlled-NOTs (CNOTs)]. They are based on an analog of the Shannon decomposition of Boolean functions and a new circuit block, called quantum multiplexor (QMUX), which generalizes several known constructions. A theoretical lower bound implies that the circuits cannot be improved by more than a factor of 2. It is additionally shown how to accommodate the severe architectural limitation of using only nearest neighbor gates, which is representative of current implementation technologies. This increases the number of gates by almost an order of magnitude, but preserves the asymptotic optimality of gate counts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","volume":"25","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8959011","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1629135/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of quantum-logic circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of quantum-logic circuits","sourcePdf":"01629135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138223S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"34175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"34175","articleId":"1629135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1629145,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The bumpless interconnect is a novel concept of bonding technology that enables a narrow bonding pitch of less than 10 /spl mu/m by overcoming the thermal strain problem. In the bumpless structure, two thin layers including an insulator and metallic interconnections on the same surface are bonded at room temperature by the surface-activated bonding (SAB) method. In order to realize the bumpless interconnect, we invented a SAB flip-chip bonder that enabled the alignment accuracy of /spl plusmn/1 /spl mu/m in the high vacuum condition. Moreover, the fabrication process of ultrafine Cu electrodes was developed by using the damascene process and reactive ion beam etching (RIE) process, and the bumpless electrodes of 3 /spl mu/m in diameter, 10 /spl mu/m in pitch, and 60 nm in height were formed. As a result, we succeeded in the interconnection of 100 000 bumpless electrodes with the interfacial resistance of less than 1 m/spl Omega/. An increase of the resistance was considerably small after thermal aging at 150/spl deg/C for 1000 h.","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2006.873138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/34176/01629163.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2006.873138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bumpless interconnect through ultrafine Cu electrodes by means of surface-activated bonding (SAB) method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Bumpless interconnect through ultrafine Cu electrodes by means of surface-activated bonding (SAB) method","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8926916","htmlLink":"/document/1629163/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bumpless interconnect through ultrafine Cu electrodes by means of surface-activated bonding (SAB) method","sourcePdf":"01629163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085278S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"34176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"34176","articleId":"1629163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1629170,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Yan Tee","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/34176/1629170/1629170-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tong Yan Tee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.","He has over ten years of working experience in design for package and board-level reliability.

This paper studies the design comparison of five types of thermally enhanced BGAs, i.e., conduction cooled BGA (C/sup 2/BGA), metal-core BGA, exposed-die land grid array (LGA), slug LGA, and spreader LGA. The solder joint reliability performance of thermally enhanced BGAs is benchmarked with conventional thin-profile fine-pitch ball grid array (TFBGA). Both global and local three-dimensional finite-element analysis (FEA) models are established to predict the fatigue life of solder joints during thermal cycle testing. Detailed pad design with realistic geometry of solder balls and nonlinear material properties are considered in the model. The fatigue model is based on a modified Darveaux's approach with nonlinear viscoplastic analysis of solder joints. For the test vehicles studied, the critical solder joints are located near the package corner. Design variations investigated include the effects of key package dimensions and material properties. Design variations are mainly reported using C/sup 2/BGA package as the trend for the other four thermally enhanced BGAs was similar. The choice of mold compound (MC) material is critical, and a material with higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE/sub 1/) and lower modulus is preferred. Die size, die attach, and slug-attach material have little effect on solder joint reliability. It is observed that there is good correlation of fatigue life between modeling prediction and thermal cycle testing for C/sup 2/BGA. Reliability of C/sup 2/BGA thermal solder joints is proven to be excellent, and heat can be effectively conducted away from the die to the PCB. This is crucial to the design of C/sup 2/BGA. In addition, solder joint fatigue life is found to be related to package warpage induced during thermal cycling test. A design with less package warpage usually has a longer fatigue life.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1629170/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","accessionNumber":"8926923","volume":"29","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Board-level solder joint reliability analysis of thermally enhanced BGAs and LGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Board-level solder joint reliability analysis of thermally enhanced BGAs and LGAs","sourcePdf":"01629170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109229S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"34176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"34176","articleId":"1629170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1629175,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wang","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/34176/1629175/1629175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Wang (S'00\u2013M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering, both with honors, from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1992 and 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Missouri-Rolla in 2004.","From 1995 to 1998, she was a Circuit Design Engineer with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China.

Full-wave methods are often employed to study the power integrity problem. While full-wave methods can be accurate, they are time and memory consuming. The cavity model of a rectangular structure has previously been employed to efficiently analyze the simultaneous switching noise (SSN) in the power distribution network. However, a large number of modes in the cavity model are needed to accurately simulate the impedance associated with the vias, leading to computational inefficiency. A fast approach is detailed herein to accelerate calculation of the summation associated with the higher-order modes. Closed-form expressions for the parasitics associated with the interconnects of the decoupling capacitors are also introduced. Combining the fast calculation of the cavity models of regularly shaped planar circuits, a segmentation method, and closed-form expressions for the parasitics, an efficient approach is proposed herein to analyze an arbitrary shaped power distribution network. While it may take many hours for a full-wave method to do a single simulation, the proposed method can generally perform the simulation with good accuracy in several minutes. Another advantage of the proposed method is that a SPICE equivalent circuit of the power distribution network can be derived. This allows both frequency and transient responses to be done with SPICE simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient approach for power delivery network design with closed-form expressions for parasitic interconnect inductances","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2006.871202","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/34176/01629175.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2006.871202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34176","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629175/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"An efficient approach for power delivery network design with closed-form expressions for parasitic interconnect inductances","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1629175/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8926928","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient approach for power delivery network design with closed-form expressions for parasitic interconnect inductances","sourcePdf":"01629175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.239136S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"34176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"34176","articleId":"1629175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1629224,"authors":[{"name":"O.G.

Only dominant contributions need to be taken into account, thereby highlighting those mechanisms generating distortion and their features in the frequency domain. Moreover, the adopted approach provides useful design guidelines and explains why the NM compensation technique allows generally better linearity performance at low frequency and why the reversed NM is best suited to high frequencies.

The results show that the optimal filter can significantly outperform conventional linear filters in terms of both MSE and maximum error. The performance of conventional /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ data converters is then compared to that of incremental /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ with optimal filtering for bandlimited signals. It is shown that incremental /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ can outperform the conventional approach in terms of signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio.

This paper proposes a new LDPC decoding architecture to reduce registers and alleviate complex interconnections. To reduce the number of messages to be exchanged among processing units (PUs), two data flows that can be loosely coupled are developed by allowing duplicated operations. In addition, intermediate values are grouped and stored into local storages each of which is accessed by only one PU. In order to save area, local storages are implemented using memories instead of registers. A partially parallel architecture is proposed to promote the memory usage and an efficient algorithm that schedules the processing order of the partially parallel architecture is also proposed to reduce the overall processing time by overlapping operations. To verify the proposed architecture, a 1024 bit rate-1/2 LDPC decoder is implemented using a 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS process. The decoder runs correctly at the frequency of 200 MHz, which enables almost 1 Gbps decoding throughput. Since the proposed decoder occupies an area of 10.08 mm/sup 2/, it is less than one fifth of area compared to the previous architecture.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.862181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.862181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/34179/01629243.pdf","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loosely coupled memory-based decoding architecture for low density parity check codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Loosely coupled memory-based decoding architecture for low density parity check codes","volume":"53","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1629243/","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8975794","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629243/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loosely coupled memory-based decoding architecture for low density parity check codes","sourcePdf":"01629243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059626S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"34179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"34179","articleId":"1629243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1629245,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

Apart from flexibility of implementation, the proposed structures offer significantly lower area-time complexity compared with the existing structures. The proposed schemes of computation of the DHT can conveniently be scaled not only for higher transform lengths but also according to the hardware constraint or the throughput requirement of the application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable and modular memory-based systolic architectures for discrete Hartley transform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2006.870225","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/34179/01629245.pdf","startPage":"1065","endPage":"1077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2006.870225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Scalable and modular memory-based systolic architectures for discrete Hartley transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1629245/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8975796","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable and modular memory-based systolic architectures for discrete Hartley transform","sourcePdf":"01629245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125804S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"34179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"34179","articleId":"1629245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1629250,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

The analysis of the one-dimensional (1-D) version of such a LWA excited by a line source shows that a central role in establishing the features of broadside radiation is played by the condition that the phase and attenuation constants of the leaky mode responsible for radiation are equal. When this happens, a beam with a single peak at broadside is on the verge of splitting into two distinct peaks, and maximum power density is radiated at broadside. Design formulas to achieve such an optimized condition, as well as approximate expressions for the frequency bandwidth and pattern beamwidth of the antenna and for the leaky-wave phase and attenuation constants are derived, both in the absence and in the presence of losses; in addition, an optimal-beamwidth condition (which gives the narrowest broadside beam) is derived.

This is accomplished by replacing the solid metal around the traditional slot antennas with a specific metallic pattern that can be viewed as a series of parallel strip lines placed around the slot antenna. This metallic pattern is then modified by designing the parallel strips in a compact fashion to reduce the overall antenna dimensions and obtain a reduced-size CBSA. It is shown that, for a simple straight slot antenna, the overall occupied volume of the modified cavity backing the slot antenna can be reduced by more than 65% without affecting the high radiation efficiency of the antenna. A number of traditional cavity backed slot antennas and the proposed modified CBSAs are designed, fabricated, and measured. The reduced-size CBSAs show a very low input VSWR, low cross-polarized radiation levels, and high radiation efficiency.

This FDTD model removes the approximations made in other similar models to extend its applicability, and incorporates a variety of existing methods and new techniques. A dispersive and anisotropic realization of the nearly perfectly matched layer (NPML) absorbing boundary condition is adopted in this numerical model for ease of implementation. Earth curvature is included in the model through the modified refractive index method. The surface impedance boundary condition is adopted to treat arbitrary but homogeneous ground parameters. We quantify the errors through dispersion relations, and the solution convergence is analyzed. Comparisons between our simulation, numerical waveguide mode theory, and experimental data validate this model and show its capabilities compared to other methods. Although this FDTD model was developed for the lightning-generated electromagnetic field simulation, it is also applicable for other very low frequency (VLF, 3-30 kHz) and extremely low frequency (ELF, 3-3000 Hz) wave propagation problems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/34180/01629282.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2006.874336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2006.874336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FDTD model for low and high altitude lightning-generated EM fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic modeling","Electromagnetic propagation","Dispersion","Boundary conditions","Frequency","Electromagnetic scattering","Ionosphere","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","dispersion relations","Earth-ionosphere waveguide","finite difference time-domain analysis","ionospheric disturbances","lightning","refractive index","surface impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain analysis","FDTD model","electromagnetic wave propagation","altitude lightning-generated EM field","lightning-related ionospheric phenomena","nearly perfect matched layer","NPML absorbion","refractive index method","surface impedance boundary condition","homogeneous ground parameter","dispersion relation","convergence solution","numerical waveguide mode theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic propagation in plasma media","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","ionosphere","lightning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"An FDTD model for low and high altitude lightning-generated EM fields","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1629282/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8907371","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FDTD model for low and high altitude lightning-generated EM fields","sourcePdf":"01629282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.231424S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"34180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"34180","articleId":"1629282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1629290,"authors":[{"name":"K.L.

For this receiver simulation results are presented that show no significant performance deterioration in fast fading. Also, the performance of this receiver when only some channel coefficients are estimated perfectly and the rest are interpolated values is also shown","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2005-April 2 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1629344/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9054544","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On Space Time Block Codes in Non Quasi-Static Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Space Time Block Codes in Non Quasi-Static Fading Channels","confLoc":"Memphis, TN","sourcePdf":"01629344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042401S","chronDate":"March 31 2005-April 2 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10844","isNumber":"34182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10844","xplore-issue":"34182","articleId":"1629344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1629346,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To prevent saturation of the following building blocks, diode bridges are added. To provide enough gain in the RF front-end receiver, three single stage LNAs are cascaded. To overcome the drawback of the low resistive silicon substrate, we suggest a practical method called GSML for low loss and predictable high frequency interconnection lines.

We propose a new security- and heterogeneity-driven scheduling algorithm (SHARP for short), which strives to maximize the probability that parallel applications are executed in time without any risk of being attacked. Because of high security overhead in existing clusters, an important step in scheduling is to guarantee jobs' security requirements while minimizing overall execution times. The SHARP algorithm accounts for security constraints in addition to different processing capabilities of each node in a cluster. We introduce two novel performance metrics, degree of security deficiency and risk-free probability, to quantitatively measure quality of security provided by a heterogeneous cluster. Both security and performance of SHARP are compared with two well-known scheduling algorithms.

The proposed algorithm tries to minimize the required transmit power while satisfying the rate requirement and BER constraint of each user. Subcarrier and power allocation are performed in two steps. We are mainly focusing on the subcarrier allocation step. First subcarriers are grouped to reduce the computational complexity of the allocation algorithm. Then we employ proportional constraints in terms of rate ratios to assure each user to achieve the target data rate in advance. Simulation results show that this low complexity resource allocation scheme achieves better performance than the fixed frequency division approach and shows comparable performance compared to previously derived suboptimal resource distribution schemes. It is also shown that with rate constraints the capacity is distributed more fairly and rationally among users","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10845/34183/01629395.pdf","startPage":"5 pp.","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/.2006.1629395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/.2006.1629395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A grouped and proportional-fair subcarrier allocation scheme for multiuser OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Fading","Intersymbol interference","Bit error rate","Computational complexity","Data communication","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Information technology","Content addressable storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","error statistics","minimisation","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grouped-subcarrier allocation algorithm","multiuser OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","minimization","BER","bit error rate","power allocation","resource allocation scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"A grouped and proportional-fair subcarrier allocation scheme for multiuser OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1629395/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9005284","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A grouped and proportional-fair subcarrier allocation scheme for multiuser OFDM systems","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"01629395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057552S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10845","isNumber":"34183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10845","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"34183","articleId":"1629395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1629410,"authors":[{"name":"F.

However as the cell integration density increases, NAND flash memory cell shows the problem of increased parasitic capacitance between the cells.

It is believed that trapping mainly occurs where tunnel oxide is locally thin. For example, conventional SAP (self-aligned poly) process with shallow trench isolation, tunnel oxide at active edge is necessarily thinner than active channel. In this paper, we proposed a new process scheme to fabricate optimized tunnel oxide thickness varying from active center to edge, and we confirmed the improvement of reliability characteristics such as Vth shift and interface trap density during endurance cycling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Feb. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8956882","htmlLink":"/document/1629484/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","conferenceDate":"12-16 Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Cell Structure with Edge-thick Tunnel Oxide for Highly Reliable NAND Flash Memory Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Cell Structure with Edge-thick Tunnel Oxide for Highly Reliable NAND Flash Memory Devices","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1629484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05948S","chronDate":"12-16 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10846","isNumber":"34184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10846","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34184","articleId":"1629484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1629491,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Hyun Lee","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang-Hyun Lee","id":"37087380397"},{"name":"Changseok Kang","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Changseok Kang","id":"37087315736"},{"name":"Jaesung Sim","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jaesung Sim","id":"37087315109"},{"name":"Jang-Sik Lee","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jang-Sik Lee","id":"37087315854"},{"name":"Juhyung kim","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Juhyung kim","id":"37088621455"},{"name":"Yoocheol Shin","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yoocheol Shin","id":"37087316092"},{"name":"Ki-Tae Park","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Tae Park","id":"37087316603"},{"name":"Sanghun Jeon","affiliation":["Semiconductor R&D Center, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sanghun Jeon","id":"37087197782"},{"name":"J.

The retrieval of digital audio, based on similarities between feature vectors of querying and stored audio material, is considered. We used wavelet descriptors for characterizing short music sequences and Euclidean distance as an objective similarity measure. Since music sequences may be subjectively classified in different ways, the retrieval process is upgraded by user's feedback and neural network decision. After the first pass, from the initial set of sequences ordered related to objectively measured distances from the query, the user select and mark those subjectively declared as more similar to a query. Selected sequences update the weights of radial basis function (RBF) neural network: moving the RBF center towards selected sequences and changing the width of RBF for obtaining fine-tuning. New ranking of audio sequences is then performing from RBF output. The user can repeat the process in iterative way until obtaining satisfactory results. Our simulations show that the process converges very fast: after a few iterations (1 to 4) selected fragments are just those we needed.","doi":"10.1109/EURCON.2005.1629885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURCON.2005.1629885","startPage":"167","endPage":"170","displayPublicationTitle":"EUROCON 2005 - The International Conference on \"Computer as a Tool\"","pdfPath":"/iel5/10849/34189/01629885.pdf","publicationTitle":"EUROCON 2005 - The International Conference on \"Computer as a Tool\"","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying and Retrieving of Audio Sequences by using Wavelet Descriptors and Neural Network with User's Assistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Identifying and Retrieving of Audio Sequences by using Wavelet Descriptors and Neural Network with User's Assistance","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1629885/","accessionNumber":"8914762","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629885/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying and Retrieving of Audio Sequences by using Wavelet Descriptors and Neural Network with User's Assistance","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"01629885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06494S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10849","isNumber":"34189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10849","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34189","articleId":"1629885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1629899,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A crucial property of all approaches is that they have the ability to adapt the controller to accommodate changes in the process. That means that the controller maintains a required level of performance in spite of noise and fluctuation in the process. The paper focuses on model reference adaptive controllers based on Lyapunov adaptive law. The named adaptive controller in some cases has a little level of performance regarding conventional controller. In order to improve the controller performance behavioral cloning and RBF neural network are used. In the behavioral cloning, the system learns from control traces of a human operator. The advantage of the named approach lies in simplicity with regard to the controller parameters tune up in order to reach an appropriate performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629922/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8914337","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1629922/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Control Based on Lyapunov Adaptation Law to be Improved by RBF Neural Network and Behavioral Cloning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Control Based on Lyapunov Adaptation Law to be Improved by RBF Neural Network and Behavioral Cloning","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"01629922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098297S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10849","isNumber":"34189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10849","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34189","articleId":"1629922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1629955,"authors":[{"name":"V.R.

This is achieved through the study, design, implementation and presentation of some initial results, of an OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) transceiver. The design and implementation is done using the TMS320C6713 DSK development kit from \"Texas Instruments Inc\", in conjunction with Matlab-Simulink from \"Mathworks Inc.\". This procedure can easily be adopted for the development of several other systems at the domain of communications and signal processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an OFDM Transceiver Framework Using Matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSK","publicationTitle":"EUROCON 2005 - The International Conference on \"Computer as a Tool\"","doi":"10.1109/EURCON.2005.1629988","displayPublicationTitle":"EUROCON 2005 - The International Conference on \"Computer as a Tool\"","pdfPath":"/iel5/10849/34189/01629988.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURCON.2005.1629988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1629988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1629988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an OFDM Transceiver Framework Using Matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSK","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1629988/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8914399","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an OFDM Transceiver Framework Using Matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSK","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"01629988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054825S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10849","isNumber":"34189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10849","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"34189","articleId":"1629988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"}]
