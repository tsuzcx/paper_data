The pros and cons of both approaches are examined in terms of accuracy, complexity, and usefulness of the achieved models.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","HEMTs","Equivalent circuits","Gallium nitride","Temperature measurement","Microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","neural nets","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","microwave small-signal modelling","equivalent circuit","GaN HEMT small-signal modelling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MIEL.2017.8190090","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 30th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 30th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8166373/8190056/08190090.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIEL.2017.8190090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaN HEMT small-signal modelling: Neural networks versus equivalent circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GaN HEMT small-signal modelling: Neural networks versus equivalent circuit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190090/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8190090/","accessionNumber":"17430480","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaN HEMT small-signal modelling: Neural networks versus equivalent circuit","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"miel2017pxcap153156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056448S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8166373","isNumber":"8190056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8166373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8190056","articleId":"8190090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8190110,"authors":[{"name":"S\u0142awomir Je\u017cewski","affiliation":["College of Social and Media Culture, ul, Institute of Informatics, Toru\u0144, Poland"],"firstName":"S\u0142awomir","lastName":"Je\u017cewski","id":"37727520700"},{"name":"Rafa\u0142 D\u0142ugosz","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunication, UTP University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Rafa\u0142","lastName":"D\u0142ugosz","id":"37298868900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2563-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2561-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2562-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2564-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"8190110","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190110","abstract":"In this paper we focus on the issues of hardware implementation of genetic algorithms (GA) in hardware. In their classic implementation, the genetic algorithms search for a global minimum or maximum of a multidimensional function called the fitness function. If the problem, i.e. the fitness function, is too complex for a brute force search, we can look for a solution based on GA. In this situation we obtain desired results by performing parallel calculations on the \u201cgeneration\u201d of candidate solutions randomly distributed over the input data space. For these candidates we evaluate the fitness function and then we breed a next generation. During breeding we use operators that mimic chromosomal crossing to exchange of features between the candidates, and mutation operations to introduce new features into the population. The literature research shows that more than sixty different crossing algorithms are used with the GA in different purposes. Such a large number of crossing algorithms is a serious problem when developing a hardware solution. In this paper, we are reviewing a deployment of selected crossing operators in specialized hardware.","doi":"10.1109/MIEL.2017.8190110","startPage":"235","endPage":"238","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 30th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8166373/8190056/08190110.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 30th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIEL.2017.8190110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selected aspects and tradeoffs in transistor level implementation of genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Hardware","Biological cells","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","mathematical operators","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transistor level implementation","hardware implementation","genetic algorithms search","global minimum","multidimensional function","fitness function","brute force search","input data space","hardware solution","crossing operators","chromosomal crossing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Selected aspects and tradeoffs in transistor level implementation of genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8190110/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17418919","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selected aspects and tradeoffs in transistor level implementation of genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"miel2017pxcap235238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0659S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8166373","isNumber":"8190056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8166373","xplore-issue":"8190056","articleId":"8190110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8190116,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

as it offers flexible and pay-per-use based services to its customers. Nevertheless, security and privacy are the main challenges to its success due to its dynamic and distributed architecture, resulting in generating big data that should be carefully analysed for detecting network's vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Anomaly Detection Framework (CADF) for detecting cyber attacks from cloud computing environments. We provide the technical functions and deployment of the framework to illustrate its methodology of implementation and installation. The framework is evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset to check its credibility while deploying it in cloud computing environments. The experimental results showed that this framework can easily handle large-scale systems as its implementation requires only estimating statistical measures from network observations. Moreover, the evaluation performance of the framework outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques in terms of false positive rate and detection rate.","publicationTitle":"2017 Military Communications and Information Systems Conference (MilCIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Military Communications and Information Systems Conference (MilCIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8166662/8188553/08190421.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MilCIS.2017.8190421","doi":"10.1109/MilCIS.2017.8190421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8188553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative anomaly detection framework for handling big data of cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative anomaly detection framework for handling big data of cloud computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190421/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8190421/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430490","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative anomaly detection framework for handling big data of cloud computing","confLoc":"Canberra, ACT, Australia","sourcePdf":"021570369467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076978S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8166662","isNumber":"8188553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8166662","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8188553","articleId":"8190421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190560,"authors":[{"name":"Larry G.

We give students things to design - individually or in teams, and then evaluate the products they produce. But another way to learn about engineering design is to study real-world examples. Case studies provide one way to do so. Cases have been used in schools of business for many years; the case study method is the primary approach for MBA programs at schools like Harvard Business School and the Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia. In this special session, we will examine several case studies used in a course Fundamentals of Design Thinking taught at the University of Virginia. These focus on individual engineers and architects as well as the companies they have founded: Dave Kelley (IDEO), Dean Kamen (DEKA), Oliver Kuttner (Edison 2), Bill McDonough (William McDonough + partners), and Evan and Eric Edwards (Kaleo). The cases concern the personalities and motivations of the key players in each organization, the structure and culture of the organization, the types of products designed, and their impact on contemporary society. We will illustrate the use of cases with two examples: one focused on a successful company and the other on a particular product design. Then we will briefly discuss cases concerned with ethical issues, product liability and intellectual property.","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2017.8190560","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8124740/8190427/08190560.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2017.8190560","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Special session: Learning design thinking using engineering case studies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Special session: Learning design thinking using engineering case studies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190560/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8190560/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17496600","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Special session: Learning design thinking using engineering case studies","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"1570341064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046903S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8124740","isNumber":"8190427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8124740","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8190427","articleId":"8190560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8190657,"authors":[{"name":"Abhinav Dixit","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, School of ECEE"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Dixit","id":"37086303043"},{"name":"Sameeksha Katoch","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, School of ECEE"],"firstName":"Sameeksha","lastName":"Katoch","id":"37086298742"},{"name":"Photini Spanias","affiliation":["MLFTC, ASU"],"firstName":"Photini","lastName":"Spanias","id":"37657880300"},{"name":"Mahesh Banavar","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Clarkson University"],"firstName":"Mahesh","lastName":"Banavar","id":"38228384300"},{"name":"Huan Song","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, School of ECEE"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Song","id":"37086299561"},{"name":"Andreas Spanias","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, School of ECEE"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Spanias","id":"37279657300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5920-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5919-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4920-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190657","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Java","Browsers","Hardware","Real-time systems","Education","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","digital signal processing chips","digital simulation","electronic engineering computing","electronic engineering education","graphical user interfaces","Internet","Java","laboratories","mobile computing","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time interfaces","sensor boards","mobile phones","interactive graphical user interface","hardware experiences","DSP classes","mobile platforms","Java environment","HTML5 framework","simulation environment","educational experience","signal processing online labs","web-based signal processing simulation packages","J-DSP online laboratory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal Processing","HTML5","Web 4.0 Engineering Education","sensor interfaces","real-time online labs"]}],"abstract":"Several web-based signal processing simulation packages for education have been developed in a Java environment.

Knowledge and skills required for cyber defence can be developed and exercised by lectures and lab sessions, or by active learning, which is seen as a promising and attractive alternative. In this paper, we present experience gained from the preparation and execution of cyber defence exercises involving various participants in a cyber range. The exercises follow a Red vs. Blue team format, in which the Red team conducts malicious activities against emulated networks and systems that have to be defended by Blue teams of learners. Although this exercise format is popular and used worldwide by numerous organizers in practice, it has been sparsely researched. We contribute to the topic by describing the general exercise life cycle, covering the exercise's development, dry run, execution, evaluation, and repetition. Each phase brings several challenges that exercise organizers have to deal with. We present lessons learned that can help organizers to prepare, run and repeat successful events systematically, with lower effort and costs, and avoid a trial-and-error approach that is often used.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2017.8190713","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8124740/8190427/08190713.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2017.8190713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lessons learned from complex hands-on defence exercises in a cyber range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Lessons learned from complex hands-on defence exercises in a cyber range","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8190713/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17418616","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190713/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lessons learned from complex hands-on defence exercises in a cyber range","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"1570339415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05647S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8124740","isNumber":"8190427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8124740","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8190427","articleId":"8190713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8190755,"authors":[{"name":"Yo-Seb Jeon","affiliation":["Future IT Innovation Laboratory, POSTECH, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, Korea"],"firstName":"Yo-Seb","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37085625220"},{"name":"Hwan-Seok Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, Korea"],"firstName":"Hwan-Seok","lastName":"Ku","id":"37086308731"},{"name":"Namyoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, Korea"],"firstName":"Namyoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37403846100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190755","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","MIMO","Array signal processing","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user grouping method","in-group users","FDD massive MIMO systems","frequency-division-duplexing massive multiple-input multiple-output system","two-stage beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint spatial division and multiplexing","two-stage beamforming","large scale MIMO","precoding"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a frequency-division-duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system that operates with two-stage beamforming based on user grouping.

The proposed first stage beamformer maximizes an approximate sum rate calculated from the second-order statistic of the channels.

In the proposed technique, each BS first generates M BF matrices with a pseudo-random manner and each mobile station (MS) opportunistically feeds back the received signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) ratio for each random beam to its home-cell BS. Then, each BS selects MSs for each beam based on the feedback information, and it also feeds back the achievable sum-rate for M BF matrices to a BS coordinator via wired backhaul links. Finally, the BS coordinator determines the optimal BF matrix that maximizes the sum-rate over the network, and sends the index of the optimal BF matrix to BSs. Each BS sends data to MSs by using the optimal BF matrix among M BF matrices. Main results indicate that there exists a trade-off between the feedback overhead and the achievable sum-rate, but the sum-rate of the proposed technique with opportunistic feedback approaches to that with full feedback as the number of MSs in each cell increases.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190757","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190757.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190757","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","startPage":"447","endPage":"449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-cell pseudo-random beamforming: Opportunistic feedback and beam selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-cell pseudo-random beamforming: Opportunistic feedback and beam selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190757/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8190757/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430066","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-cell pseudo-random beamforming: Opportunistic feedback and beam selection","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"IP25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077149S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190764,"authors":[{"name":"Donggi Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Donggi","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37086281712"},{"name":"Minjin Baek","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Minjin","lastName":"Baek","id":"37086284391"},{"name":"Sang-Sun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Sun","lastName":"Lee","id":"38559827400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190764","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Hidden Markov models","Predictive models","Roads","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","road safety","road traffic","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural network","host vehicle","road traffic safety","physics-based motion models","kinematic models","dynamic models","long-term prediction","vehicle trajectory prediction","future location prediction","DNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Trajectory prediction","vehicle navigation","deep neural network","intelligent vehicles"]}],"abstract":"Accurate prediction of the future locations of the host vehicle as well as that of the surrounding objects is one of the key challenges in improving road traffic safety.

While small path loss of near-field magnetic communication enables effective implementation of implantable devices, it is difficult to support high-rate applications. In this regard, many of previous works attempted to overcome this problem by applying the MIMO technology. However, their suggestions still have challenging issues such as crosstalk cancellation and the limitations in expanding channel streams. In this work, we attempt to overcome such problems by exploiting the coil array for near-field magnetic MIMO system with crosstalk cancellation between array components. To be specific, we propose a scalable non-coupling coil array that can expand channel streams as much as user's requirement. In particular, we present the specific structure of proposed scalable non-coupling coil array and also demonstrate its validity.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190771","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","startPage":"750","endPage":"752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-field magnetic MIMO communication for implantable devices using scalable non-coupling coil array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-field magnetic MIMO communication for implantable devices using scalable non-coupling coil array","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190771/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430069","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8190771/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-field magnetic MIMO communication for implantable devices using scalable non-coupling coil array","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054222S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190778,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Kyu Park","affiliation":["Department of Digital Media Design and Applications, Seoul Women's Univ., Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Kyu","lastName":"Park","id":"37086227725"},{"name":"Jaeho Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering UNIST, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37073215100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190778","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":701},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190778","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning algorithms","Bandwidth","Operating systems","Detectors","Benchmark testing","Prediction algorithms","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","learning (artificial intelligence)","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["garbage collection overhead","SSD","machine learning algorithms","GC overhead","operating system level","machine learning technique","GC detecting mechanism","mechanism performance variance","GC-detector","low performance variance","TRIM operations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Garbage Collection","Machine Learning","SSD","TRIM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we attempt to manage GC overhead at the operating system level.

Since it is inevitable to use HPA to obtain sufficient transmission power for high-speed communication, it is necessary to compensate for nonlinearity of HPA by using a predistorter. In this paper, we analyze performance of multi-level modulation technique(M-ary) using HPA using Saleh nonlinear model in basic communication system based on M-QAM modulation with good power and spectral efficiency. In addition, a predistorter was used to compensate for the nonlinearity of the HPA, and the nonlinear distortion was compensated using HPA. As a result of the simulation, the output signal amplitude characteristics(AM-AM) and the output signal phase characteristics(AM-PM) with respect to the magnitude of the input signal are checked for the magnitude of the input signal, And the nonlinearity of HPA was compensated for. Also, by checking the BER performance, BER performance similar to that of the ideal linear amplifier can be obtained by using the predistorter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Mathematical model","Modulation","Predistortion","Analytical models","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","nonlinear distortion","power amplifiers","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear high power amplifier","bit error rate","BER","output signal amplitude characteristics","nonlinear distortion","Saleh nonlinear model","high-speed communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["16-QAM","HPA nonlinearity","Saleh model","Predistorter","Linearization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190817","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190817.pdf","startPage":"931","endPage":"934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum characteristics and predistortion gain in the nonlinear high power amplifier(HPA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum characteristics and predistortion gain in the nonlinear high power amplifier(HPA)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190817/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8190817/","accessionNumber":"17429969","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum characteristics and predistortion gain in the nonlinear high power amplifier(HPA)","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041809S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8190819,"authors":[{"name":"Gil-Mo Kang","affiliation":["Soongsil University, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Gil-Mo","lastName":"Kang"},{"name":"Hyeon Min Kim","affiliation":["Soongsil University, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Hyeon Min","lastName":"Kim"},{"name":"Yoan Shin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Korea"],"firstName":"Yoan","lastName":"Shin","id":"37279496500"},{"name":"Oh-Soon Shin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Korea"],"firstName":"Oh-Soon","lastName":"Shin","id":"37271728500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190819","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Simulation","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","codes","message passing","multi-access systems","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","QR-MPA detection scheme","SCMA receiver","low-complexity message passing algorithm detector","sparse codewords","multidimensional codebook","nonorthogonal multiple access scheme","sparse code multiple access","SCMA system","QR decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-complexity detection","message passing algorithm (MPA)","multiple antennas","QR decomposition","sparse code multiple access (SCMA)"]}],"abstract":"Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a nonorthogonal multiple access scheme based on a multi-dimensional codebook with sparse codewords. The sparsity property of SCMA allows the receiver to take advantage of low-complexity message passing algorithm (MPA) detector with maximum likelihood (ML)-like performance. The use of multiple antennas at the SCMA receiver will improve the detection performance of the MPA at the expense of an increase in complexity. To reduce the complexity of the MPA, we propose an MPA detection scheme based on QR decomposition, referred to as QR-MPA detection, for an SCMA system with multiple antennas. The proposed QR-MPA detection scheme achieves performance close to the optimal MPA performance by converting the factor graph into two subgraphs through QR decomposition and exchanging a posterior probabilities between subgraphs in a circular manner. Simulation results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed QR-MPA detection scheme with that of the conventional MPA detection scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Message passing algorithm based on QR decomposition for an SCMA system with multiple antennas","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190819","startPage":"941","endPage":"944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190819.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Message passing algorithm based on QR decomposition for an SCMA system with multiple antennas","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8190819/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430197","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message passing algorithm based on QR decomposition for an SCMA system with multiple antennas","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056629S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190820,"authors":[{"name":"Ishtiaq Ahmad","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Ishtiaq","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37086125205"},{"name":"KyungHi Chang","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"KyungHi","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292347500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190820","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel models","Multiplexing","Throughput","Antennas","Delays","MIMO","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","marine communication","MIMO communication","mobile communication","protocols","telecommunication network reliability","time division multiple access","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO transmit diversity","multiplexing techniques","ship ad-hoc networks","maritime channel model","VHF data exchange system","wireless transmission protocols","maritime mobile services","maritime communications","ITU-R M.1842-1","VHF data link protocols","SANET","TDMA frame structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ITU-R M.1842-1","SANET","VDES","Diversity","Multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"ITU-R M.1842-1, which is one of the renowned specification for VHF data exchange system (VDES) devoted to maritime mobile applications, has been standardized wireless transmission protocols according to the peculiar characteristics of a maritime communications scenario.

We first investigate the standard MAB problems where a single player either explores an arm to gather information to improve its decision strategy, or exploits the arm based on the information that it has collected at each round. Then, we study the taxonomy of combinatorial MAB problems, in particular for multi-player scenarios with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) rewards.

Such a network is extremely useful in emergency scenarios. In such a network, the mobility of UAVs is minimal. We consider the placement of the SDN controller and its implications in terms of communication overhead and end-to-end delay of the control packets exchanged between the UAVs and the controller. We also propose a scheme for reducing the overhead caused by the control packets, sent by each forwarding element (UAV) to the controller. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using ns-2. Simulation results show that the controller should be placed in a central location to minimize the number of hops and hence reduce the delay experienced by control packets. Moreover, simulation results show that a tradeoff exists between control packet overhead and their end-to-end delay. Attempting to reduce the overhead causes the end-to-end delay to increase.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190924.pdf","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1292","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deployment of an SDN-based UAV network: Controller placement and tradeoff between control overhead and delay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Network topology","Merging","Simulation","Software defined networking","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","remotely operated vehicles","software defined networking","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controller placement","control overhead","communication service","SDN controller","communication overhead","end-to-end delay","control packets","control packet overhead","SDN-based UAV network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SDN","UAV Network","physical deploment","SDN controller placement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deployment of an SDN-based UAV network: Controller placement and tradeoff between control overhead and delay","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8190924/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430098","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deployment of an SDN-based UAV network: Controller placement and tradeoff between control overhead and delay","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063538S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190925,"authors":[{"name":"Luiggi Cantos","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Luiggi","lastName":"Cantos","id":"37086852382"},{"name":"Gerardo Sacarelo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Gerardo","lastName":"Sacarelo","id":"37085907371"},{"name":"Yeonjin Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Yeonjin","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37086129272"},{"name":"Yun Hee Kim","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Yun Hee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280921800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190925","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190925","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Optimization","Antennas","Receivers","Wireless communication","Energy harvesting","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","energy harvesting","inductive power transmission","MIMO communication","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear model","imperfect channel state information","wireless power transfer system","multiple antennas","multicarrier signal waveforms","CSIT","energy harvesting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation errors","energy harvesting","multiple Antennas","wireless power transfer","waveform design"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a wireless power transfer system with multiple antennas by using the multicarrier signal waveforms.

MEC servers are located in close proximity to users, enabling users to seamlessly access services running on edge facilities. However, capacity and bandwidth constraints of MEC servers limit the number of services to be deployed. Therefore, an important problem is how to allocate services properly within capacity and bandwidth constraints, which is known as an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we focus on the services allocation problem in MEC and try to find trade-offs between average network delay and load balance. With temporal locality information, we allocate services by Pareto-based optimal k-Medoids and generate approximate optimal service allocation policies. In our simulation environment, compared with some traditional heuristic algorithms, our approach can reduce the variance of the load on MEC servers by 18.9% with nearly same network delay.","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190951.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic service allocation algorithm in mobile edge computing","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190951","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic service allocation algorithm in mobile edge computing","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430126","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8190951/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic service allocation algorithm in mobile edge computing","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124379S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190952,"authors":[{"name":"Changyoung An","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea"],"firstName":"Changyoung","lastName":"An","id":"37085373714"},{"name":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea"],"firstName":"Heung-Gyoon","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37278285300"},{"name":"Yingshan Li","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yingshan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086327290"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Asharif","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Engineering, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Asharif","id":"37395372300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190952","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NW-OFDM system","eMBB new radio waveform","5G mobile communication system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","NW1-OFDM system","NW2-OFDM system","5G mobile system","enhanced mobile broadband radio","frequency resource","weighted overlap and add orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","improved WOLA-OFDM","new windowing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["new waveform","WOLA-OFDM","NW-OFDM","window function","cyclic postfix"]}],"abstract":"For the eMBB (enhanced mobile broadband) new radio waveform of the 5G and beyond 5G mobile communication system, the spectrum efficiency is the most important figure of merit. Especially, OOB (out-of-band) power spectrum must be reduced to increase the spectrum efficiency and to save the frequency resources. Filtering is the one way to get the sharp OOB spectrum. But, due to the very complicated process and some difficulty to the realization, windowing method has been enlightened than the filtering. WOLA-OFDM (weighted overlap and add - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) system is the most representative windowing method. However, the WOLA-OFDM system has some serious problem. It has the overlap process in order not to lose the time resource. Due to the overlap of the 2 extensions of copy and addition processes, the left part of the copied and added parts will invade into the right part of the previous OFDM symbol. This is very serious data collision even before the transmission. So, in this paper, to improve the WOLA-OFDM system and to avoid this problem of WOLA-OFDM between the consecutive OFDM symbols, we like to propose an NW-OFDM (new windowing - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) that uses cyclic postfix and windowing. In this NW-OFDM system there are NW1-OFDM system and NW2-OFDM system, whether the overlapping between the consecutive OFDM symbols is allowed or not. Compared with the conventional WOLA-OFDM system, the proposed NW-OFDM system is simplified and solve the data collision problem, Simulations results show that the proposed NW-OFDM system has comparable OOB spectrum reduction characteristics and can be designed by simple some modification from the conventional OFDM system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NW-OFDM using cyclic postfix and windowing for the eMBB waveform of the 5G/B5G mobile system","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190952","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190952.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"NW-OFDM using cyclic postfix and windowing for the eMBB waveform of the 5G/B5G mobile system","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8190952/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430059","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NW-OFDM using cyclic postfix and windowing for the eMBB waveform of the 5G/B5G mobile system","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038632S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190954,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Bae Seo","affiliation":["Dept.

Most of the previous researches concentrate to specific sub-topic of image deconvolution or generative image deconvolution models with a strong assumption. However, our network restores visual data from distorted images applied multiple dominant degradation problems such as noise, blur, saturation, compression without any prior information. As a generator, we leverage convolutional neural networks based ODCNN [12] which perform generalized image deconvolution with a decent performance, and we use VGGNet [11] to distinguish true/fake of an input image as a discriminator. We devise the loss function of the generator of GAN-D which combines mean square error (MSE) of network output and ground-truth images to traditional adversarial loss of GAN. This loss function and the presence of discriminator reinforces the generator to produce more high-quality images than the original model structured with a single convolutional neural network. During experiments with four datasets, we find that our network has higher PSNR/SSIM values and qualitative results than ODCNN.","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190958.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190958","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GAN-D: Generative adversarial networks for image deconvolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GAN-D: Generative adversarial networks for image deconvolution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190958/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8190958/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430055","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GAN-D: Generative adversarial networks for image deconvolution","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050923S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190961,"authors":[{"name":"Wonjun Choi","affiliation":["Department of Information Infrastructure, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Daejeon, Rep. of Korea"],"firstName":"Wonjun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37086329960"},{"name":"Jayhoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information Infrastructure, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Daejeon, Rep. of Korea"],"firstName":"Jayhoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086329765"},{"name":"Soonyoung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information Infrastructure, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Daejeon, Rep. of Korea"],"firstName":"Soonyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086326769"},{"name":"Jeonghwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information Infrastructure, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Daejeon, Rep. of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeonghwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086329738"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190961","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Metadata","Machine learning","Support vector machines","Hardware","Neural networks","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","classification","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","meta data","recurrent neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RNN","4th Industrial Revolution","deep learning method","Internet of Things","reference metadata classification","reference literature","related techniques","big data","favorite technique","artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Metadata","Classification","Machine Learning","Big Data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190961","abstract":"Recently, various technologies related to the 4th Industrial Revolution (cloud, Big Data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, etc.) have become issues and deep learning has become a favorite technique for big data and the studies using related techniques have been conducted on astronomy, physics, Science, and statistical analysis.

In iterative MIMO decoder, the complexity can be major obstacle for practical implementation. The soft interference cancellation-minimum mean squared error (SIC-MMSE) approach for detection is considered as a feasible approach due to its complexity-performance tradeoff. In this paper, we show the performance of a SIC-MMSE detection scheme for MIMO system, where three iterative loops are utilized. We employ a single matrix inversion method to reduce complexity, while the third loop inside MIMO detector is employed to improve the reliability of the symbol estimation to enhance the performance. Simulation results demonstrates that the proposed method produces comparable error-rate performance as the conventional schemes with much less complexity.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190971","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190971.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity reduced MIMO detection with three iterative loops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190971/","displayDocTitle":"Complexity reduced MIMO detection with three iterative loops","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430091","htmlLink":"/document/8190971/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity reduced MIMO detection with three iterative loops","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062601S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190972,"authors":[{"name":"Rei Kawai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Rei","lastName":"Kawai","id":"37086274865"},{"name":"Hiroshi Oguma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Oguma","id":"37285904100"},{"name":"Suguru Kameda","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Suguru","lastName":"Kameda","id":"37300149000"},{"name":"Noriharu Suematsu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriharu","lastName":"Suematsu","id":"37298359500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190972","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Synchronization","Delays","Global Positioning System","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","electronic messaging","field programmable gate arrays","Global Positioning System","satellite communication","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Spread-Spectrum Code-Division Multiple-Access communication","short message communication system","QuasiZenith Satellite System","safety confirmation system","satellite reception timing","high-density user multiple access","Global Positioning System","transmission timing control system","QZSS short message synchronized SS-CDMA communication","Field Programmable Gate Array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Satellite Communication","Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)","Global Positioning System (GPS)","Spread Spectrum (SS)","Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA)","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)"]}],"abstract":"We have proposed synchronized Spread-Spectrum Code-Division Multiple-Access (SS-CDMA) communication for location and short message communication system using Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) as a safety confirmation system at the time of grade disaster.

Received Signal Strength (RSS) is a parameter of the power level that being received by the radio which can be used to track the location of the devices. This paper evaluates the localization of ZigBee devices which uses RSS fingerprinting by artificial neural networks. The RSS data processing by neural networks uses two types of training algorithms, i.e. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and Resilient Backpropagation algorithm. The performance of these two algorithms is evaluated. The experiment result shows that the RSS fingerprinting method is able to accurately predict the location of tracked ZigBee devices.

Currently, QKD systems can be categorized by its source of uncertainty in nature; single photon or coherent light. As coherent light is harnessed, the overall cost for composing systems drops in general. However, more elaborate post processing is required to extract and share errorless secret keys. Such process is called reconciliation, which is critical to performance. To extend the maximum distance to distill secret keys and prevent it from being bottleneck, we propose a reconciliation protocol that combines multidimensional reconciliation and polar codes. Especially, considering some practical issues, Gaussian approximation is chosen to construct polar codes. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol can support decent performance of coherent-light-based systems at long distance with reduced complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Gaussian approximation","Security","Maximum likelihood decoding","Computers","Detectors","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","private key cryptography","quantum cryptography","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar codes","Gaussian approximation","continuous-variable quantum key distribution","QKD systems","errorless secret keys","reconciliation protocol","multidimensional reconciliation","coherent-light-based systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CV-QKD","reconciliation","polar codes","polar code construction","Gaussian approximation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8190991","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190991","startPage":"301","endPage":"306","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08190991.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8190991/","displayDocTitle":"Reconciliation with polar codes constructed using Gaussian approximation for long-distance continuous-variable quantum key distribution","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430170","htmlLink":"/document/8190991/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconciliation with polar codes constructed using Gaussian approximation for long-distance continuous-variable quantum key distribution","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065345S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8190991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8190993,"authors":[{"name":"Euitaek Lee","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Euitaek","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086322490"},{"name":"Jinyoup Ahn","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jinyoup","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37086054156"},{"name":"Namik Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Namik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086059433"},{"name":"Kwang Bok Lee","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Kwang Bok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281491600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8190993","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint activity detection and channel estimation via Bayesian orthogonal matching pursuit","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel method to jointly estimate the activities and channel coefficients of devices in massive machine-type communications (mMTC) systems.

In this paper, we mathematically analyze both throughput and energy efficiency (EE) of CS in a multi-cell downlink network where the users are non-uniformly distributed in each hexagonal cell. We assume that the number of users are generated according to Poisson point process (PPP) in each cell, and thus the number of users may change for each cell. If there exists no user in a particular cell, then the base station (BS) of the cell is assumed to be turned-off for improving EE. In the multi-cell network, each BS with CS selects the user having the largest CDF value of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We show that both throughput and EE of CS in the multi-cell network increase as the user density increases and they also increase as users tend to exist nearer to the BS. CS obviously outperforms the round-robin (RR) scheduling in terms of both throughput and EE. The analysis is validated with extensive computer simulations. To the best of our knowledge, the mathematical analysis of the CS in the multi-cell network with non-uniform user distribution has not been provided so far.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8191009","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08191009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8191009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","startPage":"388","endPage":"392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On CDF-based scheduling with non-uniform user distribution in multi-cell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8191009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On CDF-based scheduling with non-uniform user distribution in multi-cell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8191009/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430190","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8191009/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On CDF-based scheduling with non-uniform user distribution in multi-cell networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109779S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8191009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8191020,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hoon Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Hoon","lastName":"Oh","id":"37086023448"},{"name":"Jong-Mu Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Mu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085864571"},{"name":"Jae-Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281196200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8191020","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium","Adaptive systems","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","satellite communication","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application layer","link layer","positioning information","temporarily disconnected satellite network user","disruptive satellite communication","temporal communication disconnection","satellite terminals","resource allocation mechanism","cross-layer information exchange","adaptive borrow-repay resource allocation","satellite communication on the move","TCP throughput","SOTM node"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance Enhancing Proxy","Cross-Layer","Positioning Information","Number of Sessions"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive borrow-repay resource allocation uses the positioning information when temporal communication disconnection is expected.

In this paper, we allocate one SU as a sensor for sensing in the interference-based CR, and the remaining SUs are removed after being limited by the interference in the received signal space of the sensor. Then, a system is proposed in which the sensor can detect the signal of the PU in the remaining received signal space. In the proposed system, the sensor must determine the period of reporting the sensing results. For this, the reward is defined as interference ratio, loss ratio, and system load according to sensing result reply time. Using Q-learning, reinforcement learning, the sensing length and reporting period can be dynamically determined in an ever-changing environment. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in terms of interference ratio, loss ratio, and reward considering system load, compared to the case where the sensing length and reporting period are fixed at -12 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8191022/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17430160","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8191022/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement learning for dynamic sensing parameter control in cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement learning for dynamic sensing parameter control in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054012S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8191022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8191023,"authors":[{"name":"Mousumi Haque","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering Saitama University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Mousumi","lastName":"Haque","id":"37086309548"},{"name":"Tetsuya Shimamura","affiliation":["Information Technology Center Saitama University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Shimamura","id":"37271969400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8191023","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","OFDM","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","Finite impulse response filters","Wireless communication","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["severe noise environments","comb filter","autocorrelator","cognitive radio systems","intelligent system","modern wireless communication systems","semiblind spectrum sensing method","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM transmitted signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Spectrum Sensing","Autocorrelation Function","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8191023","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8191023","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is an intelligent system for designing modern wireless communication systems.

Numerical results show BER performances for the AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels and that the diamond constellation has the lowest PAPR.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2017.8191034","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125636/8190740/08191034.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2017.8191034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8190740","startPage":"530","endPage":"535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-gray coding scheme for a (3\u00d72<sup>2m'+1</sup>)-ary QAM with two-time dimensions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8191034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-gray coding scheme for a (3\u00d72<sup>2m'+1</sup>)-ary QAM with two-time dimensions","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8191034/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430230","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8191034/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-gray coding scheme for a (3\u00d72<sup>2m'+1</sup>)-ary QAM with two-time dimensions","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087552S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125636","isNumber":"8190740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125636","xplore-issue":"8190740","articleId":"8191034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8191036,"authors":[{"name":"Daeyoung Park","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Daeyoung","lastName":"Park","id":"37086191961"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4032-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4033-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8191036","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":448},"abstract":"We consider an antenna selection scheme in single-user massive MIMO systems.

Especially, we design a channel reselection algorithm, where the optimum channels are used to convey mission critical applications.

The software tools generally adopted for analytical studies are not suitable for the calculation of the arc-fault incident energy in the presence of capacitor banks.

The frequency of the outburst current from a capacitor bank is determined by the size of the capacitors and the impedance of the conductors connecting the capacitor bank to the fault.

Using communications between energy storage devices in the system, primary and secondary voltage/frequency control are achieved. The primary voltage and frequency synchronization is achieved by equally sharing the active and reactive powers among energy storage devices. The secondary voltage and frequency restoration is achieved by selecting one energy storage as a virtual leader, and other energy storage devices will act as followers to follow the leader energy storage system. The uniqueness of the proposed consensus design is the use of nominal values of grid voltage and frequency instead of their measured values.

In these systems, the electric current entering into the grid is supposed to fulfill the IEEE criteria, so that high quality of power with less distortion is transported. Due to this, low pass filters like L, LC or LCL are applied by means of the inverter to minimize the harmonics getting into the grid. LCL filters are generally employed because of their functioning in filtering capability but they bring in resonance and unstableness. Therefore damping is carried out by applying controllers in the circuit to decrease the resonance in the system. In this paper, to suppress resonance, Proportional Resonant - Derivative (PR-D) controller is designed to check self-reliant action of proportional, resonant and derivative controllers. PR-D controller is compared with existing two degree of freedom controller (2DOF) and the system functioning is validated in a MATLAB platform. The simulation results exhibit that PR-D controller admits meliorate resonance damping & constancy when compared with the two degree of freedom damping.

The predictive models can be deployed to improve the planning and operation of renewable systems and can improve the power purchase process and bring several advantages to the power utilities. The irradiance is affected by several factors, such as clouds and dust, and it becomes challenging for physical models to predict and capture the dynamics. The statistical methods are commonly used to predict the irradiance. These methods include autoregressive moving average, support vector machine, and artificial neural network. Deficiencies and challenges of existing methods include low prediction accuracy, low scalability for big data, and inability to capture long-term dependencies. In this paper, a deep recurrent neural network is used to predict the solar irradiance. Deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) is an artificial neural network with more hidden layers to improve the complexity of the model and enable the extraction of high-level features. The neural network is trained, tested, and validated using real data from the National Resources in Canada. The simulation and experimental results are compared to other methods to illustrate the advantages using the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICRERA.2017.8191206","startPage":"988","endPage":"994","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications

the operation behavior and the structure. A microgrid can be treated as a small electric grid that contains consisted of numerous residential loads, energy storage units, and distributed energy. The goal of implementing microgrids is to supply power to homes even in the event of an electric grid outage. That is, the stored energy in the storage unit and distributed generation will supply energy to the load until the main grid return to the normal operation, and therefore, supply power to the load and store energy back to the storage unit. This method allows decentralization of the electric grid regarding control and energy supply. To deal with decentralized systems, one needs to construe the electric grid as a system of systems (SoS), and use models that can capture the dynamics of the microgrid. This paper presents a model of microgrid using feedforward neural networks. This model can be utilized in complex system modeling techniques such as agent-based approaches and system dynamics, or a combination of various methods to represent different electric elements. An example of modeling real microgrid is presented to demonstrate the emergent characteristics of the interconnected system. Simulation results and waveforms are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICRERA.2017.8191208","pdfPath":"/iel7/8124738/8191069/08191208.pdf","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1006","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRERA.2017.8191208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8191069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and simulation of a microgrid using feedforward neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8191208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and simulation of a microgrid using feedforward neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17418594","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8191208/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and simulation of a microgrid using feedforward neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"315ModelingandAlzahrani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059925S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8124738","isNumber":"8191069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8124738","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8191069","articleId":"8191208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8191212,"authors":[{"name":"Bruna N. de Andrade","affiliation":["Federal University of Bahia, Bahia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Bruna N.","lastName":"de Andrade","id":"37086317836"},{"name":"Luiz H.S.

A new characteristic mode has been enabled at about 900 MHz due to this modification. In order to obtain characteristic mode at further lower frequency, the newly attached metal strip is meandered. A shift in the characteristic mode has been observed due to this. Afterwards, Dual antenna design is proposed. The Dual antenna consists of metal strip antenna and coupled antenna. The feeding method is proposed with the help of theory of characteristic mode (TCM) to excite the antenna chassis mode and metal strip mode efficiently.

Driver supposes required to identify the object in front of the vehicle and need to understand the causes of accidents and trouble in vehicle control. Now a day with the increasing traffic conditions, possibility for accidents is increased in a large space because driver is unable to detect themselves the type of fatigue condition they are suffering while driving. So the reason we are going to develop the system which always monitors driver's to avoid accidents in real time. This paper describes dissimilar methods existing for detecting the crisis of driver vigilance and then with comparison of all also chooses best system out of those accessible. As of comparison with all existing methods we have implemented a device which always monitors driver vigilance in real-time using computer vision system which consist of main components as, Raspberry Pi which is specially designed for hardware platform, video camera, and the alarm system for alerting.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Instrumentation and Communication Engineering (ICEICE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168203/8191840/08191851.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Instrumentation and Communication Engineering (ICEICE)","doi":"10.1109/ICEICE.2017.8191851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEICE.2017.8191851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8191840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8191851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A review paper on monitoring driver distraction in real time using computer vision system","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accident prevention","alarm systems","computer vision","driver information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fatigue condition","vehicle control","driver vigilance","computer vision system","alarm system","driver distraction","traffic conditions","Raspberry Pi"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver Monitoring classification","recognition","fatigue Condition","Raspberry pi","image processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8191851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"A review paper on monitoring driver distraction in real time using computer vision system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8191851/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17431030","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"27-28 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A review paper on monitoring driver distraction in real time using computer vision system","confLoc":"Karur, India","sourcePdf":"AnkitaSKulkarni.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048019S","chronDate":"27-28 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168203","isNumber":"8191840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168203","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8191840","articleId":"8191851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8191862,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is also an important subsystem in digital system design. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is one of the most important components of any system and is used in many appliances like calculators, cell phones, and computers. A 32-bit ALU was designed using Verilog HDL with the logical gates such as AND and OR for each one bit ALU circuit. The design was implemented in Xilinx. It can work fast than the ALU processor using less power. The design of an ALU and a Cache memory for use in a high performance processor was examined. Reversible logic vital in recent years because it has ability to reduce the power dissipation which is main requirement in low power design. ALU which are designed using non reversible logic gates consume more power. So there is a need for lesser power consumption and the reversible logic has been playing vital role during recent years for low power VLSI Design techniques. This technique helps in reducing power consumption and power dissipation. This paper presents an implementation of ALU based on reversible logic while comparing it to an ALU architecture with the normal logic gates. All the modules are simulated in modelsim SE 6.4c and synthesised using Xilinx ISE 14.5. ALU which is designed using non reversible logic gates consume more power of about 0.312 mw and the implementation of ALU based on reversible logic reduces the power consumption during operations to about 5.1 percentages.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Instrumentation and Communication Engineering (ICEICE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168203/8191840/08191959.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Instrumentation and Communication Engineering (ICEICE)","doi":"10.1109/ICEICE.2017.8191959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEICE.2017.8191959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8191840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8191959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of FPGA based 32 bit ALU using reversible gates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware design languages","Hardware","Computers","Power dissipation","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","integrated circuit design","logic circuits","logic design","logic gates","low-power electronics","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ALU processor","reversible logic vital","power dissipation","low power design","nonreversible logic gates","ALU architecture","normal logic gates","reversible gates","arithmetic function","logical function","digital system design","logical gates","ALU circuit","power consumption","arithmetic logic unit","low power VLSI design techniques","word length 32.0 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reversible gate","Verilog Hardware Description Language","Feynman gate","Peres gate","Toffoli gate","Fredkin gate","Arithmetic Logic Unit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8191959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of FPGA based 32 bit ALU using reversible gates","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8191959/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17431013","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"27-28 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of FPGA based 32 bit ALU using reversible gates","confLoc":"Karur, India","sourcePdf":"SwamynathanSM.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039495S","chronDate":"27-28 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168203","isNumber":"8191840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168203","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8191840","articleId":"8191959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8191960,"authors":[{"name":"Swapnil B Kadam","affiliation":["D Y Patil College of Engg. and Technology, Kolhapur"],"firstName":"Swapnil B","lastName":"Kadam","id":"37086290224"},{"name":"S K Shirgave","affiliation":["DKTE's college of Engineering & Technology, Ichalkaranji"],"firstName":"S K","lastName":"Shirgave","id":"37086288920"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4996-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5921-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8191960","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"abstract":"When we work in a large scale network, number of problems arises, the total time required to deal with these type of problems depends on how severe the problem is?

The fuzzy controllers are widely used in the recent years due to their results in both tracking and perturbation rejection, however the most difficult step in designing a fuzzy controller is the fuzzyficaion stage where we have to determine the rules and the shape of membership functions. To overcome the problem an improved genetic algorithm is developed to determine the optimal rule and membership functions that are used in the supervisory controller to find Kp, Ki and Kd of the PID controller.

We have chosen this part in order to contribute to the diagnosis of electrical machines. The raising of stator current allows detecting the fatigue of the machine failure. The manner of the treatment decides the efficiency of the applied technique. We have examined the static eccentricity fault by a vibration signal analysis. Motor vibration signature analysis (MVSA) is a large part for detecting faults in electric machines. The use of motor current signature analysis (MCSA) gives adequate information about the fault type. In this paper, the fast Fourier transforms (MCSA-FFT) and the discrete wavelet transform (MCSA-DWT) are applied to analyze the stator current. In this study a comparison has been made between the three methods which we have used to arrive at a good decision about a static eccentricity fault. In this present paper, experimental results were analyzed under a healthy and faulty machine.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125121/8191962/08192035.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","doi":"10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8191962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static eccentricity fault detection of induction motors using MVSA, MCSA and discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibrations","Circuit faults","Rotors","Induction motors","Harmonic analysis","Stators","Air gaps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","discrete wavelet transforms","fast Fourier transforms","fault diagnosis","induction motors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","mechanical faults","electrical machines","machine failure","vibration signal analysis","motor vibration signature analysis","MVSA","electric machines","motor current signature analysis","fast Fourier transforms","MCSA-FFT","MCSA-DWT","stator current","static eccentricity fault detection","discrete wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["air gap eccentricity fault","discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","motor current signature analysis (MCSA)","spectrum analysis (FFT)","motor vibration signature analysis (MVSA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Static eccentricity fault detection of induction motors using MVSA, MCSA and discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8192035/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429701","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static eccentricity fault detection of induction motors using MVSA, MCSA and discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","confLoc":"Boumerdes, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Bessouspaper85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.180475S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125121","isNumber":"8191962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125121","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8191962","articleId":"8192035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192080,"authors":[{"name":"Fatma Zohra Dekhandji","affiliation":["Laboratory signals and systems, University of Boumerdes Avenue de I'ind\u00e9pendance, Boumerdes, Algeria"],"firstName":"Fatma Zohra","lastName":"Dekhandji","id":"37086291088"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0686-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0685-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0687-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192080","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"abstract":"With the growing use of sensitive and susceptive electronic and computing equipment, power quality is foreseen to cause a great concern to electric utilities. The best analysis on power quality is vital to provide better service to customers. Disturbances in power system usually produce continuity changes in the power signal. Wavelet transform is particularly useful in detecting discontinuities in signals, and this makes it appropriate for detection of disturbances in power quality. Wavelet transform is proposed to detect and identify the power quality disturbance at its instance of occurrence. Power quality disturbances are sag, swell, interruption, transient and harmonic. This study reviews various kinds of power quality disturbances with the goal of detecting them using wavelet transform. The results show clearly various forms of changes in amplitude and frequency of the signals. The application shows that this method is fast, sensitive, and practical for detection and identification of power quality disturbance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125121/8191962/08192080.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","doi":"10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8191962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of power quality disturbances using discrete wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Power quality","Continuous wavelet transforms","Multiresolution analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","power supply quality","power system harmonics","power system transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power quality disturbance","power signal","discrete wavelet transform","electric utilities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","power quality","detection","classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Detection of power quality disturbances using discrete wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8192080/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429669","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of power quality disturbances using discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Boumerdes, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Dekhandjipaper558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051448S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125121","isNumber":"8191962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125121","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8191962","articleId":"8192080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192082,"authors":[{"name":"Wafa Derouaz","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Electronic, University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Wafa","lastName":"Derouaz","id":"37086262648"},{"name":"Thouraya Merazi-Meksen","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Electronic, University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Thouraya","lastName":"Merazi-Meksen","id":"37085473931"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0686-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0685-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0687-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192082","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Compressed sensing","Minimization","Speech processing","Discrete cosine transforms","Image reconstruction","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","cryptography","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","Gaussian processes","iterative methods","minimisation","signal reconstruction","speech coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Speech compressive sensing","CS","\u21131-minimization","compressive observations","random Gaussian matrix","computational complexity","speech signal reconstruction","speech quality reconstruction","compression ratios","iteratively reweighted least squares-\u2113p-minimization","\u21131-minimzation","source information encryption","speech-processing applications","IRLS-\u2113p-minimization algorithms","Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients","DCT coefficients","Perceptual Evaluation Speech Quality measure","PESQ"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Compressed Sensing","speech signal","\u21131-minimization","\u2113p-minimization","iteratively reweighted least squares"]}],"abstract":"The interests in Compressed Sensing (CS) come from its ability to provide sampling as well as compression, enhancement, along with encryption of the source information simultaneously.

Implementing a robust Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) system for a high speed milling CNC cutter remains a challenge for various industries to reach improved quality, reduced downtime, increased system safety and lower production costs. The purpose of the present paper is health assessment and RUL estimation of the cutting tool machines. To do so, an approach based the use of Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for tool wear condition monitoring is proposed. Among the main steps is feature extraction where the relevant features of raw data are computed in the form of nodes energy using WPT. The extracted features are then fed to the learning algorithm ELM; the main idea is that ELM involves nonlinear regression in a high dimensional feature space for mapping the input data via a nonlinear function to build a prognostics model. The method was applied to real world data gathered during several cuts of a milling CNC tool. Results showed the significance performances achieved by the WPT and ELM for tool wear condition monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192142","publicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125121/8191962/08192142.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8191962","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven prognostic approach based on wavelet transform and extreme learning machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven prognostic approach based on wavelet transform and extreme learning machine","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192142/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429727","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192142/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven prognostic approach based on wavelet transform and extreme learning machine","confLoc":"Boumerdes, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Laddadapaper395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042793S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125121","isNumber":"8191962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8191962","articleId":"8192142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192144,"authors":[{"name":"Ladjouzi Samir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bouira, Bouira, Algeria"],"firstName":"Ladjouzi","lastName":"Samir","id":"37086170130"},{"name":"Grouni Said","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Maintenance, University of Boumerdes, Boumerdes, Algeria"],"firstName":"Grouni","lastName":"Said","id":"37086169571"},{"name":"Kacimi Nora","affiliation":["Process Control Laboratory, National Polytechnic School, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Kacimi","lastName":"Nora","id":"37086305252"},{"name":"Soufi Youcef","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of T\u00e9bessa, T\u00e9bessa, Algeria"],"firstName":"Soufi","lastName":"Youcef","id":"37085952731"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0686-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0685-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0687-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192144","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Neurons","Nonlinear systems","Computer architecture","Mathematical model","Training","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural net architecture","neural nets","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear system identification","PSNN","Activation Function Extended Pi-Sigma","AFEPS","Delayed Pi-Sigma","Improved Pi-Sigma Neural Network architecture","training algorithm","DPS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pi-Sigma Neural Network","Extended Activation Function Pi-Sigma","Delayed Pi-Sigma","temporal adjustable units","nonlinear systems identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192144","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a modified architecture of a Pi-Sigma Neural Network (PSNN) based on two modifications: extension of the activation function and adding delays to neurons in the hidden layer.

Indeed, these resources are becoming increasingly scarce or even nonexistent. This scarcity has led to the concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) communication which has used to scarce and limits natural resources efficiently without any interference to the primary users (PUs). Among most challenging problems in cognitive radio systems is spectrum sensing concepts. Many strategies exist in the literature for satisfactory detection performance. Energy detection (ED) is popularly preferred approach due to its implementation simplicity and low complexity. But, ED model based on imperfect knowledge of noise power which is difficult to obtain under low SNR environment. Furthermore, sensitivity to noise power fluctuations. In this context, this work proposes and evaluates an improved version of the energy detection algorithm calls Mean ED (MEED) that is able to outperform the classical energy detection scheme. This new technique is inspired of oversampling and bootstrap methods. The performance improvement is evaluated analytically and corroborated with the simulation results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8191962","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125121/8191962/08192177.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple improved mean energy detection in spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192177/","displayDocTitle":"Simple improved mean energy detection in spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429636","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple improved mean energy detection in spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Boumerdes, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Nasrallahpaper161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04357S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125121","isNumber":"8191962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8191962","articleId":"8192177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192181,"authors":[{"name":"Ouamri Mohamed Amine","affiliation":["Universite de Bejaia, Bejaia, Bejaia, DZ"],"firstName":"Ouamri Mohamed","lastName":"Amine"},{"name":"Zenadji Sylia","affiliation":["Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie \u00e9lectrique, Universit\u00e9 de Bejaia, Bejaia, Algeria"],"firstName":"Zenadji","lastName":"Sylia","id":"37086308069"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0686-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0685-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0687-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192181","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Interference","Handover","Mathematical model","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","genetic algorithms","indoor environment","indoor radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-to-noise ratio","enterprise buildings","random placement","femtocell placement","indoor building","NSGA II","traffic load","cellular network","indoor environment","poor indoor coverage problem","femtocells placement","power transmission","femtocells positions","distributed antenna systems","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell Placement","coverage","interference","NSGAII"]}],"abstract":"In order to reduce the traffic load in cellular network and improve the data rates for users located in an indoor environment the Femtocells are used to solve the poor indoor coverage problem. It represents a cost-effective solution compared to other solutions such as Picocells and distributed antenna systems. However, if the signal-to-noise ratio is high then UEs can receive good throughput. For this reason, the manner in which Femtocells are deployed is very important and crucial. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to optimize the positions of Femtocells in enterprise buildings taking into account the power transmission for each Femto. GA (Genetic Algorithm) is used to address the problem of Femtocells placement by minimizing the number of Femto and maximizing indoor coverage. The optimization proposed in our case achieved an improvement of 13.6% for Femtocells positions with maximum coverage compared to the random placement.","doi":"10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192181","publicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125121/8191962/08192181.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8191962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell placement in an indoor building using NSGA II","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192181/","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell placement in an indoor building using NSGA II","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429700","htmlLink":"/document/8192181/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell placement in an indoor building using NSGA II","confLoc":"Boumerdes, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Ouamripaper83.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083512S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125121","isNumber":"8191962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125121","xplore-issue":"8191962","articleId":"8192181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192188,"authors":[{"name":"Masmoudi Ramadhan","affiliation":["D\u00e9p de T\u00e9l\u00e9com.

While chipmakers provide hardware support for basic security and privacy primitives such as enclaves and memory encryption. these primitives do not address hiding of the memory access pattern, information about which may enable attacks on the system or reveal characteristics of sensitive user data. State-of-the-art approaches to protecting the access pattern are largely based on Oblivious RAM (ORAM). Unfortunately, current ORAM implementations suffer from very significant practicality and overhead concerns, including roughly an order of magnitude slowdown, more than 100% memory capacity overheads, and the potential for system deadlock. Memory technology trends are moving towards 3D and 2.5D integration, enabling significant logic capabilities and sophisticated memory interfaces. Leveraging the trends, we propose a new approach to access pattern obfuscation, called ObfusMem. ObfusMem adds the memory to the trusted computing base and incorporates cryptographic engines within the memory. ObfusMem encrypts commands and addresses on the memory bus, hence the access pattern is cryptographically obfuscated from external observers. Our evaluation shows that ObfusMem incurs an overhead of 10.9% on average, which is about an order of magnitude faster than ORAM implementations. Furthermore, ObfusMem does not incur capacity overheads and does not amplify writes. We analyze and compare the security protections provided by ObfusMem and ORAM, and highlight their differences.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192464.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ObfusMem: A low-overhead access obfuscation for trusted memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Cryptography","Random access memory","Hardware","Nonvolatile memory","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data protection","storage management","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trusted computing base","security protections","low-overhead access obfuscation","trusted memories","trustworthy software","memory encryption","ObfusMem","ORAM implementations","memory access pattern protection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access Pattern Ofuscation","Hardware Security","ORAM","Emerging Memory Technologies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"ObfusMem: A low-overhead access obfuscation for trusted memories","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8192464/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430296","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ObfusMem: A low-overhead access obfuscation for trusted memories","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P107Amro.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101653S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192473,"authors":[{"name":"Ruohuang Zheng","affiliation":["University of Rochester"],"firstName":"Ruohuang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086287022"},{"name":"Michael C.

These errors are an important threat to computer system reliability as VLSI technologies continue to scale. Managing memory hardware errors is a critical component in developing an overall system dependability strategy. Memory error detection and correction are supported in a range of available hardware mechanisms. However, memory protections (particularly the more advanced ones) come at substantial costs in performance and energy usage. Moreover, the protection mechanisms are often a fixed, system-wide choice and can not easily adapt to different protection demand of different applications or memory regions. In this paper, we present a new RAIM (redundant array of independent memory) design that compared to the state-of-the-art implementation can easily provide high protection capability and the ability to selectively protect a subset of the memory. A straightforward implementation of the design can incur a substantial memory traffic overhead. We propose a few practical optimizations to mitigate this overhead. With these optimizations the proposed RAIM design offers significant advantages over existing RAIM design at lower or comparable costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430283","htmlLink":"/document/8192473/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Redundant memory array architecture for efficient selective protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundant memory array architecture for efficient selective protection","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P214Ruohuang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151231S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8192474,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Hicks","affiliation":["Virginia Tech"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Hicks","id":"37086276562"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192474","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clank: Architectural support for intermittent computation","abstract":"The processors that drive embedded systems are getting smaller; meanwhile, the batteries used to provide power to those systems have stagnated. If we are to realize the dream of ubiquitous computing promised by the Internet of Things, processors must shed large, heavy, expensive, and high maintenance batteries and, instead, harvest energy from their environment. One challenge with this transition is that harvested energy is insufficient for continuous operation. Unfortunately, existing programs fail miserably when executed intermittently. This paper presents Clank: lightweight architectural support for correct and efficient execution of long-running applications on harvested energy-without programmer intervention or extreme hardware modifications. Clank is a set of hardware buffers and memory-access monitors that dynamically maintain idempotency. Essentially, Clank dynamically decomposes program execution into a stream of restartable sub-executions connected via lightweight checkpoints. To validate Clank's ability to correctly stretch program execution across frequent, random power cycles, and to explore the associated hardware and software overheads, we implement Clank in Verilog, formally verify it, and then add it to an ARM Cortex M0+ processor which we use to run a set of 23 embedded systems benchmarks. Experiments show run-time overheads as low as 2.5%, with run-time overheads of 6% for a version of Clank that adds 1.7% hardware. Clank minimizes checkpoints so much that re-execution time becomes the dominate contributor to run-time overhead.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192474.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"240","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080238","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080238","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192474","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Program processors","Nonvolatile memory","Batteries","Energy harvesting","Checkpointing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["checkpointing","embedded systems","logic design","logic testing","microprocessor chips","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems benchmarks","embedded systems","hardware buffers","ubiquitous computing","processors","ARM Cortex M0+ processor","Clank's ability","memory-access monitors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Harvesting","Intermittent Computation","Batteryless Devices","Idempotence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192474/","displayDocTitle":"Clank: Architectural support for intermittent computation","accessionNumber":"17430289","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192474/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clank: Architectural support for intermittent computation","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P228Matthew.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08556S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192476,"authors":[{"name":"Minesh Patel","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University","ETH Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Minesh","lastName":"Patel","id":"37086188901"},{"name":"Jeremie S.

Volatile DRAM cells can retain information across a wide distribution of times ranging from milliseconds to many minutes, but each cell is currently refreshed every 64ms to account for the extreme tail end of the retention time distribution, leading to a high refresh overhead. Due to poor DRAM technology scaling, this problem is expected to get worse in future device generations. Hence, the current approach of refreshing all cells with the worst-case refresh rate must be replaced with a more intelligent design. Many prior works propose reducing the refresh overhead by extending the default refresh interval to a higher value, which we refer to as the target refresh interval, across parts or all of a DRAM chip. These proposals handle the small set of failing cells that cannot retain data throughout the entire extended refresh interval via retention failure mitigation mechanisms (e.g., error correcting codes or bit-repair mechanisms). This set of failing cells is discovered via retention failure profiling, which is currently a brute-force process that writes a set of known data to DRAM, disables refresh and waits for the duration of the target refresh interval, and then checks for retention failures across the DRAM chip. We show that this brute-force approach is too slow and is detrimental to system execution, especially with frequent online profiling. This paper presents reach profiling, a new methodology for retention failure profiling based on the key observation that an overwhelming majority of failing DRAM cells at a target refresh interval fail more reliably at both longer refresh intervals and higher temperatures. Using 368 state-of-the-art LPDDR4 DRAM chips from three major vendors, we conduct a thorough experimental characterization of the complex set of tradeoffs inherent in the profiling process. We identify three key metrics to guide design choices for retention failure profiling and mitigation mechanisms: coverage, false positive rate, and runtime. We propose reach profiling, a new retention failure profiling mechanism whose key idea is to profile failing cells at a longer refresh interval and/or higher temperature relative to the target conditions in order to maximize failure coverage while minimizing the false positive rate and profiling runtime. We thoroughly explore the tradeoffs associated with reach profiling and show that there is significant room for improvement in DRAM retention failure profiling beyond the brute-force approach. We show with experimental data that on average, by profiling at 250ms above the target refresh interval, our first implementation of reach profiling (called REAPER) can attain greater than 99% coverage of failing DRAM cells with less than a 50% false positive rate while running 2.5x faster than the brute-force approach. In addition, our end-to-end evaluations show that REAPER enables significant system performance improvement and DRAM power reduction, outperforming the brute-force approach and enabling high-performance operation at longer refresh intervals that were previously unreasonable to employ due to the high associated profiling overhead.","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080242","startPage":"255","endPage":"268","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium

improvements in GPU-based high performance computing have been tightly coupled to transistor scaling. As Moore's law slows down, and the number of transistors per die no longer grows at historical rates, the performance curve of single monolithic GPUs will ultimately plateau. However, the need for higher performing GPUs continues to exist in many domains. To address this need, in this paper we demonstrate that package-level integration of multiple GPU modules to build larger logical GPUs can enable continuous performance scaling beyond Moore's law. Specifically, we propose partitioning GPUs into easily manufacturable basic GPU Modules (GPMs), and integrating them on package using high bandwidth and power efficient signaling technologies. We lay out the details and evaluate the feasibility of a basic Multi-Chip-Module GPU (MCM-GPU) design. We then propose three architectural optimizations that significantly improve GPM data locality and minimize the sensitivity on inter-GPM bandwidth. Our evaluation shows that the optimized MCM-GPU achieves 22.8% speedup and 5x inter-GPM bandwidth reduction when compared to the basic MCM-GPU architecture. Most importantly, the optimized MCM-GPU design is 45.5% faster than the largest implementable monolithic GPU, and performs within 10% of a hypothetical (and unbuildable) monolithic GPU. Lastly we show that our optimized MCM-GPU is 26.8% faster than an equally equipped Multi-GPU system with the same total number of SMs and DRAM bandwidth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430280","htmlLink":"/document/8192482/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"MCM-GPU: Multi-chip-module GPUs for continued performance scalability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MCM-GPU: Multi-chip-module GPUs for continued performance scalability","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P320Akhil.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088999S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192483,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Nazari","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Nazari","id":"37844184100"},{"name":"Nader Sehatbakhsh","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Sehatbakhsh","id":"37061816600"},{"name":"Monjur Alam","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Monjur","lastName":"Alam","id":"37086282981"},{"name":"Alenka Zajic","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"],"firstName":"Alenka","lastName":"Zajic"},{"name":"Milos Prvulovic","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Prvulovic","id":"37298065900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192483","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":516},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192483","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Training","Anomaly detection","Detectors","Frequency modulation","Malware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invasive software","software fault tolerance","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EDDIE","system monitoring","execution monitoring","software monitoring","EM-Based Detection of Deviations in Program Execution","anomaly detection","malware characterization","embedded device security monitoring","IoT device security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware Security","EM Emanation","Malware Detection","Internet-of-Things"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080223","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192483.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EDDIE: EM-based detection of deviations in program execution","abstract":"This paper describes EM-Based Detection of Deviations in Program Execution (EDDIE), a new method for detecting anomalies in program execution, such as malware and other code injections, without introducing any overheads, adding any hardware support, changing any software, or using any resources on the monitored system itself. Monitoring with EDDIE involves receiving electromagnetic (EM) emanations that are emitted as a side effect of execution on the monitored system, and it relies on spikes in the EM spectrum that are produced as a result of periodic (e.g. loop) activity in the monitored execution. During training, EDDIE characterizes normal execution behavior in terms of peaks in the EM spectrum that are observed at various points in the program execution, but it does not need any characterization of the malware or other code that might later be injected. During monitoring, EDDIE identifies peaks in the observed EM spectrum, and compares these peaks to those learned during training. Since EDDIE requires no resources on the monitored machine and no changes to the monitored software, it is especially well suited for security monitoring of embedded and IoT devices. We evaluate EDDIE on a real IoT system and in a cycle-accurate simulator, and find that even relatively brief injected bursts of activity (a few milliseconds) are detected by EDDIE with high accuracy, and that it also accurately detects when even a few instructions are injected into an existing loop within the application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192483/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17430307","publicationDate":"June 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192483/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"EDDIE: EM-based detection of deviations in program execution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EDDIE: EM-based detection of deviations in program execution","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P333Alireza.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135511S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8192487,"authors":[{"name":"Raghu Prabhakar","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Raghu","lastName":"Prabhakar","id":"38234980400"},{"name":"Yaqi Zhang","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Yaqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085852303"},{"name":"David Koeplinger","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Koeplinger","id":"38469311900"},{"name":"Matt Feldman","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Feldman","id":"37086300958"},{"name":"Tian Zhao","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086299388"},{"name":"Stefan Hadjis","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Hadjis","id":"37085360534"},{"name":"Ardavan Pedram","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Ardavan","lastName":"Pedram","id":"37299270000"},{"name":"Christos Kozyrakis","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Kozyrakis","id":"37282352700"},{"name":"Kunle Olukotun","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Kunle","lastName":"Olukotun","id":"37282353900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192487","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1838},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Programming","Indexes","System-on-chip","Fabrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","parallel programming","pipeline processing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pattern Memory Units","Plasticine","parallel patterns","energy-efficient accelerators","spatially reconfigurable architecture","parallel programming","data locality","Pattern Compute Units","reconfigurable SIMD functional units","multi-stage pipelines","banked scratchpad memories","configurable address decoders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel patterns","reconfigurable architectures","hardware accelerators","CGRAs"]}],"abstract":"Reconfigurable architectures have gained popularity in recent years as they allow the design of energy-efficient accelerators. Fine-grain fabrics (e.g. FPGAs) have traditionally suffered from performance and power inefficiencies due to bit-level reconfigurable abstractions. Both fine-grain and coarse-grain architectures (e.g. CGRAs) traditionally require low level programming and suffer from long compilation times. We address both challenges with Plasticine, a new spatially reconfigurable architecture designed to efficiently execute applications composed of parallel patterns. Parallel patterns have emerged from recent research on parallel programming as powerful, high-level abstractions that can elegantly capture data locality, memory access patterns, and parallelism across a wide range of dense and sparse applications. We motivate Plasticine by first observing key application characteristics captured by parallel patterns that are amenable to hardware acceleration, such as hierarchical parallelism, data locality, memory access patterns, and control flow. Based on these observations, we architect Plasticine as a collection of Pattern Compute Units and Pattern Memory Units. Pattern Compute Units are multi-stage pipelines of reconfigurable SIMD functional units that can efficiently execute nested patterns. Data locality is exploited in Pattern Memory Units using banked scratchpad memories and configurable address decoders. Multiple on-chip address generators and scatter-gather engines make efficient use of DRAM bandwidth by supporting a large number of outstanding memory requests, memory coalescing, and burst mode for dense accesses. Plasticine has an area footprint of 113 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n in a 28 nm process, and consumes a maximum power of 49 W at a 1 GHz clock.

For example, the OS may migrate data between physical pages to manage heterogeneous memory devices. We refer to such activities as page remappings. Unfortunately, page remappings are expensive. We show that a big part of this cost arises from address translation coherence, particularly on systems employing virtualization. In response, we propose hardware translation invalidation and coherence or HATRIC, a readily implementable hardware mechanism to piggyback translation coherence atop existing cache coherence protocols. We perform detailed studies using KVM-based virtualization, showing that HATRIC achieves up to 30% performance and 10% energy benefits, for per-CPU area overheads of 0.2%. We also quantify HATRIC's benefits on systems running Xen and find up to 33% performance improvements.","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080211","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192491.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware translation coherence for virtualized systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hardware translation coherence for virtualized systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192491/","publicationDate":"June 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430308","htmlLink":"/document/8192491/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware translation coherence for virtualized systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P430Zi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126705S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8192494,"authors":[{"name":"Jee Ho Ryoo","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Jee Ho","lastName":"Ryoo","id":"37085473274"},{"name":"Nagendra Gulur","affiliation":["Texas Instruments"],"firstName":"Nagendra","lastName":"Gulur","id":"38233084500"},{"name":"Shuang Song","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Song","id":"37085691333"},{"name":"Lizy K.

In the radix-4 type of page tables used in x86 architectures, a TLB-miss necessitates up to 24 memory references for one guest to host translation. While dedicated page walk caches and such recent enhancements eliminate many of these memory references, our measurements on the Intel Skylake processors indicate that many programs in virtualized mode of execution still spend hundreds of cycles for translations that do not hit in the TLBs. This paper presents an innovative scheme to reduce the cost of address translations by using a very large Translation Lookaside Buffer that is part of memory, the POM-TLB. In the POM-TLB, only one access is required instead of up to 24 accesses required in commonly used 2D walks with radix-4 type of page tables. Even if many of the 24 accesses may hit in the page walk caches, the aggregated cost of the many hits plus the overhead of occasional misses from page walk caches still exceeds the cost of one access to the POM-TLB. Since the POM-TLB is part of the memory space, TLB entries (as opposed to multiple page table entries) can be cached in large L2 and L3 data caches, yielding significant benefits. Through detailed evaluation running SPEC, PARSEC and graph workloads, we demonstrate that the proposed POM-TLB improves performance by approximately 10% on average. The improvement is more than 16% for 5 of the benchmarks. It is further seen that a POM-TLB of 16MB size can eliminate nearly all TLB misses in 8-core systems.","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080210","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192494.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rethinking TLB designs in virtualized environments: A very large part-of-memory TLB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Rethinking TLB designs in virtualized environments: A very large part-of-memory TLB","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192494/","publicationDate":"June 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430292","htmlLink":"/document/8192494/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rethinking TLB designs in virtualized environments: A very large part-of-memory TLB","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P469Jee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095397S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8192495,"authors":[{"name":"Aasheesh Kolli","affiliation":["ARM, University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Aasheesh","lastName":"Kolli","id":"37085993674"},{"name":"Vaibhav Gogte","affiliation":["ARM, University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Gogte","id":"37086041289"},{"name":"Ali Saidi","affiliation":["ARM, University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Saidi","id":"37281702100"},{"name":"Stephan Diestelhorst","affiliation":["ARM, University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Diestelhorst","id":"37540973100"},{"name":"Peter M.

Ongoing research has sought mechanisms to allow programmers to implement recoverable data structures in these new main memories. Ensuring recoverability requires programmer control of the order of persistent stores; recent work proposes persistency models as an extension to memory consistency to specify such ordering. Prior work has considered persistency models at the abstraction of the instruction set architecture. Instead, we argue for extending the language-level memory model to provide guarantees on the order of persistent writes. We explore a taxonomy of guarantees a language-level persistency model might provide, considering both atomicity and ordering constraints on groups of persistent stores. Then, we propose and evaluate Acquire-Release Persistency (ARP), a language-level persistency model for C++11. We describe how to compile code written for ARP to a state-of-the-art ISA-level persistency model. We then consider enhancements to the ISA-level persistency model that can distinguish memory consistency constraints required for proper synchronization but unnecessary for correct recovery. With these optimizations, we show that ARP increases performance by up to 33.2% (19.8% avg.) over coding directly to the baseline ISA-level persistency model for a suite of persistent-write-intensive workloads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192495.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"493","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Language-level persistency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data structures","Software","Hardware","Semantics","Optimization","Taxonomy","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","data structures","instruction sets","memory architecture","multiprocessing systems","program compilers","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["byte-addressable persistent memories","Intel/Micron 3D XPoint memory","recoverable data structures","persistency models","language-level memory model","language-level persistency model","persistent stores","state-of-the-art ISA-level","memory consistency constraints","baseline ISA-level persistency model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Persistent memories","memory persistency","language-level models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Language-level persistency","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8192495/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430259","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Language-level persistency","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P481Aasheesh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.166883S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8192499,"authors":[{"name":"Yongming Shen","affiliation":["Stony Brook University"],"firstName":"Yongming","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085772767"},{"name":"Michael Ferdman","affiliation":["Stony Brook University"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ferdman","id":"37395316000"},{"name":"Peter Milder","affiliation":["Stony Brook University"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Milder","id":"37403753800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192499","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2541},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Convolutional codes","Throughput","Design methodology","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","learning (artificial intelligence)","logic design","logic gates","neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource partitioning","convolutional neural networks","machine learning","processor structure","Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA","CNN accelerator efficiency maximization","automated design methodology","FPGA resources","AlexNet CNN","single large processor","multiple smaller specialized processors","FPGA-based accelerators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Network","FPGA","Accelerator"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080221","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192499.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing CNN accelerator efficiency through resource partitioning","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are revolutionizing machine learning, but they present significant computational challenges. Recently, many FPGA-based accelerators have been proposed to improve the performance and efficiency of CNNs. Current approaches construct a single processor that computes the CNN layers one at a time; the processor is optimized to maximize the throughput at which the collection of layers is computed. However, this approach leads to inefficient designs because the same processor structure is used to compute CNN layers of radically varying dimensions. We present a new CNN accelerator paradigm and an accompanying automated design methodology that partitions the available FPGA resources into multiple processors, each of which is tailored for a different subset of the CNN convolutional layers. Using the same FPGA resources as a single large processor, multiple smaller specialized processors increase computational efficiency and lead to a higher overall throughput. Our design methodology achieves 3.8x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art approach on evaluating the popular AlexNet CNN on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. For the more recent SqueezeNet and GoogLeNet, the speedups are 2.2x and 2.0x.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430268","htmlLink":"/document/8192499/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing CNN accelerator efficiency through resource partitioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing CNN accelerator efficiency through resource partitioning","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P535Yongming.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125995S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8192500,"authors":[{"name":"Jiecao Yu","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Jiecao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086264968"},{"name":"Andrew Lukefahr","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lukefahr","id":"38580762400"},{"name":"David Palframan","affiliation":["ARM"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Palframan","id":"37086270596"},{"name":"Ganesh Dasika","affiliation":["ARM"],"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Dasika","id":"37428258500"},{"name":"Reetuparna Das","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Reetuparna","lastName":"Das","id":"37534767200"},{"name":"Scott Mahlke","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Mahlke","id":"37265029800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192500","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1061},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Hardware","Computational modeling","Parallel processing","Graphics processing units","Matrix converters","Microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["node pruning","SIMD-aware weight pruning","Scalpel","traditional weight pruning","DNN pruning","Deep Neural Networks","network sparsity","pruned networks","data-parallel hardware organization","low-parallelism hardware","high-parallelism hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network pruning","hardware parallelism","single instruction","multiple data"]}],"abstract":"As the size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) continues to grow to increase accuracy and solve more complex problems, their energy footprint also scales. Weight pruning reduces DNN model size and the computation by removing redundant weights. However, we implemented weight pruning for several popular networks on a variety of hardware platforms and observed surprising results. For many networks, the network sparsity caused by weight pruning will actually hurt the overall performance despite large reductions in the model size and required multiply-accumulate operations. Also, encoding the sparse format of pruned networks incurs additional storage space overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose Scalpel that customizes DNN pruning to the underlying hardware by matching the pruned network structure to the data-parallel hardware organization. Scalpel consists of two techniques: SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning. For low-parallelism hardware (e.g., microcontroller), SIMD-aware weight pruning maintains weights in aligned fixed-size groups to fully utilize the SIMD units. For high-parallelism hardware (e.g., GPU), node pruning removes redundant nodes, not redundant weights, thereby reducing computation without sacrificing the dense matrix format. For hardware with moderate parallelism (e.g., desktop CPU), SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning are synergistically applied together. Across the microcontroller, CPU and GPU, Scalpel achieves mean speedups of 3.54x, 2.61x, and 1.25x while reducing the model sizes by 88%, 82%, and 53%. In comparison, traditional weight pruning achieves mean speedups of 1.90x, 1.06x, 0.41x across the three platforms.","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer

communication in low power Internet of Things (IoT) wireless networks. Error coding flexibility for wireless communication allows IoT applications to exploit the large tradeoff space in data rate, link distance and energy-efficiency. As a solution, we present a light-weight Galois Field (GF) processor to enable energy-efficient block coding and symmetric/asymmetric cryptography kernel processing for a wide range of GF sizes (2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n, m = 2, 3, ..., 233) and arbitrary irreducible polynomials. Program directed connections among primitive GF arithmetic units enable dynamically configured parallelism to efficiently perform either four-way SIMD 5- to 8-bit GF operations, including multiplicative inverse, or a wide bit-width (e.g., 32-bit) GF product in a single cycle. To illustrate our ideas, we synthesized our GF processor in a 28nm technology. Compared to a baseline software implementation optimized for a general purpose ARM M0+ processor, our processor exhibits a 5-20 \u00d7 speedup for a range of error correction codes and symmetric/asymmetric cryptography applications. Additionally, our proposed GF processor consumes 431\u03bcW at 0.9V and 100MHz, and achieves 35.5pJ/b energy efficiency while executing AES operations at 12.2Mbps.

Since this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, it is important to study techniques that can make it run fast on parallel hardware. In this paper, we provide the first analysis of a technique called BUCKWILD! that uses both asynchronous execution and low-precision computation. We introduce the DMGC model, the first conceptualization of the parameter space that exists when implementing low-precision SGD, and show that it provides a way to both classify these algorithms and model their performance. We leverage this insight to propose and analyze techniques to improve the speed of low-precision SGD.

To unleash the power of FPGA, however, the programmability gap has to be filled so that applications specified in high-level programming languages can be efficiently mapped and scheduled on FPGA. The above problem is even more challenging for irregular applications, in which the execution dependency can only be determined at run time. Thus over-serialized accelerators are generated from existing works that rely on compile time analysis to schedule the computation. In this work, we propose a comprehensive software-hardware co-design framework, which captures parallelism in irregular applications and aggressively schedules pipelined execution on reconfigurable platform. Based on an inherently parallel abstraction packaging parallelism for runtime schedule, our framework significantly differs from existing works that tend to schedule executions at compile time. An irregular application is formulated as a set of tasks with their dependencies specified as rules describing the conditions under which a subset of tasks can be executed concurrently. Then datapaths on FPGA will be generated by transforming applications in the formulation into task pipelines orchestrated by evaluating rules at runtime, which could exploit fine-grained pipeline parallelism as handcrafted accelerators do. An evaluation shows that this framework is able to produce datapath with its quality close to handcrafted designs. Experiments show that generated accelerators are dramatically more efficient than those created by current high-level synthesis tools. Meanwhile, accelerators generated for a set of irregular applications attain 0.5\u00d7 ~1.9\u00d7 performance compared to equivalent software implementations we selected on a server-grade 10-core processor, with the memory subsystem remaining as the bottleneck.","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080228","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192503.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggressive pipelining of irregular applications on reconfigurable hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Aggressive pipelining of irregular applications on reconfigurable hardware","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430262","htmlLink":"/document/8192503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggressive pipelining of irregular applications on reconfigurable hardware","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P575Zhaoshi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122927S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8192506,"authors":[{"name":"Rajat Kateja","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Rajat","lastName":"Kateja","id":"37086288745"},{"name":"Anirudh Badam","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Anirudh","lastName":"Badam","id":"37073240300"},{"name":"Sriram Govindan","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Govindan","id":"37404041200"},{"name":"Bikash Sharma","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Bikash","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37581298900"},{"name":"Greg Ganger","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Ganger","id":"37275583000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192506","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192506","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory","Servers","Hardware","Cooling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Viyojit","DRAM capacities","battery-backed DRAM","NonVolatile Memories","data-intensive applications","battery backup","battery sizes","provision substantially smaller batteries","provisioned battery capacity","battery capacities","decoupling battery","DRAM capacity","NVM technologies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NVM","Battery-backed DRAM"]}],"abstract":"Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) can significantly improve the performance of data-intensive applications. A popular form of NVM is Battery-backed DRAM, which is available and in use today with DRAMs latency and without the endurance problems of emerging NVM technologies. Modern servers can be provisioned with up-to 4 TB of DRAM, and provisioning battery backup to write out such large memories is hard because of the large battery sizes and the added hardware and cooling costs. We present Viyojit, a system that exploits the skew in write working sets of applications to provision substantially smaller batteries while still ensuring durability for the entire DRAM capacity. Viyojit achieves this by bounding the number of dirty pages in DRAM based on the provisioned battery capacity and proactively writing out infrequently written pages to an SSD. Even for write-heavy workloads with less skew than we observe in analysis of real data center traces, Viyojit reduces the required battery capacity to 11% of the original size, with a performance overhead of 7-25%. Thus, Viyojit frees battery-backed DRAM from stunted growth of battery capacities and enables servers with terabytes of battery-backed DRAM.","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080236","startPage":"613","endPage":"626","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192506.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Viyojit: Decoupling battery and DRAM capacities for battery-backed DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192506/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Viyojit: Decoupling battery and DRAM capacities for battery-backed DRAM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430270","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192506/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Viyojit: Decoupling battery and DRAM capacities for battery-backed DRAM","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P613Rajat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117462S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":8192507,"authors":[{"name":"Vinson Young","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Vinson","lastName":"Young","id":"37086293156"},{"name":"Prashant J.

As the capacity of DRAM cache is typically large, prior techniques on cache compression, which solely focus on improving cache capacity, provide only a marginal benefit. We show that more performance benefit can be obtained if the compression of the DRAM cache is tailored to provide higher bandwidth. If a DRAM cache can provide two compressed lines in a single access, and both lines are useful, the effective bandwidth of the DRAM cache would double. Unfortunately, it is not straight-forward to compress DRAM caches for bandwidth. The typically used Traditional Set Indexing (TSI) maps consecutive lines to consecutive sets, so the multiple compressed lines obtained from the set are from spatially distant locations and unlikely to be used within a short period of each other. We can change the indexing of the cache to place consecutive lines in the same set to improve bandwidth; however, when the data is incompressible, such spatial indexing reduces effective capacity and causes significant slowdown. Ideally, we would like to have spatial indexing when the data is compressible and TSI otherwise. To this end, we propose Dynamic-Indexing Cache comprEssion (DICE), a dynamic design that can adapt between spatial indexing and TSI, depending on the compressibility of the data. We also propose low-cost Cache Index Predictors (CIP) that can accurately predict the cache indexing scheme on access in order to avoid probing both indices for retrieving a given cache line. Our studies with a 1GB DRAM cache, on a wide range of workloads (including SPEC and Graph), show that DICE improves performance by 19.0% and reduces energy-delay-product by 36% on average. DICE is within 3% of a design that has double the capacity and double the bandwidth. DICE incurs a storage overhead of less than 1KB and does not rely on any OS support.","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080243","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192507.pdf","startPage":"627","endPage":"638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"DICE: Compressing DRAM caches for bandwidth and capacity","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430274","htmlLink":"/document/8192507/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DICE: Compressing DRAM caches for bandwidth and capacity","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P627Vinson.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119156S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192508,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Drumond","affiliation":["EcoCloud, EPFL"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Drumond","id":"37085769590"},{"name":"Alexandros Daglis","affiliation":["EcoCloud, EPFL"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Daglis","id":"37085728823"},{"name":"Nooshin Mirzadeh","affiliation":["EcoCloud, EPFL"],"firstName":"Nooshin","lastName":"Mirzadeh","id":"37085877798"},{"name":"Dmitrii Ustiugov","affiliation":["EcoCloud, EPFL"],"firstName":"Dmitrii","lastName":"Ustiugov","id":"37086155045"},{"name":"Javier Picorel","affiliation":["EcoCloud, EPFL"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Picorel","id":"38263206700"},{"name":"Babak Falsafi","affiliation":["EcoCloud, EPFL"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Falsafi","id":"37364501300"},{"name":"Boris Grot","affiliation":["EcoCloud, University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Grot","id":"37669789100"},{"name":"Dionisios Pnevmatikatos","affiliation":["FORTH-ICS & ECE-TUC"],"firstName":"Dionisios","lastName":"Pnevmatikatos","id":"37265760300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192508","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192508","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data analysis","Bandwidth","Hardware","Engines","Memory management","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","data analysis","data reduction","DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algorithm-hardware co-design","sequential accesses","accesses memory","baseline NMP system","system designers","traditional CPU-centric architectures stagnates","architectural approaches","near-memory processing architectures","computing efficiency","memory-resident data","modern data analytics operators","random memory accesses","wasteful DRAM row buffer activations","fine-grained random accesses","data movement reduction","memory access energy","NMP ample bandwidth","Mondrian Data Engine","co-designed NMP architecture","data analytics","Dennard scaling","caches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Near-memory processing","sequential memory access","algorithm-hardware co-design"]}],"abstract":"The increasing demand for extracting value out of ever-growing data poses an ongoing challenge to system designers, a task only made trickier by the end of Dennard scaling. As the performance density of traditional CPU-centric architectures stagnates, advancing compute capabilities necessitates novel architectural approaches. Near-memory processing (NMP) architectures are reemerging as promising candidates to improve computing efficiency through tight coupling of logic and memory. NMP architectures are especially fitting for data analytics, as they provide immense bandwidth to memory-resident data and dramatically reduce data movement, the main source of energy consumption. Modern data analytics operators are optimized for CPU execution and hence rely on large caches and employ random memory accesses. In the context of NMP, such random accesses result in wasteful DRAM row buffer activations that account for a significant fraction of the total memory access energy. In addition, utilizing NMP's ample bandwidth with fine-grained random accesses requires complex hardware that cannot be accommodated under NMP's tight area and power constraints. Our thesis is that efficient NMP calls for an algorithm-hardware co-design that favors algorithms with sequential accesses to enable simple hardware that accesses memory in streams. We introduce an instance of such a co-designed NMP architecture for data analytics, the Mondrian Data Engine. Compared to a CPU-centric and a baseline NMP system, the Mondrian Data Engine improves the performance of basic data analytics operators by up to 49\u00d7 and 5\u00d7, and efficiency by up to 28\u00d7 and 5\u00d7, respectively.","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192508.pdf","startPage":"639","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080233","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The mondrian data engine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The mondrian data engine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192508/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192508/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430304","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The mondrian data engine","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P639Mario.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123243S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8192510,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Boyapati","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Boyapati","id":"38253403300"},{"name":"Jiayi Huang","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086043929"},{"name":"Pritam Majumder","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Pritam","lastName":"Majumder","id":"37085418087"},{"name":"Ki Hwan Yum","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Ki Hwan","lastName":"Yum","id":"38186137500"},{"name":"Eun Jung Kim","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Eun Jung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38188695900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192510","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":767},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192510","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nickel","Memory management","Multicore processing","Data compression","Hardware","Throughput","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","data analysis","data compression","graph theory","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","parallel processing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip components","hardware data approximation framework","online data error control mechanism","high performance NoCs","approximate matching","data patterns","data movement","low application error","data intensive graph processing application","Network-on-Chip architectures","unsustainable power consumption","memory bandwidth demands","massively parallel multicore systems","processor-in-memory","Approximate Computing","high performance computation","data intensive applications","image/video processing","big data analytics","NoC data compression","APPROX-NoC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networks-On-Chip","Approximate Computing","Data Compression"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080241","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192510.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"APPROX-NoC: A data approximation framework for Network-on-Chip architectures","abstract":"The trend of unsustainable power consumption and large memory bandwidth demands in massively parallel multicore systems, with the advent of the big data era, has brought upon the onset of alternate computation paradigms utilizing heterogeneity, specialization, processor-in-memory and approximation. Approximate Computing is being touted as a viable solution for high performance computation by relaxing the accuracy constraints of applications. This trend has been accentuated by emerging data intensive applications in domains like image/video processing, machine learning and big data analytics that allow inaccurate outputs within an acceptable variance. Leveraging relaxed accuracy for high throughput in Networks-on-Chip (NoCs), which have rapidly become the accepted method for connecting a large number of on-chip components, has not yet been explored. We propose APPROX-NoC, a hardware data approximation framework with an online data error control mechanism for high performance NoCs. APPROX-NoC facilitates approximate matching of data patterns, within a controllable value range, to compress them thereby reducing the volume of data movement across the chip. Our evaluation shows that APPROX-NoC achieves on average up to 9% latency reduction and 60% throughput improvement compared with state-of-the-art NoC data compression mechanisms, while maintaining low application error. Additionally, with a data intensive graph processing application we achieve a 36.7% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art compression mechanisms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192510/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430305","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"APPROX-NoC: A data approximation framework for Network-on-Chip architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"APPROX-NoC: A data approximation framework for Network-on-Chip architectures","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P666Rahul.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090226S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8192512,"authors":[{"name":"Aosen Wang","affiliation":["State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Aosen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085367063"},{"name":"Lizhong Chen","affiliation":["Oregon State University, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Lizhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086291894"},{"name":"Wenyao Xu","affiliation":["State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wenyao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37597167400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192512","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Wearable computers","Wearable sensors","Discrete wavelet transforms","Engines","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","data analysis","health care","patient monitoring","power aware computing","wearable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Automatic XPro Generator","wearable sensors","cross-end architecture","analytic engine architecture","wearable computers","sophisticated analytic capabilities","computer architects","intelligent analytic capabilities","wellness applications","healthcare","human bodies","wearable computing systems","wearables","data analytics","cross-end processing architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-End Architecture","Low Power","Data Analytics","Wearable Devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192512","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080219","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","abstract":"Wearable computing systems have spurred many opportunities to continuously monitor human bodies with sensors worn on or implanted in the body. These emerging platforms have started to revolutionize many fields, including healthcare and wellness applications, particularly when integrated with intelligent analytic capabilities. However, a significant challenge that computer architects are facing is how to embed sophisticated analytic capabilities in wearable computers in an energy-efficient way while not compromising system performance. In this paper, we present XPro, a novel cross-end analytic engine architecture for wearable computing systems. The proposed cross-end architecture is able to realize a generic classification design across wearable sensors and a data aggregator with high energy-efficiency. To facilitate the practical use of XPro, we also develop an Automatic XPro Generator that formally generates XPro instances according to specific design constraints. As a proof of concept, we study the design and implementation of XPro with six different health applications. Evaluation results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, XPro can increase the battery life of the sensor node by 1.6-2.4X while at the same time reducing system delay by 15.6-60.8% for wearable computing systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","startPage":"69","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192512.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"XPro: A cross-end processing architecture for data analytics in wearables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192512/","displayDocTitle":"XPro: A cross-end processing architecture for data analytics in wearables","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430264","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"XPro: A cross-end processing architecture for data analytics in wearables","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P69Aosen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1143S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192514,"authors":[{"name":"Masoumeh Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Masoumeh","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37398164600"},{"name":"Masoud Daneshtalab","affiliation":["Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden","M\u00e4lardalen University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Daneshtalab","id":"37298922900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192514","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","System recovery","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Switches","Multiprocessor interconnection","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","microprocessor chips","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadlock-free routing algorithms","deterministic routing","deadlock-free interconnection networks","cyclic dependency","acyclic channel dependency graph","routing algorithms","on-chip-off-chip networks","Dally's theory","partitioning methodology","n-dimensional mesh","k-ary n-cube topologies","maximally fully adaptive routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic Dependencies","Deadlock-free Routing Algorithms","Interconnection Networks"]}],"abstract":"Freedom from deadlock is one of the most important issues when designing routing algorithms in on-chip/off-chip networks. Many works have been developed upon Dally's theory proving that a network is deadlock-free if there is no cyclic dependency on the channel dependency graph. However, finding such acyclic graph has been very challenging, which limits Dally's theory to networks with a low number of channels. In this paper, we introduce three theorems that directly lead to routing algorithms with an acyclic channel dependency graph. We also propose the partitioning methodology, enabling a design to reach the maximum adaptiveness for the n-dimensional mesh and k-ary n-cube topologies with any given number of channels. In addition, deadlock-free routing algorithms can be derived ranging from maximally fully adaptive routing down to deterministic routing. The proposed theorems can drastically remove the difficulties of designing deadlock-free routing algorithms.","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080253","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192514.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","startPage":"703","endPage":"715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EbDa: A new theory on design and verification of deadlock-free interconnection networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EbDa: A new theory on design and verification of deadlock-free interconnection networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192514/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430266","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8192514/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EbDa: A new theory on design and verification of deadlock-free interconnection networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P703Masoumeh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090515S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8192515,"authors":[{"name":"Ofir Weisse","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Ofir","lastName":"Weisse","id":"37086122516"},{"name":"Valeria Bertacco","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Bertacco","id":"37267142300"},{"name":"Todd Austin","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Austin","id":"37267010600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8192515","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Hardware","Cloud computing","Servers","Virtual machine monitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","software libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lighttpd","enclave entry-calls","out-calls","baseline SGX","lost cycles","secret data","SGX library primitives","library calls","SGX interface framework","system call","HotCalls","SGX secure enclaves","SGX secure execution technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SGX","Hardware security","Performance optimization"]}],"abstract":"Intel's SGX secure execution technology allows running computations on secret data using untrusted servers. While recent work showed how to port applications and large-scale computations to run under SGX, the performance implications of using the technology remains an open question. We present the first comprehensive quantitative study to evaluate the performance of SGX. We show that straightforward use of SGX library primitives for calling functions add between 8,200-17,000 cycles overhead, compared to 150 cycles of a typical system call. We quantify the performance impact of these library calls and show that in applications with high system calls frequency, such as memcached, openVPN, and lighttpd, which all have high bandwidth network requirements, the performance degradation may be as high as 79%. We investigate the sources of this performance degradation by leveraging a new set of microbenchmarks for SGX-specific operations such as enclave entry-calls and out-calls, and encrypted memory I/O accesses. We leverage the insights we gain from these analyses to design a new SGX interface framework HotCalls. HotCalls are based on a synchronization spin-lock mechanism and provide a 13-27x speedup over the default interface. It can easily be integrated into existing code, making it a practical solution. Compared to a baseline SGX implementation of memcached, openVPN, and lighttpd - we show that using the new interface boosts the throughput by 2.6-3.7x, and reduces application latency by 62-74%.","doi":"10.1145/3079856.3080208","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126322/8192462/08192515.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8192462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080208","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","startPage":"81","endPage":"93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regaining lost cycles with HotCalls: A fast interface for SGX secure enclaves","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8192515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Regaining lost cycles with HotCalls: A fast interface for SGX secure enclaves","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8192515/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8192515/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17430281","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regaining lost cycles with HotCalls: A fast interface for SGX secure enclaves","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"P81Ofir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090143S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126322","isNumber":"8192462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126322","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8192462","articleId":"8192515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8193366,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In view of these properties, we believe needlets may turn out to be especially useful in the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data on the incomplete sky, as well as of other cosmological observations. As a final advantage, we stress that the implementation of needlets is computationally very convenient and may rely completely on standard data analysis packages such as healpix.","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8193355/08193366.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"545","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12550.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12550.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8193355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8193366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spherical needlets for cosmic microwave background data analysis","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["methods: data analysis","cosmic microwave background","cosmology: observations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8193366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Spherical needlets for cosmic microwave background data analysis","volume":"383","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical needlets for cosmic microwave background data analysis","sourcePdf":"mnras03830539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033075S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","isNumber":"8193355","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","citationCount":"14","articleId":"8193366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-08-17"},{"_id":8194537,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The 16-fold increase in observing bandwidth, from 2 \u00d7 128 to 2 \u00d7 2048 MHz, high-bit sampling and the addition of 16 zoom windows (each divided into further 2048 channels) provide major improvements for all ATCA observations. The benefits of the new system are: (1) hugely increased radio continuum and polarization sensitivity as well as image fidelity; (2) substantially improved capability to search for and map emission and absorption lines over large velocity ranges; (3) simultaneous multi-line and continuum observations; (4) increased sensitivity, survey speed and dynamic range due to high-bit sampling and (5) high-velocity resolution, while maintaining full polarization output. The new CABB system encourages all observers to make use of both spectral line and continuum data to achieve their full potential.Given the dramatic increase of the ATCA capabilities in all bands (ranging from 1.1 to 105 GHz) CABB enables scientific projects that were not feasible before the upgrade, such as simultaneous observations of multiple spectral lines, on-the-fly mapping, fast follow-up of radio transients (e.g. the radio afterglow of new supernovae) and maser observation at high-velocity resolution and full polarization.

This is combined with the dramatic expansion in mobile networks, involving millions (or even billions) of subscribers with a greater number of current and future mobile applications (e.g. IoT). Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture has been proposed as a novel concept to gain the benefits of cloud computing as an efficient computing resource, to meet the requirements of future cellular networks. However, the computational complexity of obtaining the channel state information in the full-centralized C-RAN increases as the size of the network is scaled up, as a result of enlargement in channel information matrices. To tackle this problem of complexity and latency, MapReduce framework and fast matrix algorithms are proposed. This paper presents two levels of complexity reduction in the process of estimating the channel information in cellular networks. The results illustrate that complexity can be minimized from O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) to O((N/k)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n), where N is the total number of RRHs and k is the number of RRHs per group, by dividing the processing of RRHs into parallel groups and harnessing the MapReduce parallel algorithm in order to process them. The second approach reduces the computation complexity from O((N/k)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) to O((N/k)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.807</sup>\n) using the algorithms of fast matrix inversion. The reduction in complexity and latency leads to a significant improvement in both the estimation time and in the scalability of C-RAN networks.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08194733.pdf","startPage":"6927","endPage":"6946","publicationTitle":"IEEE

predecessors. However, as there will be hundreds and thousands of wireless cells deployed in the 5G network, transporting the enormous volume of data instigated from high capacity 5G wireless cells to the core network in a cost-effective and greener manner with a low latency still remains one of the major hurdles. Therefore, in this paper, we exploit different optical transport network architectures and technologies that can be used to build an efficient fronthaul network for 5G, in order to carry data between wireless cells and the central office. Particularly, we equitably compare multiple fronthaul architectures in terms of major requirements of 5G fronthaul network such as bandwidth requirements, delay budgets, deployment costs, complexity of radio remote head, and the ability to support advanced wireless functions. In order to analyze the deployment cost of entire 5G transport and wireless networks, we develop a joint optimization framework to optimally deploy fiber-based fronthaul network and 5G wireless network simultaneously. Our framework is also capable of setting limits on the required network coverage and capacity. We analyze the optimal deployment costs under different deployment scenarios and different fronthaul technologies. Our analyses provide insights into modeling future-proof optical transport networks to realize 5G network deployment.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2782822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2782822","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8307216/08194738.pdf","startPage":"2059","endPage":"2068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5G C-RAN With Optical Fronthaul: An Analysis From a Deployment Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"5G C-RAN With Optical Fronthaul: An Analysis From a Deployment Perspective","volume":"36","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1, 1 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8194738/","publicationDate":"1 June1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17614474","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194738/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5G C-RAN With Optical Fronthaul: An Analysis From a Deployment Perspective","sourcePdf":"jlt-ranaweera-2782822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060995S","chronDate":"June1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8307216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8307216","articleId":"8194738","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8194739,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqiang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0002-6974-7327","id":"37086183966"},{"name":"Miaomiao Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Miaomiao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086313923"},{"name":"Guang Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai Aerospace Control Technology Institute, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086313178"},{"name":"Jonathan Cheung-Wai Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jonathan Cheung-Wai","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085381066"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"8194739","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":515},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"495 KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/8233353/8194739/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2783039.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/8233353/8194739/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2783039.jpg"},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FOV Expansion of Bioinspired Multiband Polarimetric Imagers With Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Spectral and polarimetric contents of the light reflected from an object contain useful information on material type and surface characteristics of the object. Jointly exploiting spatial, spectral, and polarimetric information helps detect camouflage targets. Motivated by the vision mechanism of some known aquatic insects, we construct a bioinspired multiband polarimetric imaging system using a camera array, which simultaneously captures multiple images of different spectral bands and polarimetric angles. But the disparity between the fixed positions of each component camera leads to the loss of information in the boundary region and a reduction in the field of view (FOV). In order to overcome the limits, this paper presents a deep learning method for FOV expansion, incorporating the gradient prior of the image into a nine-dimensional convolutional neural network's framework to learn end-to-end mapping between the incomplete images and the FOV-expanded images. With FOV expansion, the proposed model recovers significant missing information. For the problem of insufficient training data, we construct the training dataset and propose the corresponding training methods to achieve good convergence of the network. We also provide some experimental results to validate its state-of-the-art performance of FOV expansion.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Image reconstruction","Training","Feature extraction","Biomedical imaging","Band-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","cameras","image sensors","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","optical engineering computing","polarimetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FOV-expanded images","nine-dimensional convolutional neural network","deep learning method","camera array","bioinspired multiband polarimetric imaging system","aquatic insects","vision mechanism","camouflage target detection","polarimetric information","spectral information","spatial information","convolutional neural networks","bioinspired multiband polarimetric imagers","FOV expansion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bio-inspired vision","multiband polarization imaging","convolutional neural networks","FOV expansion."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194739","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2783039","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8233353/08194739.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2783039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194739/","displayDocTitle":"FOV Expansion of Bioinspired Multiband Polarimetric Imagers With Convolutional Neural Networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2018","isJournal":true,"externalId":"6800214","accessionNumber":"17481876","htmlLink":"/document/8194739/","impactStatement":"Motivated by the aquatic insects, we bulit a bio-inspired multiband polarimetric imaging system.

The method uses an equivalent magnetic dipole array deduced from near-field scanning results obtained at a certain height over the PCB surface under test and the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) algorithm. The array of dipoles can simulate the PCB electromagnetic emissions, including the ground plane effect at a particular high frequency; the equivalent dipole array can then be imported into the FDTD calculation space for calculating the electromagnetic fields generated by the dipole array. In our experiment, we obtained the tangential magnetic field distribution of the PCB surface using near-field scanning, from where the tangential magnetic field component, orientation, and the magnitude and phase of the dipoles could be deduced. We used the proposed method to model two different modules on a highly integrated circuit. The results of the proposed method and those obtained by near-field scanning are nearly the same, which demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. We therefore conclude that the proposed modeling approach presents a new technique for studying the electromagnetic interference of PCBs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Prediction Method for the Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Printed Circuit Boards Based on the Equivalent Dipole Model and the Finite-Difference Time Domain Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782879","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08194823.pdf","startPage":"6520","endPage":"6529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194823","topic":"Data-Driven Monitoring, Fault Diagnosis and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Prediction Method for the Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Printed Circuit Boards Based on the Equivalent Dipole Model and the Finite-Difference Time Domain Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8194823/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17612364","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China subsidization project","grantNumber":"51579047"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005046","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province","grantNumber":"QC2017048"},{"fundingName":"National Defense Technology Fundamental Research Funds","grantNumber":"JSHS2015604C002"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Harbin","grantNumber":"2016RAQXJ077"},{"fundingName":"Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves","grantNumber":"K201707"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Hybrid Prediction Method for the Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Printed Circuit Boards Based on the Equivalent Dipole Model and the Finite-Difference Time Domain Method","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2782879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071823S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Data-Driven Monitoring, Fault Diagnosis and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems"],"articleId":"8194823","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8194826,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Xiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/8167073/8194826/xiang-2782839-small.gif","p":["Chen Xiang was born in Yichang, China.

Sequential data, such as time series/video frames, and event data are becoming more and more ubiquitous in a wide spectrum of application scenarios especially in the background of large data and deep learning. However, large data sets used in training modern machine-learning models, such as deep neural networks, are often affected by label noise. Existing noisy learning approaches mainly focus on building an additional network to clean the noise or find a robust loss function. Few works tackle this problem by exploiting sample correlations. In this paper, we propose BundleNet, a framework of sequential structure (named bundle-module, see Fig. 1) for deep neural networks to handle the label noise. The bundle module naturally takes into account sample correlations by constructing bundles of samples class-by-class, and treats them as independent inputs. Moreover, we prove that the bundle-module performs a form of regularization, which is similar to dropout as regularization during training. The regularization effect endows the BundleNet with strong robustness to the label noise. Extensive experiments on public data sets prove that the proposed approach is effective and promising.","topic":"Sequential Data Modeling and Its Emerging Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8194827/","accessionNumber":"17612573","displayDocTitle":"BundleNet: Learning with Noisy Label via Sample Correlations","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61332016"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis Technology"},{"fundingName":"863 Program","grantNumber":"2014AA015105"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"BundleNet: Learning with Noisy Label via Sample Correlations","sourcePdf":"access-li-2782844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147541S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Sequential Data Modeling and Its Emerging Applications"],"articleId":"8194827","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8194829,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Fang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Yu-Fang Huang was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1992.

Lengthening the seawater distance to 10.2 m only decreases the transmission data rate by 4 Gbps, as caused by the frquency response limitation of the used avalanche photodiode. To optimize the QAM-OFDM transmission, the sampling rate of the encoded data is compromised to avoid the aliasing and oversampling effects during the waveform extraction procedure. The sampling rate is optimized to 3-5 times of the encoded data bandwidth for suppressing peak-to-average power ratio. Oversampling not only filters out background noise but also attenuates data amplitude to degrade transmission performance. Without using the multicarrier spectrally filtered OFDM, the 16-QAM OFDM data format only promotes the transmission capacity of BLD up to 7.6 Gbps in seawater. With spectrally filtering out the sidelobes of each OFDM subcarrier, the allowable modulation bandwidth is greatly improved from 1.9 to 2.7 GHz, as the intercarrier interference induced crosstalk between subbands is relieved to improve the SNR of the carried data with a raw data rate of up to 10.8 Gbps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filtered Multicarrier OFDM Encoding on Blue Laser Diode for 14.8-Gbps Seawater Transmission","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2782840","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8303833/08194829.pdf","startPage":"1739","endPage":"1745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2782840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8303833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Filtered Multicarrier OFDM Encoding on Blue Laser Diode for 14.8-Gbps Seawater Transmission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8194829/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2018","publicationDate":"1 May1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17599874","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST-104-2221-E-002-117-MY3, MOST-106-2221-E-002-152-MY3 and MOST-106-2218-E-005-001-"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filtered Multicarrier OFDM Encoding on Blue Laser Diode for 14.8-Gbps Seawater Transmission","sourcePdf":"jlt-lin-2782840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068474S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8303833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8303833","articleId":"8194829","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8194835,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Nakayama","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8194835/nakay-2783050-small.gif","p":["Yu Nakayama (M\u201910) received the B.A. and M.E. degrees in agriculture and environmental studies from The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

To quickly recover telecommunication services in the affected area, this paper proposes a wired and wireless network cooperation system. When the wired communication for leaf nodes of optical tree networks is disrupted, surviving leaf nodes relay packets to and from these nodes via wireless bypass routes. The advantages of the proposed method are promptness and high-throughput, which is achieved with single-hop wireless bypass routes backhauled by wired networks. The optimal routes for wireless links are calculated to maximize the expected throughput by solving a binary integer programming problem. The proposed system is cost effective, because it can be deployed with minimum additional functions for leaf nodes of optical networks. To overcome the limitation of the proposed approach that the distribution of leaf nodes is determined by the demand distribution, additional recovery nodes can be deployed to improve the expected throughput. The numerical simulations including a medium access control level simulation conducting carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance behavior showed that the proposed method can achieve a higher throughput than an existing bypass routing method, irrespective of the topology of the wired networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08194835.pdf","startPage":"2410","endPage":"2424","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wired and Wireless Network Cooperation for Wide-Area Quick Disaster Recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Wired and Wireless Network Cooperation for Wide-Area Quick Disaster Recovery","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8194835/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542724","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194835/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wired and Wireless Network Cooperation for Wide-Area Quick Disaster Recovery","sourcePdf":"access-nakayama-2783050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109968S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8194835","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8194836,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Brown","affiliation":["School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8194836/brown-2782778-small.gif","p":["Alexander Brown received the B.Sc. degree in applied mathematics and the B.Comp. degree in 2016, and the B.ICT.

An issue currently proving problematic with the automatic analysis of bird recordings is interference from noise that can mask vocalizations of interest. As such, noise reduction can greatly increase the accuracy of automatic analyses and reduce processing work for subsequent steps in bioacoustics analyses. However, only limited work has been done in the context of bird recordings. Most semiautomatic methods either manually apply sound enhancement methods available in audio processing systems such as SoX and Audacity or apply preliminary filters such as lowand highpass filters. These methods are insufficient both in terms of how generically they can be applied and their integration with automatic systems that need to process large amounts of data. Some other work applied more sophisticated denoising methods or combinations of different methods such as minimum mean square error short-time spectral amplitude estimator (MMSE STSA) and spectral subtraction for other species such as anurans. However, their effectiveness is not tested on bird recordings. In this paper, we analyze the applicability of the MMSE STSA algorithm to remove noise from environmental recordings containing bird sounds, particularly focusing on its quality and processing time. The experimental evaluation using real data clearly shows that MMSE STSA can reduce noise with similar effectiveness [using objective metrics such as predicted signal quality (SIG)] to a previously recommended wavelet-transform-based denoising technique while executing between approximately 5-300 times faster depending on the audio files tested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194836/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8194836/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17612574","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Automatic and Efficient Denoising of Bioacoustics Recordings Using MMSE STSA","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Automatic and Efficient Denoising of Bioacoustics Recordings Using MMSE STSA","sourcePdf":"access-garg-2782778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078063S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8194836","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8194846,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Information Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8194846/yang-2782814-small.gif","p":["Jie Yang received the B.S. degree in intelligent science and technology from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education.","His current research interests include evolutionary algorithms, data mining, and complex networks."]},"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-2686-2878","id":"37086285708"},{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Information Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8194846/liu-2782814-small.gif","p":["Jing Liu (SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology and the Ph.D. degree in circuits and systems from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.","In 2005, she joined Xidian University as a Lecturer, and then was promoted to a Full Professor in 2009.

As a key issue in viral marketing, this problem has been extensively studied in the literature. However, despite a great deal of work that has been done, the traditional influence maximization model cannot fully capture the characteristics of real-world networks, since it usually assumes that the cost of activating each individual among the seed set is the same and ignores the cost differences of activating them. In fact, if a company plans to market its products or ideas, it always provides the reward for each disseminator of the seed group according to his or her degree of influence spread. All companies expect to obtain the maximum influence with minimum cost, or acceptable cost, for them. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new model, called influence maximization-cost minimization (IM-CM), which can capture the characteristics of real-world networks better. To solve this new model, we propose a multiobjective discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for IM-CM. The algorithm can take both individual cost and individual influence into consideration. Besides, the results of this algorithm can also provide a variety of choices for decision makers to choose on the basis of their budgets. Finally, experiments on three real-world networks demonstrate that our algorithm has excellent effectiveness and efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Social network services","Minimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle swarm optimization","Companies","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traditional influence maximization model","real-world networks","cost differences","seed group","acceptable cost","called influence maximization-cost minimization","multiobjective discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm","individual cost","individual influence","social networks","largest influence spread","viral marketing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Influence maximization","cost minimization","multiobjective discrete particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194846","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782814","startPage":"2320","endPage":"2329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08194846.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194846/","displayDocTitle":"Influence Maximization-Cost Minimization in Social Networks Based on a Multiobjective Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17542727","htmlLink":"/document/8194846/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Outstanding Young Scholar Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61522311"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"General Program of NSFC","grantNumber":"61773300"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Overseas, Hong Kong and Macao Scholars Collaborated Research Program of NSFC","grantNumber":"61528205"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Key Program of Fundamental Research Project of Natural Science of Shaanxi Province, China","grantNumber":"2017JZ017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Influence Maximization-Cost Minimization in Social Networks Based on a Multiobjective Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","sourcePdf":"access-yang-2782814-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134086S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8194846","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8194847,"authors":[{"name":"Mahyar Nemati","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8194847/nemat-2782830-small.gif","p":["Mahyar Nemati (S\u201917\u2013M\u201917) was born in Arak, Iran, in 1992.

The current symbol boundary alignment, along with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, strongly suffers from intercarrier interference (ICI) especially in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) communications. This happens when the mobility causes Doppler effect which results in loss of orthogonality in OFDM. The available solutions for overcoming the ICI problem suffer from high complexity, low spectral efficiency, and incompatibility with the current radio access technologies. This paper presents a novel symbol boundary alignment, called Low ICI Symbol (LICIS) boundary alignment numerology, to avoid the disadvantages of the available solutions. LICIS utilizes large subcarrier-spacing to reduce the ICI power (e.g., around 5-dB ICI power reduction with subcarrier spacing of 30 kHz in high-speed UAV communications). Moreover, LICIS is based on the same reference clock as local thermal equilibrium (LTE) which guarantees its compatibility with the current LTE numerology. In addition, this approach places only one guard-interval at the end of a sequence of OFDM symbols and creates a subslot. This leads to less overhead and preserves the spectral efficiency. Furthermore, a pre-fast Fourier transform (FFT) multipath channel equalizer is considered for removing the intersymbol interference between the OFDM symbols occurring within the subslot. Only one additional FFT and IFFT operations are required for the equalizer which creates an acceptable complexity increment compared to the complexity of other available solutions. Numerical and analytical evaluations show the superior performance of the proposed technique in terms of reliability and spectral efficiency","topic":"Networks of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Wireless Communications, Applications, Control and Modelling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194847/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","accessionNumber":"17542728","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8194847/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low ICI Symbol Boundary Alignment for 5G Numerology Design","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Low ICI Symbol Boundary Alignment for 5G Numerology Design","sourcePdf":"access-nemati-2782830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069567S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Networks of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Wireless Communications, Applications, Control and Modelling"],"articleId":"8194847","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8194849,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Garc\u00eda-Morales","affiliation":["Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, ES"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8194849/garci-2782943-small.gif","p":["Jan Garc\u00eda-Morales (S\u201914) was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba,\n on 1984.

Fractional and soft frequency reuse (FFR, SFR) constitute two powerful mechanisms for intercell interference coordination that have been already adopted by emerging cellular deployments as an efficient way to improve the throughput performance perceived by cell-edge users. This paper presents a novel optimal fifth-percentile user rate constrained design for FFR/SFR-based networks that, by appropriately dimensioning the center and edge regions of the cell, rightly splitting the available bandwidth among these two areas while assigning the corresponding transmit power, allows a tradeoff between cell throughput performance and fairness to be established. To this end, both the cumulative distribution function of the user throughput and the average spectral efficiency of the system are derived assuming the use of the ubiquitous proportional fair scheduling policy. The mathematical framework is then used to obtain numerical results showing that the novel proposed design clearly outperforms previous schemes in terms of throughput fairness control due to a more rational compromise between average cell throughput and cell-edge ICIC.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2782943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08194849.pdf","startPage":"3406","endPage":"3419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2782943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Analysis and Optimization of a Fifth-Percentile User Rate Constrained Design for FFR/SFR-Aided OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194849/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Analysis and Optimization of a Fifth-Percentile User Rate Constrained Design for FFR/SFR-Aided OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","volume":"67","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17713527","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8194849/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Agencia Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regiona","grantNumber":"TEC2014-59255-C3-2-R"},{"fundingName":"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad"},{"fundingName":"Conselleria d\u2019Educaci\u00f3","grantNumber":"FPI/1538/2013"},{"fundingName":"European Social Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Analysis and Optimization of a Fifth-Percentile User Rate Constrained Design for FFR/SFR-Aided OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-femenias-2782943-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108902S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8194849","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8194850,"authors":[{"name":"Qingchen Liu","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8736908/8194850/liu-2772820-small.gif","p":["Qingchen Liu received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in control engineering from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

We first propose two model-independent algorithms for a subclass of Euler- Lagrange agents without the vector of gravitational potential forces. By model-independent, we mean that each agent can execute its algorithm with no knowledge of the agent self-dynamics. A variable-gain algorithm is employed when the sensing graph is undirected; algorithm parameters are selected in a fully distributed manner with much greater flexibility compared to all previous work studying event-triggered consensus problems. When the sensing graph is directed, a constant-gain algorithm is employed. The control gains must be centrally designed to exceed several lower bounding inequalities, which require limited knowledge of bounds on the matrices describing the agent dynamics, bounds on network topology information, and bounds on the initial conditions. When the Euler-Lagrange agents have dynamics that include the vector of gravitational potential forces, an adaptive algorithm is proposed. This requires more information about the agent dynamics but allows for the estimation of uncertain parameters associated with the agent self-dynamics. For each algorithm, a trigger function is proposed to govern the event update times. The controller is only updated at each event, which ensures that the control input is piecewise constant and thus saves energy resources. We analyze each controller and trigger function to exclude Zeno behavior.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Triggered Algorithms for Leader\u2013Follower Consensus of Networked Euler\u2013Lagrange

Distributed Antenna Systems","abstract":"In this study, we investigate distributed antenna systems (DASs) with partial channel state information (CSI). In the DAS considered here, one control unit coordinates multiple baseband units (BBUs), and each BBU with multiple distributed antennas (DAs) knows only the direct channels from its DAs to its associated users and supports them simultaneously. For fairness among users, a distributed precoder structure is designed to maximize the upper bound of the minimum user rate, under the assumption that the direct channel dominates the intra-BBU interfering links. We then propose a distributed general precoder that allows multiple BBUs to serve multiple users simultaneously. Numerical results verify that, in terms of the minimum and average achievable rates, the proposed scheme significantly outperforms an existing scheme in which each BBU supports a single user. The results also demonstrate that the proposed scheme is comparable to a full-CSI based scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8194852/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699008","volume":"67","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Precoder Design With Direct-Link Channel Information for Distributed Antenna Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Korean government","grantNumber":"2016R1D1A1B03930250"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Precoder Design With Direct-Link Channel Information for Distributed Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-joung-2783219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113162S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8194852","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8194861,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhua Cui","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8467416/8194861/cui-2782765-small.gif","p":["Jinhua Cui received the B.S. degree from Southwest University, Chongqing, China, in 2012.

While 3-D flash improves cell density and reduces lithography cost through die stacking, it suffers from severe program disturbance, which leads to significant performance and lifetime degradation for 3-D flash-based SSDs. To address the above challenge, we propose ApproxFTL, an approximate-write aware flash translation layer design, that uses approximate-write operations to store error-resilient data of modern applications. By reducing the maximal threshold voltage and tightening the guard bands between multilevel cell states, approximate write operations not only finish early but also exhibit large disturbance reduction, which can be exploited to alleviate disturbance in physical blocks that save both precise and approximate data. ApproxFTL maximizes the disturbance mitigation through approximate-write aware data placement, wear leveling, and garbage collection enhancements. Our experimental results show that ApproxFTL, while preserving high data quality, improves the read and write response time of flash accesses by 41.38% and 45.64% on average, respectively, and extends the lifetime of 3-D flash-based SSDs by 5.75% when comparing to the state-of-the-art.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/8467416/8194861-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","volume":"37","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"18095268","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8194861/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"ApproxFTL: On the Performance and Lifetime Improvement of 3-D NAND Flash-Based SSDs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1000303 and 2016YFB0201800"},{"fundingName":"Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macau Young Scientists of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61628210"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91630206, 61672423 and 61772092"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1718080"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Program","grantNumber":"2015AA015304"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201606280098"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"ApproxFTL: On the Performance and Lifetime Improvement of 3-D NAND Flash-Based SSDs","sourcePdf":"tcad-cui-2782765-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127493S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8467416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8467416","articleId":"8194861","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8194863,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Jamali","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/8264912/8194863/jamal-2782761-small.gif","p":["Vahid Jamali (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees (Hons.) in electrical engineering from the K.

In this paper, we develop several symbol synchronization schemes for molecular communication (MC) systems where we consider some practical challenges, which have not been addressed in the literature yet. In particular, we take into account that in MC systems, the transmitter may not be equipped with an internal clock and may not be able to emit molecules with a fixed release frequency. Such restrictions hold for practical nanotransmitters, e.g., modified cells, where the lengths of the symbol intervals may vary due to the inherent randomness in the availability of food and energy for molecule generation, the process for molecule production, and the release process. To address this issue, we develop two synchronization-detection frameworks which both employ two types of molecule. In the first framework, one type of molecule is used for symbol synchronization and the other one is used for data detection, whereas in the second framework, both types of molecule are used for joint symbol synchronization and data detection. For both frameworks, we first derive the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) symbol synchronization schemes as performance upper bounds. Since ML synchronization entails high complexity, for each framework, we also propose three low-complexity suboptimal schemes, namely a linear filter-based scheme, a peak observation-based scheme, and a threshold-trigger scheme, which are suitable for MC systems with limited computational capabilities. Furthermore, we study the relative complexity and the constraints associated with the proposed schemes and the impact of the insertion and deletion errors that arise due to imperfect synchronization. Our simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization schemes and suggest that the end-to-end performance of MC systems significantly depends on the accuracy of the symbol synchronization.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2017.2782761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Moreover, heterogeneous hardware integration in these systems is a very complex task, and different approaches attempting to standardize this integration are under development and use. One of these approaches is areaDetector (AD), which involves an open source module for EPICS that is primarily used for image acquisition applications. AD simplifies the integration of heterogeneous image acquisition systems, providing a common interface between the hardware and EPICS. The AD community has already developed support for different cameras and communication protocols as well as different processing modules, including conversion to the most commonly used image formats. AD has also been used in some analog signal acquisition systems; for example, quadEM is typically used for a photodiode-based X-ray beam, but there are no implementations based on FPGA, such as FlexRIO technology. This paper presents the integration of acquisition and processing solution in a PXIe platform using the FlexRIO technology using a model that solves the acquisition and signal processing in an FPGA and a software layer implemented in C++ with the IRIO library (open source solution for RIO devices in the Linux environment).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17595213","htmlLink":"/document/8194874/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2018","volume":"65","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Solutions for Analog Data Acquisition and Processing Integrated in Area Detector Using FlexRIO Technology","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","grantNumber":"N\u00b0 ENE2015-64914-C3-3-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Solutions for Analog Data Acquisition and Processing Integrated in Area Detector Using FlexRIO Technology","sourcePdf":"tns-herrero-2782827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054715S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"8291031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8291031","articleId":"8194874","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8194883,"authors":[{"name":"Guannan Dong","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Guannan","lastName":"Dong","orcid":"0000-0003-2625-9443","id":"37085780721"},{"name":"Haixia Zhang","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Haixia","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-5081-7287","id":"37280795800"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085343718"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8194883","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1571},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Antennas","Fading channels","Uplink","Downlink","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","energy harvesting","MIMO communication","Rician channels","telecommunication power management","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink achievable rate","Rician channels","massive MIMO SWIPT systems","transmission channels","Rician fading channels","massive multiple-input-multiple-output system","line-of-sight","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer systems","transmit antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","SWIPT","Power Split","Achievable Rate"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates the downlink achievable rates of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems.

While TCAMs can achieve fast matching, they are plagued by high update costs that can make them unusable in a high churn rate environment. We present, in this paper, a systematic and in-depth analysis of the TCAM update problem. We apply partial order theory to derive fundamental constraints on any rule ordering on TCAMs, which ensures correct checking against a given ruleset. This theoretical insight enables us to fully explore the TCAM update algorithms design space, to derive the optimal TCAM update algorithm (though it might not be suitable to be used in practice), and to obtain upper and lower bounds on the performance of practical update algorithms. Having lower bounds, we checked if the smallest update costs are compatible with the churn rate observed in practice, and we observed that this is not always the case. We therefore developed a heuristic based on ruleset splitting, with more than a single TCAM chip, that achieves significant update cost reductions (1.05~11.3\u00d7) compared with state-of-the-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2017.2776565","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/8291715/08194889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2017.2776565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291715","startPage":"217","endPage":"230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Order Theory for Fast TCAM Updates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partial Order Theory for Fast TCAM Updates","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17578199","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8194889/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502458 and 61725206"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing","grantNumber":"4162057"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Order Theory for Fast TCAM Updates","sourcePdf":"tnet-he-2776565-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112679S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"8291715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8291715","articleId":"8194889","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8194895,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Internet Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/9346133/8194895/zhang-2782794-small.gif","p":["Yang Zhang received the PhD degree in computer applied technology from Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2007.

Work to date has not comprehensively explored how to flexibly construct distributed IoT services to satisfy the coordination requirement. In our work, we propose a declarative approach to construct an event-driven IoT service system, where physical devices and systems are explicitly modeled as a service architecture foundation, the service behavior is flexibly declared based on distributed events, and it is step-by-step refined to have rigid service properties while allowing runtime adaptation. As an example, the controllability property of physical systems is discussed. Finally, we establish a distributed event-driven IoT service platform to test our method. Some experiments are performed to concept-prove our work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","volume":"14","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"20406079","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2021","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/8194895/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Declarative Construction of Distributed Event-Driven IoT Services Based on IoT Resource Models","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372115"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech R&D Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2013AA102301"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Declarative Construction of Distributed Event-Driven IoT Services Based on IoT Resource Models","sourcePdf":"tsc-zhang-2782794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.340714S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9346133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9346133","articleId":"8194895","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8194898,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Frey","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/8714098/8194898/frey-2782813-small.gif","p":["Sylvain Frey is a software engineer at Google UK.

We studied and contrasted the security decisions of three demographics-security experts, computer scientists and managers-when playing a tabletop game that we designed and developed. The game tasks players with managing the security of a cyber-physical environment while facing various threats. Analysis of 12 groups of players (4 groups in each of our demographics) reveals strategies that repeat in particular demographics, e.g., managers and security experts generally favoring technological solutions over personnel training, which computer scientists preferred. Surprisingly, security experts were not ipso facto better players-in some cases, they made very questionable decisions-yet they showed a higher level of confidence in themselves. We classified players' decision-making processes, i.e., procedure-, experience-, scenario- or intuition-driven. We identified decision patterns, both good practices and typical errors and pitfalls. Our game provides a requirements sandbox in which players can experiment with security risks, learn about decision-making and its consequences, and reflect on their own perception of security.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2017.2782813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2017.2782813","startPage":"521","endPage":"536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/8714098/08194898.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8714098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: A Study of Security Decisions in a Cyber-Physical Systems Game","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: A Study of Security Decisions in a Cyber-Physical Systems Game","volume":"45","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18670175","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8194898/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M002780/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: A Study of Security Decisions in a Cyber-Physical Systems Game","sourcePdf":"tse-frey-2782813-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088792S","chronDate":"May 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"8714098","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8714098","articleId":"8194898","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8194904,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Cheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8371343/8194904/lin-2782845-small.gif","p":["Chun-Cheng Lin (S\u201906\u2013M\u201908\u2013SM\u201917)\n received the B.S. degree in mathematics, the M.B.A. degree in business administration, and the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2000, 2007, and 2009, respectively.","He has been a Professor of industrial engineering and management since 2016 and an Associate Dean of the College of\n Management since 2017 at National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan, which he joined as an Assistant\n Professor in 2011.

The Internet of energy (IoE) effectively improves networking of distributed green energies through extending smart grids with bidirectional transmission of energy and distributed renewable energy facilities. Previous works on the IoE focused on decisions of IoE operators or optimization of the whole system. However, few considered optimal decisions of a single end user in the IoE. Therefore, this work creates a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for a single end user that considers green energy generation, an energy storage, an electric vehicle, and an IoE-based energy trading platform to reduce energy waste. This model considers a complete system of charging control of multiple facilities of a single end user in the IoE, and allows the end user to purchase energy and sell green energy through the IoE, in which the energy prices of the electrical grid and the IoE platform are set by the power company and the energy market, respectively. Because MILP is NP complete and the proposed model involves a large number of variables and constraints, this paper further proposes a genetic algorithm for this problem, in which a repairing scheme is proposed to handle solution infeasibility of all constraints. By simulation, the proposed algorithm is verified to effectively reduce energy waste.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","volume":"14","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"17806922","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8194904/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Charging Control of Energy Storage and Electric Vehicle of an Individual in the Internet of Energy With Energy Trading","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"106-2221-E-009-101-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Charging Control of Energy Storage and Electric Vehicle of an Individual in the Internet of Energy With Energy Trading","sourcePdf":"tii-deng-2782845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079793S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8371343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8371343","articleId":"8194904","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8194908,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Gu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Gu","id":"37085640075"},{"name":"He Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-8886-9680","id":"37539867600"},{"name":"Yonghui Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279887100"},{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingyang","lastName":"Song","orcid":"0000-0001-8644-8241","id":"37288632100"},{"name":"Branka Vucetic","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Branka","lastName":"Vucetic","id":"37278594000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8194908","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":762},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194908","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Error analysis","Channel coding","Relay networks (telecommunications)","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","approximation theory","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-packet communications","three-node TWRN","finite blocklength regime","approximate closed-form expressions","sum-block error rate","simple asymptotic expressions","sum-BLER performance","three time slots scheme","two time slots scheme","amplify-and-forward two-way relay network","conductance 3.0 TS","conductance 2.0 TS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite blocklength","short-packet communication","two-way relay","ultrareliable and low-latency communication"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates an amplify-and-forward two-way relay network (TWRN) for short-packet communications.

Based on the asymptotic expressions, we analytically compare the sum-BLER performance of 2TS and 3TS schemes, and attain an expression of critical blocklength, which can determine the performance superiority of 2TS and 3TS in terms of sum-BLER. Extensive simulations are provided to validate our theoretical analysis.

propose an analog cooperative beamforming (ACB) technique using random antenna arrays for physical-layer (PHY) secure communications, where the array elements are assumed to be uniformly distributed in a spherical volume. Motivated by the fact that the sidelobe of radiating elements at undesired directions can be used for eavesdropping, the proposed ACB aims at randomizing the radiation pattern at the undesired directions for PHY secure communications. To achieve this aim, it allows the radiating elements to be randomly selected and adapt their phases to a desired direction. To evaluate the PHY security performance, we derive the average secrecy capacity by subtracting the channel capacity for a given undesired direction from that for a desired direction. The analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed ACB outperforms the existing PHY security technique with a fixed antenna array especially when its array elements are widely dispersed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","volume":"22","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17614392","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8194912/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analog Cooperative Beamforming With Spherically-Bound Random Arrays for Physical-Layer Secure Communications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002628","fundingName":"Incheon National University Research Grant in 2017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Cooperative Beamforming With Spherically-Bound Random Arrays for Physical-Layer Secure Communications","sourcePdf":"lcomm-lee-2782807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0502S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8309483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8309483","articleId":"8194912","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8194918,"authors":[{"name":"Naihao Liu","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Offshore Oil Exploration, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China","Department of Geological Sciences, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Naihao","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-2609-7408","id":"37086094757"},{"name":"Jinghuai Gao","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Offshore Oil Exploration, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jinghuai","lastName":"Gao","id":"37310259600"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Geological Sciences, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086324463"},{"name":"Fangyu Li","affiliation":["College of Engineering, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA","ConocoPhillips School of Geology and Geophysics, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Fangyu","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-2340-3622","id":"37086322039"},{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Offshore Oil Exploration, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-9298-5913","id":"37086100323"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"8194918","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":594},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Transforms","Standards","Signal resolution","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","hydrocarbon reservoirs","seismology","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three parameters S transform","time-frequency analysis algorithms","seismic data","optimized TF resolution","TF spectrum","hydrocarbon detection","reservoir characterization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["S transform (ST)","seismic time\u2013frequency (TF) analysis","three parameters S transform (TPST)"]}],"abstract":"The S transform (ST) is one of the most commonly used time-frequency (TF) analysis algorithms and is commonly used in assisting reservoir characterization and hydrocarbon detection.

In this letter, we propose a three parameters ST (TPST) to optimize the TF resolution flexibly. To demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the TPST, we first apply it to a synthetic data and a synthetic seismic trace and then to a filed data. Synthetic data examples show that this TPST achieves an optimized TF resolution, compared with the standard ST and modified ST with two parameters. Field data experiments illustrate that the TPST is superior to the ST in highlighting the channel edges. The lateral continuity of the frequency slice produced by the TPST is more continuous than that of the ST.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2017.2778045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/8240808/08194918.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2017.2778045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time\u2013Frequency Analysis of Seismic Data Using a Three Parameters S Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194918/","displayDocTitle":"Time\u2013Frequency Analysis of Seismic Data Using a Three Parameters S Transform","volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17435641","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8194918/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41390450 and 41390454"},{"fundingName":"Major National Science and Technology Projects","grantNumber":"2016ZX05024-001-007 and 2017ZX050609"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time\u2013Frequency Analysis of Seismic Data Using a Three Parameters S Transform","sourcePdf":"lgrs-liu-2778045-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047984S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8240808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8240808","articleId":"8194918","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8194933,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Nabil Fathy Ibrahim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Energy, Metals, Mechanical Constructions and Systems, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/8440861/8194933/ibrah-2782777-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Nabil Fathy Ibrahim received the Ph.D. degree in\n electromechancial engineering from Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, in December 2017.

The conventional star winding is used as a benchmark in this study to compare different possible single-layer winding layouts. Among these different winding layouts, those which maximize the fundamental magneto-motive force component are selected. A simple mathematical formula is then derived to calculate the equivalent winding factor for different shares between star and delta subwindings. It has been proved that for the same copper volume and line current magnitude, the star-delta connection can offer an enhancement in the torque density of approximately 5.2% over the conventional star case under rated conditions. However, this gain is affected by the employed number of poles and stator slots. On the other hand, the effect of the winding layout on either power factor or core loss can be merely neglected over a wide range of speeds and currents. Nevertheless, the machine efficiency under a combined star-delta connection is relatively improved under light loading as a result to the machine torque/current ratio enhancement. The theoretical findings are experimentally validated using two identical 5.5 kW prototype machines, having star and combined star-delta winding connections.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/8440861/08194933.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1024","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2017.2782777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2017.2782777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8440861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Torque Density Synchronous Reluctance Machine With a Combined Star\u2013Delta Winding Layout","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Layout","Torque","Coils","Stator windings","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power factor","reluctance motors","stators","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous reluctance motors","combined star-delta winding layout","fundamental magneto-motive force component","simple mathematical formula","equivalent winding factor","line current magnitude","improved torque density synchronous reluctance machine","single-layer winding layouts","delta subwinding","machine torque-current ratio enhancement","power 5.5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Combined star-delta","dual three-phase winding","FEM","winding factor","synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Torque Density Synchronous Reluctance Machine With a Combined Star\u2013Delta Winding Layout","volume":"33","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8194933/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18043029","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002385","fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education"},{"fundingName":"Special Research Fund of Ghent University (BOF)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Torque Density Synchronous Reluctance Machine With a Combined Star\u2013Delta Winding Layout","sourcePdf":"tec-ibrahim-2782777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084658S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"8440861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8440861","articleId":"8194933","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":8194934,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Yang","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8478838/8194934/yang-2771465-small.gif","p":["Jian Yang (S\u201915) was born in Yinin, China, in 1988.

A two-layered CDR mechanism is proposed, which aims at guaranteeing safe separation, minimizing the overall cost of UAVs, and improving computational efficiency. In the first layer, the information from the environment is processed. In the second layer, conflicts among UAVs are resolved by applying the local centralized optimization method, with consideration given to the dynamic constraints of UAVs. This paper studies the safe separation constraints of pairwise conflicts in virtue of a geometry-based method. A heading change and speed change mixed conflict resolution approach is applied. To meet with the online planning requirements, the vectorized stochastic parallel gradient descent-based method is proposed to find the local optimal heading change solutions. The linear safe separation constraints on speeds are derived. A periodicity feature-based method is used to depart the feasible sub-regions for each pairwise conflict. A mixed integer linear programming model is established to find the optimal speed change solutions. The experiments results show that the proposed heading change algorithm could greatly reduce the summation of additional flight distances of UAVs, and influences on air traffic, compared with other short-term algorithms; the computational efficiency of this algorithm satisfies the online planning requirement. Comparing with the existing algorithm, our speed change algorithm reduces the number of feasible sub-regions to 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nc</sup>\n times lower, where n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n is the number of pairwise conflict, and therefore, it reduces computation time dramatically.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2017.2771465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8478838/08194934.pdf","startPage":"3230","endPage":"3244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2017.2771465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8478838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Layered Mechanism of Online Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Conflict Detection and Resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8194934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8194934/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Layered Mechanism of Online Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Conflict Detection and Resolution","volume":"19","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18133075","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8194934/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403410"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M552687"},{"fundingName":"Graduate Student Innovation Project of Hunan Province","grantNumber":"CX2014B013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Layered Mechanism of Online Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Conflict Detection and Resolution","sourcePdf":"tits-yang-2771465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18411S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8478838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8478838","articleId":"8194934","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8194936,"authors":[{"name":"Asil Koc","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Asil","lastName":"Koc","orcid":"0000-0002-8757-0377","id":"37085811960"},{"name":"Ibrahim Altunbas","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Altunbas","orcid":"0000-0002-3639-3729","id":"37443120300"},{"name":"Ertugrul Basar","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ertugrul","lastName":"Basar","orcid":"0000-0001-5566-2392","id":"38666344600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8194936","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":841},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Radio frequency","Silicon","Wireless communication","Protocols","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","energy harvesting","error statistics","interference suppression","Monte Carlo methods","network coding","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical-layer network coding","power-splitting protocol","external power supply","upper-bound bit error rate expression","half-duplex transmission schemes","Monte Carlo type computer simulations","full-duplex cooperative system","energy harvesting","wireless powered AF relaying","two-way full-duplex spatial modulation systems","fixed-gain amplify-and-forward relaying techniques","simultaneous information and wireless power transfer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","two-way full-duplex","spatial modulation","amplify-and-forward","power-splitting"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a dual-hop two-way full-duplex cooperative system, where spatial modulation is used at the sources and energy harvesting is employed at the wireless powered relay.

Based on the properties of the Rice distribution and dubbed modified asymptotic, it meets several desirable criteria: (i) its values lie in the whole positive region; (ii) its distribution is continuous; (iii) it transforms smoothly with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from a Rayleigh-like shape to a Gaussian one; (iv) it is unbiased and reaches its components\u2019 variance as soon as the SNR exceeds 2; and (v) it is analytic and can therefore be used on large data sets. We also revisit the construction of its associated confidence intervals and show how the Feldman\u2013Cousins prescription efficiently solves the issue of classical intervals lying entirely in the unphysical negative domain. Such intervals can be used to identify statistically significant polarized regions and conversely build masks for polarization data. We then consider the case of a general [Q, U] covariance matrix and perform a generalization of the estimator that preserves its asymptotic properties. We show that its bias does not depend on the true polarization angle, and provide an analytic estimate of its variance. The estimator value, together with its variance, provide a powerful point estimate of the true polarization amplitude that follows an unbiased Gaussian distribution for an SNR as low as 2. These results can be applied to the much more general case of transforming any normally distributed random variable from Cartesian to polar coordinates.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8195270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stu270","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8195270/08195334.pdf","startPage":"4048","endPage":"4056","doi":"10.1093/mnras/stu270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel estimator of the polarization amplitude from normally distributed Stokes parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A novel estimator of the polarization amplitude from normally distributed Stokes parameters","volume":"439","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8195334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel estimator of the polarization amplitude from normally distributed Stokes parameters","sourcePdf":"stu270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020657S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","isNumber":"8195270","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","articleId":"8195334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8195348,"authors":[{"name":"Xian Wu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xian","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Kun Xu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Peter Hall","affiliation":["University of Bath, Bath, Somerset, GB"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Hall"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"8195348","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5340},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8195348","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Image generation","Generators","Image resolution","Feature extraction","Training","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","image texture","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image synthesis","texture synthesis","image inpainting","image-to-image translation","image editing","generative adversarial networks","GANs","deep networks","GAN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image synthesis","image editing","constrained image synthesis","generative adversarial networks","image-to-image translation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a survey of image synthesis and editing with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

In recent years, a variety of network computing paradigms, such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and dew computing, have been proposed by the industrial and academic communities. Although they employ different terminologies, their basic concept is to extend cloud computing and move the computing infrastructure from remote data centers to edge routers, base stations, and local servers located closer to users, thereby overcoming the bottlenecks experienced by cloud computing and providing better performance and user experience. In this paper, we systematically summarize and analyze the post-cloud computing paradigms that have been proposed in recent years. First, we summarize the main bottlenecks of technology and application that cloud computing encounters. Next, we analyze and summarize several post-cloud computing paradigms, including fog computing, mobile edge computing, and dew computing.

Due to the limitation of the physical design, the resistances of the driver-to-column routing lines in the panel bezel differ across channels. To solve the luminance non-uniformity caused by resistance mismatch, a digitally controlled gm-degeneration technique embedded in the output buffer amplifier is proposed. Each driver channel independently compensates for different routing-line resistances, resulting in a charging rate with excellent uniformity. In addition, the bezel area can be desirably minimized without a zigzag wiring pattern. The prototype 240-channel source-driver IC was fabricated using 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology, and offers a 16.8M-color depth with 13-mW power consumption. With a real OLED display, the measured luminance uniformity under condition of 240-Hz frame rate was improved from o = 1.43% to o = 1.01% by the proposed scheme. The inter-channel output deviation was measured to be \u00b12.7 mV. The video play on 2.4-in OLED panel using a frame rate of 240 Hz was also successfully demonstrated with high display quality.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2017.2776306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/8271882/08197373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2017.2776306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8271882","startPage":"484","endPage":"500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Active-Matrix OLED Driver CMOS IC With Compensation of Non-Uniform Routing-Line Resistances in Ultra-Thin Panel Bezel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8197373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Active-Matrix OLED Driver CMOS IC With Compensation of Non-Uniform Routing-Line Resistances in Ultra-Thin Panel Bezel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8197373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17491332","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8197373/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Korean Government","grantNumber":"NRF-2016R1D1A1B03930510"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003836","fundingName":"IC Design Education Center, South Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Active-Matrix OLED Driver CMOS IC With Compensation of Non-Uniform Routing-Line Resistances in Ultra-Thin Panel Bezel","sourcePdf":"jssc-kim-2776306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066183S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8271882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8271882","articleId":"8197373","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8197378,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Mangia","affiliation":["Advanced Research Center on Electronic Systems, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8293879/8197378/mangi-2766247-small.gif","p":["Mauro Mangia (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information technology from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2005, 2009, and 2013, respectively.

However, the WADC needs communication networks to transmit remote signals; hence, the network-induced delay and packet dropout are inevitably introduced in the communication of wide-area measurement systems (WAMS). In order to effectively compensate delay and packet dropout, in this paper, a new wide-area dynamic damping controller (WADDC) is designed. Firstl the discrete-time model of power system with random delay, packet dropout, and external disturbance is established. Then, the WADDC based on robust H\u221e control is designed and the sufficient condition about stability of the closed-loop system is given. Finally, the controller designed in this paper is tested on the two-area four-machine power system and the 16-machine 68-bus system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness the proposed methods for damping out the low-frequency oscillation and compensating the network-induced delay and packet dropout.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2782792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8387923/08197391.pdf","startPage":"4026","endPage":"4037","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2782792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wide-Area Dynamic Damping Controller Based on Robust <i>H</i>\u221e Control for Wide-Area Power Systems With Random Delay and Packet Dropout","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Wide-Area Dynamic Damping Controller Based on Robust <i>H</i>\u221e Control for Wide-Area Power Systems With Random Delay and Packet Dropout","volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8197391/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857577","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8197391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51607027"},{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technical Supporting Programs of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2016GZ0395, 2017GZ0394 and 2017GZ0395"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016KYQD123"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wide-Area Dynamic Damping Controller Based on Robust <italic>H</italic>\u221e Control for Wide-Area Power Systems With Random Delay and Packet Dropout","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-chen-2782792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095198S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8387923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8387923","articleId":"8197391","onlineDate":"13 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8197432,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Alioto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Massimo Alioto (malioto@ieee.org) is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, where he leads the Green IC group and is the director of the Integrated Circuits and Embedded Systems area.

IoT nodes are the interface between the IoT and the physical world (e.g., sensor nodes). To this aim, we introduce a wide survey of existing devices made publicly available for the further analysis of trends and state of the art. This data-driven approach permits developing quantitative insight into the big picture of the current status of IoT nodes. The analysis shows that an order (ultimately two orders) of magnitude gap needs to be filled in terms of size, lifetime, and cost (energy efficiency) to ultimately make IoT nodes truly ubiquitous and trigger the widely expected exponential growth of the IoT ecosystem. Overall, this article presents a view from the edge of the IoT and a glimpse of its tipping point.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Internet of Things on Its Edge: Trends Toward Its Tipping Point","publicationTitle":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCE.2017.2755218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962380/8197425/08197432.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCE.2017.2755218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8197425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8197432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8197432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"The Internet of Things on Its Edge: Trends Toward Its Tipping Point","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8197432/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17398756","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Internet of Things on Its Edge: Trends Toward Its Tipping Point","sourcePdf":"07mce01-alioto-2755218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083979S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962380","isNumber":"8197425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962380","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8197425","articleId":"8197432","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8197445,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Coughlin","affiliation":["Coughlin Associates"],"bio":{"p":["Tom Coughlin (tom@tomcoughlin.com) is the founder of Coughlin Associates.

A hospital environment can be very stressful, especially for senior citizens and children. With the ever-increasing world population, the conventional patient-doctor appointment has lost its effectiveness. Hence, smart health care becomes very important. Smart health care can be implemented at all levels, starting from temperature monitoring for babies to tracking vital signs in the elderly. The complexity and cost of implementation varies based on the required precision of the individual device, functionalities, and sophistication of the application for which they are used. Smart health care also falls under vertical areas such as very-large-scale integration, embedded system, big data, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. This article discusses the importance, requirements, application of smart health care along with the current industry trends and products.

Today, \"the CDC recommends that opioids should not be the first line or only treatment for patients who present with chronic noncancer pain\" [2]. Additionally, the National Institute on Drug Abuse suggests that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) offers significant advantages and is effective for pain management in many situations where narcotics were previously prescribed. The American College of Physicians has also released new guidelines for the treatment of lower back pain and recommends a nonnarcotic CBT-based approach [3]. These new approaches come at a time when new technologies are being developed as a means to enhance patient engagement and education and to supplement care with information and communication technologies (ICTs) (Figure 1) [4], [5]. For more than 20 years, researchers and clinicians have been applying technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), to conquer specific phobias and anxiety disorders, overcome posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and rehabilitate patients suffering from chronic pain or other debilitating incidents [6]-[9]. The continued trend of migration to mobile devices has increased access and flexibility in patients who seek convenient health-care services. In the future, many patients who routinely use their mobile phone for social networking, commerce, and banking will most likely demand that health-care services be made equally available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8197481/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8197481/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17398753","volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using Virtual Reality to Mobilize Health Care: Mobile Virtual Reality Technology for Attenuation of Anxiety and Pain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Virtual Reality to Mobilize Health Care: Mobile Virtual Reality Technology for Attenuation of Anxiety and Pain","sourcePdf":"07mce01-wiederhold-2715365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088406S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962380","isNumber":"8197425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962380","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8197425","articleId":"8197481","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8197485,"authors":[{"name":"Ayten Ozge Akmandor","affiliation":["Princeton University, New Jersey"],"bio":{"p":["Ayten Ozge Akmandor (akmandor@princeton.edu) earned her B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Turkey, in 2015 and her M.A. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, New Jersey, in 2017.

By using an oversampling ADC and a digital filter, a DCDS system can achieve a better performance than traditional analogue readout techniques at the expense of a more complex system analysis. Several attempts to analyse and optimize a DCDS system have been reported, but most of the work presented in the literature has been experimental. Some approximate analytical tools have been presented for independent parameters of the system, but the overall performance and trade-offs have not been yet modelled. Furthermore, there is disagreement among experimental results that cannot be explained by the analytical tools available. In this work, a theoretical analysis of a generic DCDS readout system is presented, including key aspects such as the signal conditioning stage, the ADC resolution, the sampling frequency and the digital filter implementation. By using a time-domain noise model, the effect of the digital filter is properly modelled as a discrete-time process, thus avoiding the imprecision of continuous-time approximations that have been used so far. As a result, an accurate, closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the readout system is reached. This expression can be easily optimized in order to meet a set of specifications for a given CCD, thus providing a systematic design methodology for an optimal readout system. Simulated results are presented to validate the theory, obtained with both time- and frequency-domain noise generation models for completeness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8198503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stv2410","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8198503/08198562.pdf","startPage":"1443","endPage":"1450","doi":"10.1093/mnras/stv2410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal CCD readout by digital correlated double sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal CCD readout by digital correlated double sampling","volume":"455","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8198562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal CCD readout by digital correlated double sampling","sourcePdf":"stv2410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031033S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","isNumber":"8198503","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","citationCount":"6","articleId":"8198562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8198796,"authors":[{"name":"Tie Qiu","affiliation":["Dalion University of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Tie Qiu (qiutie@ieee.org) [M'11, SM'16] received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from Dalian University of Technology (DUT), China, in 2012.

The failure of nodes brings a significant challenge to the robustness of topologies. The IoT of smart cities is increasingly producing a vast amount different types of data, which includes the node's geographic information, neighbor list, sensing data, and so on. Thus, how to improve the robustness of topology against malicious attacks based on big data of smart cities becomes a critical issue. To tackle this problem, this article proposes an approach to improve the robustness of network topology based on a multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA). First, the geographic information and neighbor list of nodes are extracted from a big data server. Then a novel MPGA with a crossover operator and a mutation operator is proposed to optimize the robustness of topology. Our algorithm keeps the initial degree of each node unchanged such that the optimized topology will not increase the energy cost of adding edges. The extensive experiment results show that our algorithm can significantly improve the robustness of topologies against malicious attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8198796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8198796/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17398680","volume":"55","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Robustness Algorithm for the Internet of Things in Smart Cities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Robustness Algorithm for the Internet of Things in Smart Cities","sourcePdf":"012QIU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053823S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8198782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8198782","articleId":"8198796","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8198797,"authors":[{"name":"Chunsheng Zhu","affiliation":["University of British Columbia"],"bio":{"p":["Chunsheng Zhu (cszhu@ece.ubc.ca) is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada.

Further, the critical issues that affect the success of secure multimedia big data in TASC are identified. With that, motivated by addressing the identified critical issues, this article proposes two types of TASC: TASC-S (TASC with a single trust value threshold), and TASC-M (TASC with multiple trust value thresholds). Finally, with extensive simulation results about TASC-S and TASC-M as well as SC without trust assistance (SCWTA), the following insights into secure multimedia big data in TASC are achieved: the throughput of TASC-S and TASC-M can both be generally higher than that of SCWTA; the throughput of TASC-S can trend with tuned trust value threshold; and the throughput of TASC-M can fluctuate with the same trust value thresholds.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8198782","startPage":"24","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8198782/08198797.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Multimedia Big Data in Trust-Assisted Sensor-Cloud for Smart City","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8198797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8198797/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Secure Multimedia Big Data in Trust-Assisted Sensor-Cloud for Smart City","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17446968","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Multimedia Big Data in Trust-Assisted Sensor-Cloud for Smart City","sourcePdf":"013SHU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072752S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8198782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8198782","articleId":"8198797","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":8198798,"authors":[{"name":"Ying He","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology, Carleton University"],"bio":{"p":["Ying He [S' (heying@sce.carleton.ca) received her B.S. degree from Dalian Ocean University, China, and her M.S. degree from Dalian University of Technology in 2011 and 2015, respectively, both in communication and information systems.

By considering factors like latency, mobility, localization, and scalability, this article proposes a regional cooperative fog-computing-based intelligent vehicular network (CFC-IoV) architecture for dealing with big IoV data in the smart city. Possible services for IoV applications are discussed, including mobility control, multi-source data acquisition, distributed computation and storage, and multi-path data transmission.

Due to the dense deployment of small cells, interference among neighboring cells becomes severe. As a result, effective resource allocation and user association algorithms are essential to minimize inter-cell interference and optimize network performance. However, optimizing network resources in an HUDN is extremely complicated as resource allocation and user association are coupled. Therefore, an HUDN requires low-complexity but effective resource allocation schemes to address these issues. Hypergraph theory has been recognized as a useful mathematical tool to model the complex relations among multiple entities. In this article, we show how the hypergraph models can be used to effectively tackle resource allocation problems in an HUDN.

Heterogeneous UDN is a promising technique for 5G mobile networks. This technique offers high access speeds for video watchers through the dense deployment of small cells. However, the backhaul of a UDN will become a bottleneck with the rapid increase in mobile video traffic. Additionally, the considerable video traffic generated from and to UDNs induces significant stress on the core network of a 5G network. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the distribution of video content for 5G UDNs. Multicasting is considered to be a good communication method for distributing video content. This article examines a video multicast orchestration scheme based on SDN, named HCM, for 5G UDNs. To adapt well to a heterogeneous UDN environment in 5G networks and effectively save spectrum resources, HCM implements wireless multicast functionality based on a common unicast channel. HCM performs concurrent multicasting to clearly reduce the bandwidth consumption of a 5G network, particularly the backhaul, and further controls video traffic passed through the backhaul using a traffic-aware method. During the packet loss recovery of HCM, SDN-based elastic area multicast is used to more effectively retransmit recovered packets. The experimental results indicate that our proposed scheme can distribute video content with high effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8198806/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"55","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17446979","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8198806/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An SDN-Based Video Multicast Orchestration Scheme for 5G Ultra-Dense Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SDN-Based Video Multicast Orchestration Scheme for 5G Ultra-Dense Networks","sourcePdf":"022YANG1_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059937S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8198782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8198782","articleId":"8198806","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8198807,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping An","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Fractional Signals and Systems"],"bio":{"p":["Jianping An received his Ph.D. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 1996.

In this article, we first present a potential network architecture for the UDHN, and then propose a generalized orthogonal/non-orthogonal random access scheme to improve the network efficiency while reducing the signaling overhead.

However, due to the drastic interference between neighboring cells, how to achieve high energy and spectrum efficiency is still an open and challenging problem. This work proposes a systematic solution for content delivery over UDNs by integrating collaboration with intelligence. In particular, we first design a hybrid video coding scheme that is flexible and robust to the dynamic wireless environment. Then an active and proactive video update strategy is designed by intelligently alleviating the impact of the interference. Finally, a collaborative video scheduling scheme is developed to maximize the video quality as well as the energy and spectrum efficiency. Importantly, we summarize three fundamental design guidelines, and believe that they are useful for improving the transmission capacity of UDNs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8198782/08198808.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8198782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8198808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When Collaboration Hugs Intelligence: Content Delivery over Ultra-Dense Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Robustness","Collaboration","Interference","Video coding","Streaming media","Device-to-device communication","Heterogeneous networks","Content management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication scheduling","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content delivery","ultra-dense networks","traffic-intensive video applications","massive video delivery","drastic interference","neighboring cells","spectrum efficiency","hybrid video coding scheme","dynamic wireless environment","active video update strategy","proactive video update strategy","collaborative video scheduling scheme","video quality","fundamental design guidelines","UDN","high energy efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8198808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"When Collaboration Hugs Intelligence: Content Delivery over Ultra-Dense Networks","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8198808/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17446973","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"When Collaboration Hugs Intelligence: Content Delivery over Ultra-Dense Networks","sourcePdf":"024ZHOU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046095S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8198782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"8198782","articleId":"8198808","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8198809,"authors":[{"name":"Junyu Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University"],"bio":{"p":["Junyu Liu [S'15, M'17] received his B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information systems from Xidian University, Shaanxi, China, in 2007 and 2016, respectively.

In particular, the increasing access point/ user density and reduced cell size significantly enhance spatial reuse, thereby improving network capacity. Nevertheless, does network ultra-densification and over-deployment always boost the performance of wireless networks? Since the distance from transmitters to receivers is greatly reduced in dense networks, signal is more likely to be propagated from long- to short-range distance. Without considering short-range propagation features, conventional understanding of network densification becomes doubtful. In this regard, it is imperative to reconsider the pros and cons brought by network densification. In this article, we first discuss the short-range propagation features in densely deployed networks and verify through experimental results the validity of the proposed short-range propagation model. Considering short-range propagation, we further explore the fundamental impact of network densification on network capacity, aided by which a concrete interpretation of ultra-densification is presented from the network capacity perspective. Meanwhile, as short-range propagation makes interference more complicated and difficult to handle, we discuss possible approaches to further enhance network capacity in ultra-dense wireless networks. Moreover, key challenges are presented to suggest future directions.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8198782/08198809.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8198782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Densification in 5G: From the Short-Range Communications Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8198809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Network Densification in 5G: From the Short-Range Communications Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8198809/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17446964","htmlLink":"/document/8198809/","volume":"55","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Densification in 5G: From the Short-Range Communications Perspective","sourcePdf":"025SHENG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084443S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8198782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8198782","articleId":"8198809","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8198811,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyu Xiang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"bio":{"p":["Hongyu Xiang (xianghongyu88@163.com) received his B.E. degree in telecommunication engineering from Fudan University, China, in 2013.

To solve this challenge, enhanced network slicing in F-RANs, called access slicing, is proposed. This article comprehensively presents a novel architecture and related key techniques for access slicing in F-RANs. The proposed hierarchical architecture of access slicing consists of a centralized orchestration layer and a slice instance layer, which makes access slicing adaptively implementable in a convenient way.

In high mobility scenarios, the problem is exacerbated, as achieving the highest rates requires frequent link reconfiguration. One solution is to exploit spatial congruence between signals in different frequency bands and extract mmWave channel parameters with the aid of side information obtained in another band. In this article we propose the concept of out-of-band information aided mmWave communication. We analyze different strategies to leverage information derived from sensors or from other communication systems operating at sub-6 GHz bands to help configure the mmWave communication link. The overhead reductions that can be obtained when exploiting out-of-band information are characterized in a preliminary study. Finally, the challenges associated with using out-of-band signals as a source of side information at mmWave are analyzed in detail.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"140","endPage":"146","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700207","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8198782/08198818.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8198782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Communication with Out-of-Band Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8198818/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Communication with Out-of-Band Information","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17446971","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8198818/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Communication with Out-of-Band Information","sourcePdf":"034HEATH_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048076S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8198782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8198782","articleId":"8198818","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8198822,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenhui Yuan","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Hangzhou Dianzi University, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhenhui Yuan [M'12] received his B.Eng. degree in software engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 2008 and his Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Dublin City University (DCU), Ireland, in 2012.
