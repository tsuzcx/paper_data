One or more low-complexity relay nodes assist the communication between sources and destinations without having to decode the signal. This makes AF relaying transparent to modulation and coding of the source/destination communication protocol. It is therefore a highly flexible technology that also qualifies for application in heterogeneous networks comprising many nodes of different complexity or even standards. Recently, two-way relaying was introduced, which is readily combined with AF relaying. It is a spectrally efficient protocol that allows for bidirectional communication between sources and destinations. In order to investigate the potential of wireless AF relaying, we introduce three distributed network scenarios that differ in the amount of cooperation between nodes. New challenges arise in those networks, and we discuss approaches to overcome them. For the most general case of a completely distributed system, we present coherent relaying solutions that offer a distributed spatial multiplexing gain even for single-antenna nodes. Based on real-world experiments, we validate the feasibility of all schemes in our laboratory.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5183472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5183459/05183472.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5183472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5183459","startPage":"50","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent advances in amplify-and-forward two-hop relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5183472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recent advances in amplify-and-forward two-hop relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5183472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802372","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5183472/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent advances in amplify-and-forward two-hop relaying","sourcePdf":"012BERGERLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061736S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5183459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5183459","articleId":"5183472","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5183473,"authors":[{"name":"Teerawat Issariyakul","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Teerawat Issariyakul [m] (teerawat@ece.ubc.ca) received his B.Eng and M.

The presented architecture combines 2 finite impulse response (FIR) filters to process in-phase and quadrature signals and includes a piecewise linear approximation architecture that performs the required square root operations. The proposed implementation enables flexibility to support different transducers with its ability to load on-the-fly different FIR filter coefficient sets. The complexity and accuracy of the demodulator processor are analyzed with simulated RF data; a normalized residual sum-of-squares cost function is used for comparison with the Matlab Hilbert function. Three implementations are integrated into a hand-held ultrasound system for experimental accuracy and performance evaluation. Real-time images were acquired from a reference phantom, demonstrating the feasibility of using the presented architecture to perform real-time digital quadrature demodulation of ultrasonic signal echoes. Experimental results show that the implementation, using only 2942 slices and 3 dedicated digital multipliers of a low-cost and low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is accurate relative to a comparable software- based system; axial and lateral resolution of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively, were obtained with a 12-mm piezoelectric transducer without postprocessing. Because the processing and sampling rates are the same, high-frequency ultrasound signals can be processed as well. For a 15-frame-per-second display, the hand-held ultrasonic imaging-processing core (FPGA, memory) requires only 45 mW (dynamic) when using a 5-MHz single-element piezoelectric transducer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5183592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802400","htmlLink":"/document/5183592/","pubMedId":"19686981","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Hand-Held Ultrasound Medical-Imaging Device Based on a New Digital Quadrature Demodulation Processor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Hand-Held Ultrasound Medical-Imaging Device Based on a New Digital Quadrature Demodulation Processor","sourcePdf":"t0981654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084536S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5183566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5183566","articleId":"5183592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5183918,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

In this paper we compare different solar energy prediction algorithms that give estimates future available energy over the time.

One reason is the recent growth of decimal computations in commercial, scientific, financial, and Internet-based computer applications. Newly commercialized decimal arithmetic hardware units use radix-10 sequential multipliers that are rather slow for multiplication-intensive applications. Therefore, the future relevant processors are likely to host fast parallel decimal multiplication circuits. The corresponding hardware algorithms are normally composed of three steps: partial product generation (PPG), partial product reduction (PPR), and final carry-propagating addition. The state of the art is represented by two recent full solutions with alternative designs for all the three aforementioned steps. In addition, PPR by itself has been the focus of other recent studies. In this paper, we examine both of the full solutions and the impact of a PPR-only design on the appropriate one. In order to improve the speed of parallel decimal multiplication, we present a new PPG method, fine-tune the PPR method of one of the full solutions and the final addition scheme of the other; thus, assembling a new full solution. Logical Effort analysis and 0.13 mum synthesis show at least 13 percent speed advantage, but at a cost of at most 36 percent additional area consumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Speed of Parallel Decimal Multiplication","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.110","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5271543/05184812.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5271543","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Speed of Parallel Decimal Multiplication","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5184812/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10892971","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Speed of Parallel Decimal Multiplication","sourcePdf":"ttc2009111539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08932S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5271543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5271543","articleId":"5184812","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5184818,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Cucinotta","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Real-Time Systems Laboratory, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5398795/5184818/5184818-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tommaso Cucinotta received the degree in computer engineering from the University of Pisa in 2000, and received the PhD degree in computer engineering from the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna of Pisa in 2004.

The applications are assumed to be periodically triggered and the different tasks communicate by unidirectional buffers. The problem we cope with is how to effectively share the resources so that some specified Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are met. The QoS considered here is tightly related to the end-to-end temporal behavior of the application. To compensate for time-varying resource requirements, we advocate a distributed control approach whereby the scheduling parameters of each task are tuned depending on the temporal behavior of the application measured by appropriate sensors. The use of real-time scheduling strategies enables a mathematically safe control design in which the QoS requirements are translated into control goals, and formal proofs are provided on the ability of the controller to fulfil these goals. We also offer extensive simulations that validate the approach for multimedia applications.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5398795/05184818.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"430","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5398795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS Control for Pipelines of Tasks Using Multiple Resources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"QoS Control for Pipelines of Tasks Using Multiple Resources","htmlLink":"/document/5184818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11147923","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS Control for Pipelines of Tasks Using Multiple Resources","sourcePdf":"ttc2010030416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099112S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5398795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5398795","articleId":"5184818","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5184838,"authors":[{"name":"Yanhua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5550977/5184838/5184838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanhua Chen received the MS degree in computer science and engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, in 2004.

However, data coclustering without any prior knowledge or background information is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Semisupervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SS-NMF) framework for data coclustering. Specifically, our method computes new relational matrices by incorporating user provided constraints through simultaneous distance metric learning and modality selection. Using an iterative algorithm, we then perform trifactorizations of the new matrices to infer the clusters of different data types and their correspondence. Theoretically, we prove the convergence and correctness of SS-NMF coclustering and show the relationship between SS-NMF with other well-known coclustering models. Through extensive experiments conducted on publicly available text, gene expression, and image data sets, we demonstrate the superior performance of SS-NMF for heterogeneous data coclustering.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.169","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5550977/05184838.pdf","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Semisupervised Heterogeneous Data Coclustering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Semisupervised Heterogeneous Data Coclustering","volume":"22","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11476831","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5184838/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Semisupervised Heterogeneous Data Coclustering","sourcePdf":"ttk2010101459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121707S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5550977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5550977","articleId":"5184838","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5184848,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Min Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Min","lastName":"Sun","id":"37277692800"},{"name":"Wei-Chih Ting","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Chih","lastName":"Ting","id":"37594034000"},{"name":"King-Hang Wang","affiliation":["Hong Kong Institute of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"King-Hang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37402604200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5971"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0018"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9209"}],"articleNumber":"5184848","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1270},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Radiofrequency identification","Authentication","Intrusion detection","Databases","Privacy","Cryptographic protocols","Sun","Public key cryptography","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message authentication","protocols","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chien ultralightweight RFID authentication protocol","desynchronization attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","privacy","authentication","RFID","synchronization."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184848","abstract":"Security issues become more and more significant in RFID development.

One of the main weak points of the FC is slow dynamics dominated by a temperature and fuel-delivery system (pumps, valves, and, in some cases, a hydrogen reformer). As a result, fast load demand will cause a high voltage drop in a short time, which is recognized as a fuel-starvation phenomenon. Therefore, to employ an FC in vehicle applications, the electrical system must have at least an auxiliary power source to improve system performance when electrical loads demand high energy in a short time. The possibilities of using a supercapacitor or a battery bank as an auxiliary source with an FC main source are presented in detail. The studies of two hybrid power systems for vehicle applications, i.e., FC/battery and FC/supercapacitor hybrid power sources, are explained. Experimental results with small-scale devices (a polymer electrolyte membrane FC of 500 W, 40 A, and 13 V; a lead-acid battery module of 33 Ah and 48 V; and a supercapacitor module of 292 F, 500 A, and 30 V) in a laboratory authenticate that energy-storage devices can assist the FC to meet the vehicle power demand and help achieve better performance, as well as to substantiate the excellent control schemes during motor-drive cycles.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2028571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/05184856.pdf","startPage":"3892","endPage":"3904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2028571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Study of Fuel-Cell Vehicle Hybridization with Battery or Supercapacitor Storage Device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Study of Fuel-Cell Vehicle Hybridization with Battery or Supercapacitor Storage Device","volume":"58","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903085","htmlLink":"/document/5184856/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Study of Fuel-Cell Vehicle Hybridization with Battery or Supercapacitor Storage Device","sourcePdf":"tvt-thounthong-2028571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114423S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"5184856","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5184857,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh Vinh Do","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Electrom\u00e9canique, Universit\u00e9 de Technologie de Compiegne, Compiegne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/5184857/5184857-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dinh Vinh Do was born in Vietnam in 1982.

Impedance models must be as simple as possible to be implemented on embedded applications but as accurate as possible to represent the main electrochemical phenomena. The parameters of such models can be identified using impedance spectroscopy. However, the electrochemical features change in relation to numerous parameters, such as temperature or aging, which involves updating the model of the battery online. This paper deals with the use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the observation of the parameters of a Li-ion battery lumped model. First, this paper will focus on the electrical model that can be used to represent the main electrochemical phenomena in the battery. Then, mathematical considerations about the EKF are reminded to be applied to the observation of the impedance parameters of the battery. This method has been validated on an urban driving cycle of a hybrid electric vehicle.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impedance Observer for a Li-Ion Battery Using Kalman Filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2028572","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/05184857.pdf","startPage":"3930","endPage":"3937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2028572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Impedance Observer for a Li-Ion Battery Using Kalman Filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5184857/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903083","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance Observer for a Li-Ion Battery Using Kalman Filter","sourcePdf":"tvt-forgez-2028572.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098534S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"5184857","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5184859,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Bok Kong","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Bok","lastName":"Kong","id":"37301293400"},{"name":"Seong-Ook Park","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Ook","lastName":"Park","id":"37280888400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5184859","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maxwell equations","Sampling methods","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Displays","Stability analysis","Numerical simulation","Iterative methods","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simplified SB-ADI scheme","two-dimensional Maxwell equation","simplified sampling biorthogonal method","direction implicit method","sampling biorthogonal time domain algorithm","spatial discretization display","stability analyses","numerical simulation","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating-direction implicit finite-difference time domain (ADI-FDTD)","Maxwell's equations","sampling biorthogonal time domain","stability"]}],"abstract":"This letter represents a simplified sampling biorthogonal alternating-direction implicit (SSB-ADI) method based on the sampling biorthogonal time domain (SBTD) algorithm.

Many techniques have been developed for early failure detection in induction motors. There is the necessity of low-cost instrumentation for online multichannel measurement and analysis of vibration in the frequency domain, and this could be fixed to the machine for continuous monitoring to provide a reliable continuous diagnosis without needing trained staff. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are distinguished by being very fast and highly reconfigurable devices, allowing the development of scalable parallel architectures for multichannel analysis without changing the internal hardware. The novelty of this work is the development of a low-cost FPGA based on a multichannel vibration analyzer; this is capable of providing an automatic diagnosis of the motor state carrying out online continuous monitoring. To test the functionality of the proposed vibration analyzer, three experiments on 746-W (1-hp) induction motors were carried out. Such experiments are intended to detect motor failures such as broken bars, unbalance, and looseness. The obtained results show the overall system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Multiple-Channel Vibration Analyzer for Industrial Applications in Induction Motor Failure Detection","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2021642","startPage":"63","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2021642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5350927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5350927/05184862.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Multiple-Channel Vibration Analyzer for Industrial Applications in Induction Motor Failure Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5184862/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11019133","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Multiple-Channel Vibration Analyzer for Industrial Applications in Induction Motor Failure Detection","sourcePdf":"tim-contrerasmedina-2021642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064432S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5350927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5350927","articleId":"5184862","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5184869,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad A.

This is adopted from the numerical models of a spark channel and consequent shockwave from a lightning discharge, yielding a changing value of the channel radius from the base to the cloud along the RSC. It is demonstrated that the proposed model is more consistent with the nonlinear behavior of a lightning channel inferred from experimental physical observations. The model also satisfies most of the well-known characteristics of RSC, including the temporal and spatial current and charge distributions, some important features observed in radiated electromagnetic fields, and wave propagation speed profiles along the channel when compared with those predicted by the ATIL-F model.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2009.2025655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5208467/05184873.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2009.2025655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Representation of a Lightning Return-Stroke Channel as a Nonlinearly Loaded Thin-Wire Antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184873/","displayDocTitle":"Representation of a Lightning Return-Stroke Channel as a Nonlinearly Loaded Thin-Wire Antenna","volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828846","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5184873/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representation of a Lightning Return-Stroke Channel as a Nonlinearly Loaded Thin-Wire Antenna","sourcePdf":"temc-moini-2025655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108729S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5208467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5208467","articleId":"5184873","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5184874,"authors":[{"name":"Marie Lienou","affiliation":[""],"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Lienou","id":"37400589800"},{"name":"Henri Maitre","affiliation":[""],"firstName":"Henri","lastName":"Maitre","id":"37267797100"},{"name":"Mihai Datcu","affiliation":["Competence Center in the field of Information Extraction, Image Understanding of Earth Observation, CNES-DLR-ENST, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Datcu","id":"37265637100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5184874","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":187,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2179},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Linear discriminant analysis","Data mining","Feature extraction","Indexing","Image analysis","Earth","Layout","Image representation","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","remote sensing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic annotation","satellite images","latent Dirichlet allocation model","spatial information","hierarchical model","random mixture","maximum-likelihood method","panchromatic QuickBird images","large-image annotation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large-image annotation","latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)","spatial information"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we are interested in the annotation of large satellite images, using semantic concepts defined by the user.

The coupled SA (CSA) class is characterized by a set of parallel SA processes coupled by their acceptance probabilities. The coupling is performed by a term in the acceptance probability function, which is a function of the energies of the current states of all SA processes. A particular CSA instance method is distinguished by the form of its coupling term and acceptance probability. In this paper, we present three CSA instance methods and compare them with the uncoupled case, i.e., multistart SA. The primary objective of the coupling in CSA is to create cooperative behavior via information exchange. This aim helps in the decision of whether uphill moves will be accepted. In addition, coupling can provide information that can be used online to steer the overall optimization process toward the global optimum. We present an example where we use the acceptance temperature to control the variance of the acceptance probabilities with a simple control scheme. This approach leads to much better optimization efficiency, because it reduces the sensitivity of the algorithm to initialization parameters while guiding the optimization process to quasioptimal runs. We present the results of extensive experiments and show that the addition of the coupling and the variance control leads to considerable improvements with respect to the uncoupled case and a more recently proposed distributed version of SA.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2020435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5431005/05184877.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2020435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled Simulated Annealing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184877/","displayDocTitle":"Coupled Simulated Annealing","volume":"40","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11171922","pubMedId":"19651558","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5184877/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled Simulated Annealing","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-xavierdesouza-2020435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11452S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5431005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"224","xplore-issue":"5431005","articleId":"5184877","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5184881,"authors":[{"name":"Elisa Vianello","affiliation":["DIEGM, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5208517/5184881/5184881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Elisa Vianello received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering from the Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Udine, Udine, Italy.

In Bell's 1993 paper, the MI was first applied to radar waveform design. Similar to its communications counterpart, the solution comes in a water-filling form. However, the practical meaning of MI in the sensing context remains unclear to date. Recently, Yang and Blum's 2007 paper shows that under the white noise assumption, the optimum water-filling scheme simultaneously maximizes the MI and minimizes the estimation minimum mean square error (MMSE). Such an equivalence, however, does not hold when the target parameter statistics are not perfectly known as shown in Yang and Blum's subsequent work. To further the understanding of the practical meaning of MI and to establish a connection between the MI and commonly adopted MSE measures for sensing, this paper takes a fresh look at the target estimation problem. We consider the general colored noise, incorporate the normalized MSE (NMSE), and develop joint robust designs for both the transmitter (waveforms) and the receiver (estimator) under various target and noise uncertainty models. Our results show that i) the optimum waveform designs resulted from the MI, MMSE and NMSE criteria are all different and ii) compared to MMSE, the NMSE-based designs share more similarities with the MI-based ones, especially when the target and noise statistics are not perfectly known.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05184909.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2028941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2028941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communications-Inspired Sensing: A Case Study on Waveform Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Colored noise","Information theory","Mutual information","Radar","Context","White noise","Mean square error methods","Noise robustness","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","information theory","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","signal processing","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communications-inspired sensing","information theory","mutual information","communications research","radar waveform design","white noise assumption","optimum water-filling scheme","minimum mean square error estimation","target parameter statistics","target estimation problem","general colored noise","normalized MSE","transmitter waveforms","receiver estimator","noise uncertainty models","noise statistics","MIMO sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Colored noise","mean square error","minimax approach","MIMO sensing","mutual information","waveform design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Communications-Inspired Sensing: A Case Study on Waveform Design","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5184909/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054899","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communications-Inspired Sensing: A Case Study on Waveform Design","sourcePdf":"58tsp01-lyang-2028941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116464S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5184909","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5184912,"authors":[{"name":"Le Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbus, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5353758/5184912/5184912-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Le Yang (S'08) was born in Sichuan, China, on June 18, 1979.

This paper extends the previous work to a more practical scenario where the exact position of a calibration emitter is not known. By modeling the calibration position error as additive Gaussian noise, the amount of reduction in localization accuracy due to calibration position error is derived through Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis. In addition, the analysis also affirms the previous studies on Bayesian sensor network localization that it remains possible to improve the localization accuracy even if the calibration position is completely unknown. Next, a performance analysis illustrates that the penalty could be very high if one simply pretends the calibration position is accurate and ignores its error. A closed-form solution is then developed by accounting for the calibration position error and it is proved analytically to reach the CRLB accuracy when the sensor and calibration position errors are small relative to the distance between the calibration emitter and the sensor. Finally, the results are generalized to the case where multiple calibration emitters are available. When deploying multiple calibration emitters, although their positions may not be known exactly, we show that it is possible to completely eliminate the sensor position error and recover the best localization accuracy that is limited by the measurement noise in TDOAs only. All the theoretical developments are corroborated by simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alleviating Sensor Position Error in Source Localization Using Calibration Emitters at Inaccurate Locations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2028947","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05184912.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2028947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Alleviating Sensor Position Error in Source Localization Using Calibration Emitters at Inaccurate Locations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5184912/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020539","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alleviating Sensor Position Error in Source Localization Using Calibration Emitters at Inaccurate Locations","sourcePdf":"58tsp01-dho-2028947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115361S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5184912","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5184915,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Yan","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Kai Yan","id":"37087479600"},{"name":"Jian Jiang","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jian Jiang","id":"37087726586"},{"name":"Ying Guan Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ying Guan Wang","id":"37087566629"},{"name":"Hai Tao Liu","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Hai Tao Liu","id":"37087778174"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5184915","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":675},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Fading","Wireless networks","Decoding","Relays","Closed-form solution","Analytical models","Numerical simulation","Performance analysis","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami channels","probability","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","Nakagami-m fading channels","cooperative diversity","wireless networks","decode-and-forward selection cooperation","optimal maximal ratio combining receiver","closed-form expression","infinite summation expression","simulation","selection combining receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","decode-and-forward","maximal ratio combining","Nakagami-$m$  fading","outage probability","selection cooperation"]}],"abstract":"Selection cooperation has been shown to be an effective way to implement cooperative diversity in wireless networks.

An example for the latter is local-area networks. However, one of the disadvantageous properties of light-emitting diodes is their nonlinear characteristic, which may limit the data transmission performance of the system, especially in the case of multiple subcarrier modulation, which is starting to attract attention in various applications, such as visible-light communications and data transmission over polymer optical fibers. In this paper, the influence of the nonlinear transfer function of the light-emitting diodes on discrete multitone modulation is studied. The transfer function describes the dependence of the emitted optical power on the driving current. Analytical expressions for an idealized link were derived, and these equations allow the estimation of the power of the noise-like, nonlinear crosstalk between the orthogonal subcarriers. The crosstalk components of the quadrature and in-phase subcarrier components were found to be independent and approximately normally distributed. Using these results, the influence of light-emitting-diode nonlinearity on the performance of the system was investigated. The main finding was that systems using a small number of subcarriers and/or high QAM level exhibit a large signal-to-noise-ratio penalty due to the nonlinear crosstalk. The model was applied to systems with white and resonant-cavity light-emitting diodes. It is shown that the nonlinearity may severely limit the performance of the system, particularly in the case of resonant-cavity light-emitting diodes, which exhibit a strong nonlinear behavior.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Nonlinear LED Transfer Function on Discrete Multitone Modulation: Analytical Approach","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2028903","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5235152/05184919.pdf","startPage":"4970","endPage":"4978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2028903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184919/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Nonlinear LED Transfer Function on Discrete Multitone Modulation: Analytical Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/5184919/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10878380","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Nonlinear LED Transfer Function on Discrete Multitone Modulation: Analytical Approach","sourcePdf":"jlt-neokosmidis-2028903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065645S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5235152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5235152","articleId":"5184919","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5184922,"authors":[{"name":"Gerasimos G.

The representation is based on the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">shifting</i>\n action of the group of fractional Hilbert transform (fHT) operators, which extends the notion of arbitrary phase-shifts from sinusoids to finite-energy signals (wavelets in particular). In particular, we characterize the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">shift ability</i>\n of the DT-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\BBC</i>\nWT in terms of the shifting property of the fHTs. At the heart of the representation are certain fundamental invariances of the fHT group, namely that of translation, dilation, and norm, which play a decisive role in establishing the key properties of the transform. It turns out that these fundamental invariances are exclusive to this group. Next, by introducing a generalization of the Bedrosian theorem for the fHT operator, we derive an explicitly understanding of the shifting action of the fHT for the particular family of wavelets obtained through the modulation of lowpass functions (e.g., the Shannon and Gabor wavelet). This, in effect, links the corresponding dual-tree transform with the framework of windowed-Fourier analysis. Finally, we extend these ideas to the multidimensional setting by introducing a directional extension of the fHT, the fractional directional Hilbert transform. In particular, we derive a signal representation involving the superposition of direction-selective wavelets with appropriate phase-shifts, which helps explain the improved shift-invariance of the transform along certain preferential directions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Shiftability of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2028962","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05184923.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2028962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Shiftability of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5184923/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020525","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Shiftability of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transforms","sourcePdf":"58tsp01-kchaudhury-2028962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100517S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5184923","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5184924,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Colonnese","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Scienza e Tecnica dell Informazione e della Comunicazion INFOCOM, Universit\u00e0 La Sapienza di Roma, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5353758/5184924/5184924-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefania Colonnese was born in Rome, Italy.

Many techniques have been proposed to accomplish this. One of these, the S-transform, provides simultaneous time and frequency information similar to the wavelet transform, but uses sinusoidal basis functions to produce frequency and globally referenced phase measurements. It has shown promise in many medical imaging applications but has high computational requirements. This paper presents a general transform that describes Fourier-family transforms, including the Fourier, short-time Fourier, and S- transforms. A discrete, nonredundant formulation of this transform, as well as algorithms for calculating the forward and inverse transforms are also developed. These utilize efficient sampling of the time-frequency plane and have the same computational complexity as the fast Fourier transform. When configured appropriately, this new algorithm samples the continuous S-transform spectrum efficiently and nonredundantly, allowing signals to be transformed in milliseconds rather than days, as compared to the original S-transform algorithm. The new and efficient algorithms make practical many existing signal and image processing techniques, both in biomedical and other applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","volume":"58","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11020513","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5184926/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A General Description of Linear Time-Frequency Transforms and Formulation of a Fast, Invertible Transform That Samples the Continuous S-Transform Spectrum Nonredundantly","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Description of Linear Time-Frequency Transforms and Formulation of a Fast, Invertible Transform That Samples the Continuous S-Transform Spectrum Nonredundantly","sourcePdf":"58tsp01-rfrayne-2028972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072431S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5184926","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5184929,"authors":[{"name":"Sophie Demont-Guignard","affiliation":["Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image (LTSI), Universit\u00e9 de Rennes 1, Rennes, France","U642, Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM), Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5336631/5184929/5184929-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sophie Demont-Guignard received the M.S. and Engineer Diploma degrees from the University of Orleans, Orleans, France, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

Our objective was to explain specific shape features of interictal spikes in the hippocampus (observed in LFPs) in terms of cell- and network-related parameters of neuronal circuits that generate these events. We developed a neural network model based on ldquominimalrdquo but biologically relevant neuron models interconnected through GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses that reproduce the main physiological features of the CA1 subfield. Simulated LFPs were obtained by solving the forward problem (dipole theory) from networks including a large number (~3000) of cells. Insertion of appropriate parameters allowed the model to simulate events that closely resemble actual epileptic spikes. Moreover, the shape of the early fast component (ldquospikerdquo) and the late slow component (ldquonegative waverdquo) was linked to the relative contribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents in pyramidal cells. In addition, the model provides insights about the sensitivity of electrode localization with respect to recorded tissue volume and about the relationship between the LFP and the intracellular activity of principal cells and interneurons represented in the network.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2028015","startPage":"2782","endPage":"2795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2028015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336631","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5336631/05184929.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Intracerebral EEG Recordings of Epileptic Spikes: Insights From a Neural Network Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184929/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Intracerebral EEG Recordings of Epileptic Spikes: Insights From a Neural Network Model","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5184929/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10980015","pubMedId":"19651549","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Intracerebral EEG Recordings of Epileptic Spikes: Insights From a Neural Network Model","sourcePdf":"tbme-wendling-2028015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144143S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5336631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5336631","articleId":"5184929","onlineDate":"31 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5184938,"authors":[{"name":"Jaime Sanchez-Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunications, CICESE, Ensenada, BC, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Sanchez-Garcia","id":"38277337600"},{"name":"Leonel Soriano-Equigua","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunications, CICESE, Ensenada, BC, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Soriano-Equigua","id":"38271131000"},{"name":"Robert W.

These models are a special form of compartmental systems, which involve mass- and energy-balance relations. Aside from their role in chemical engineering applications, mass-action kinetics have numerous analytical properties that are of inherent interest from a dynamical systems perspective. Because of physical considerations, however, mass- action kinetics have special properties, such as nonnegative solutions, that are useful for analyzing their behavior. With this motivation in mind, this article has several objectives. First, a general construction of the kinetic equations based on the reaction laws is provided in a state-space form. Next, the nonnegativity of solutions to the kinetic equations is considered. The realizability problem, which is concerned with the inverse problem of constructing a reaction network having specified essentially nonnegative dynamics, is also considered. In particular, an explicit construction of a reaction network for essentially nonnegative polynomial dynamics involving a scalar state is provided. Next, the reducibility of the kinetic equations is considered as well as the stability of the equilibria of the kinetic equations. Lyapunov methods are applied to the kinetic equations, and semistability is guaranteed through the convergence to a Lyapunov- stable equilibrium that depends on the initial concentrations. Semistability is the appropriate notion of stability for compartmental systems in general, and reaction networks in particular, where the limiting concentration maybe nonzero and may depend on the initial concentrations. Finally, the zero deficiency result for mass-action kinetics in standard matrix terminology is presented and semistability is proven.","doi":"10.1109/MCS.2009.932926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/5182312/05184956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2009.932926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5182312","startPage":"60","endPage":"78","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and analysis of mass-action kinetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and analysis of mass-action kinetics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10802380","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and analysis of mass-action kinetics","sourcePdf":"17-29mcs04-chellaboina.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047893S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","isNumber":"5182312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"121","articleId":"5184956","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5184978,"authors":[{"name":"Werner Rosenkranz","affiliation":["University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Rosenkranz","id":"37277494900"},{"name":"Abdulamir Ali","affiliation":["University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Abdulamir","lastName":"Ali","id":"37306075200"},{"name":"Jochen Leibrich","affiliation":["University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Leibrich","id":"37277518000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4825-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4826-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4827-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"5184978","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"abstract":"The paper addresses OFDM transmission over optical links with low and moderate cost optics which is mandatory in access and in metro applications.

We consider several solutions to overcome this problem and we optimize the transceiver design.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173444/5184967/05184978.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2009.5184978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2009.5184978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5184967","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in optical communications with direct detection for metro networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Costs","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Fiber lasers","Laser modes","Envelope detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metropolitan area networks","OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks","optical receivers","photodetectors","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","optical communications","metro networks","OFDM transmission","optical links","direct detection receivers","photodetectors","magnitude squared envelope detection","dispersive fibre links","transceiver design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical communications","modulation","OFDM","direct detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in optical communications with direct detection for metro networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5184978/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803164","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in optical communications with direct detection for metro networks","confLoc":"Ponta Delgada, Portugal","sourcePdf":"Mo.B2.3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030406S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173444","isNumber":"5184967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173444","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5184967","articleId":"5184978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5184979,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Goebel","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Goebel","id":"37319381900"},{"name":"Stephan Hellerbrand","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Hellerbrand","id":"37319381600"},{"name":"Norman Haufe","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Norman","lastName":"Haufe","id":"37993192100"},{"name":"Norbert Hanik","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Hanik","id":"37264876400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4825-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4826-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4827-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"5184979","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":815},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184979","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Optical distortion","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical mixing","Optical modulation","OFDM modulation","Optical fiber communication","Nonlinear distortion","Nonlinear optics","Optical fiber devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction techniques","coherent optical OFDM transmission","large peak-to-average power ratio","active constellation extension","trellis shaping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["modulation","OFDM","coherent detection","nonlinear fiber effects","PAPR","coding"]}],"abstract":"In coherent optical OFDM systems, the large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) gives rise to signal impairments through the nonlinearity of modulator and fiber.

Multilayer traffic engineering (MLTE) takes advantage of this through online IP logical topology reconfiguration in addition to the more traditional rerouting. Although MLTE typically optimizes towards resource usage, bandwidth throughput and QoS performance, energy efficiency has become an equally important objective recently. In this paper, we examine two types of power reduction techniques and their interaction with the MLTE scheme: simple down-scaling of equipment power requirements, or more radical equipment architecture innovations which concentrate on reducing idle energy consumption. We show that both techniques require a different MLTE approach, and compare total power requirements for both scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2009.5184981","publicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173444/5184967/05184981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2009.5184981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5184967","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power reduction techniques in multilayer traffic engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5184981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power reduction techniques in multilayer traffic engineering","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5184981/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803378","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5184981/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power reduction techniques in multilayer traffic engineering","confLoc":"Ponta Delgada, Portugal","sourcePdf":"Mo.B3.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047325S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173444","isNumber":"5184967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173444","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5184967","articleId":"5184981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5185002,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In order to increase the frequency operation range limited to hundreds of MHz due to the fibre dispersion effects over the optical broadband source, a Mach-Zehnder Interferometric structure is introduced to extend the operative frequency range up to 20 GHz. In this context, the quality of service of different digital signals such as BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM is experimentally evaluated.

Toward this goal, we propose in this paper rate-adaptive polarization multiplexed coded multilevel modulation schemes based on non-binary quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and coherent detection. The proposed scheme can support data rates at 100 Gb/s and beyond while offering comparably better forward error correction performance with less computational complexity than bit-interleaved coded modulation schemes. The ability to adapt changing channel conditions is achieved by exploiting the inherent structure of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2009.5185083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5184967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2009.5185083","publicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173444/5184967/05185083.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-adaptive non-binary-LDPC-coded polarization-multiplexed multilevel modulation with coherent detection for optically-routed networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Rate-adaptive non-binary-LDPC-coded polarization-multiplexed multilevel modulation with coherent detection for optically-routed networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5185083/","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803480","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5185083/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-adaptive non-binary-LDPC-coded polarization-multiplexed multilevel modulation with coherent detection for optically-routed networks","confLoc":"Ponta Delgada, Portugal","sourcePdf":"Tu.B2.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045121S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173444","isNumber":"5184967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173444","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5184967","articleId":"5185083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5185084,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson M.

The design is based on SARDANA (Scalable Advanced Ring -based Passive Dense Access Network Architecture) and was generated as an alternative solution, with its novelty laying on the use of L-band in line remote amplification. The simulation of an extended access WDM/TDM PON formed in a double fibre ring with single fiber trees was created. The network's operation has been tested for several conditions of usage (i.e. maximum number of users, transmission power and pump power) and an optimization of the design has been performed. The target was to achieve, with given transmission and pump power, the reach of more then 1000 users with input power high enough to permit the use of an RSOA at the ONU. The use of L-band signals and special doped fiber has permitted the effective use of RSOAs in the total of the end users.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["L-band","Wavelength division multiplexing","Passive optical networks","Optical network units","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical pumping","Time division multiplexing","Optical fiber testing","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L-band in-line remote amplification","extended WDM/PON ring architecture","scalable advanced ring-based passive dense access network architecture","double fibre ring","single fiber trees"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["in-line amplification","L- band","remote node","pump power","symmetric design","frequency allocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2009.5185151","publicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173444/5184967/05185151.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5184967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2009.5185151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"L-band in-line remote amplification for an extended WDM/PON ring architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5185151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"L-band in-line remote amplification for an extended WDM/PON ring architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5185151/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5185151/","accessionNumber":"10803189","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"L-band in-line remote amplification for an extended WDM/PON ring architecture","confLoc":"Ponta Delgada, Portugal","sourcePdf":"Tu.D5.5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036911S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173444","isNumber":"5184967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173444","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5184967","articleId":"5185151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5185211,"authors":[{"name":"Makoto Murakami","affiliation":["Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Murakami","id":"37347191300"},{"name":"Kazuhiro Oda","affiliation":["Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Oda","id":"37320349900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4825-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4826-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4827-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"5185211","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5185211","abstract":"We describe the comparative analysis of the power consumption between optical cross-connect equipment based on electrical and photonic matrix switching, which will be used for future large capacity optical networks.

The system used 7-chip transversal filters giving a potential for 7 users, where each user had a data rate of 1.25 Gb/s. In this paper, we show two techniques to scale up the electronically processed CDMA (ECDMA) system, namely by increasing the number of chips in the code and doubling the capacity using I and Q modulation of two in-quadrature channels. For increasing the number of chips, we demonstrate an electronically processed Walsh Code with 16 chips at 18 Gchip/s. An auto-cross correlation ratio of 18.1 dB is achieved between two orthogonal codes after transmission over 10 km of SMF. In addition, I-Q modulation of two electronic CDMA channels using the same electronic transversal filters is demonstrated. Here, two in-quadrature channels with chip rates of 18 Gchip/s show the potential of current technology for future 40 Gb/s throughput ECDMA PONs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalability techniques

The control strategy consists of driving the bridge with the largest DC voltage to generate a three-level pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) voltage waveform. This PWM is ruled by two manipulated variables: the phase shift between the primary and secondary transformer voltages and the modulation index. These variables are calculated using an algorithm that is deduced on the basis of particular calculation and analysis of converter losses, which are also presented in this paper. An experimental prototype was implemented to validate the theoretical analysis and feasibility of the proposal.

They would tell you their system had the latest microprocessor when it actually had a cheaper, slower version running faster than the chip's rating permitted. So the shiny, new 500-megahertz system you thought you were buying might contain only an overclocked 300-MHz CPU. But the computer worked fine; indeed, it might have operated perfectly for years, with you none the wiser. And you perhaps replaced it only because a good buy on a 1-gigahertz machine eventually came along. How did that poor 300-MHz processor cope with such abuse? The short answer is that the manufacturer had set the clock speed low to ensure that its products would function without fault despite the inevitable variations among chips and among their different operating environments. Shady overclockers took advantage of that conservatism, inviting unpredictable failures when they eliminated the chipmaker's prudent safety margins. Lately, overclocking has gone mainstream. You can, for example, find competitions on the Web in which hardware hackers vie for top honors in this domain.

One of our experiments on a real testbed shows that leveraging such features can improve the overall utility of the data center by 47% or even higher. Motivated by these, we present a novel suite of techniques for placement and power consolidation of VMs in data centers taking advantage of the min-max and shares features inherent in virtualization technologies. Our techniques provide a smooth mechanism for power-performance tradeoffs in modern data centers running heterogeneous applications, wherein the amount of resources allocated to a VM can be adjusted based on available resources, power costs, and application utilities. We evaluate our techniques on a range of large synthetic data center setups and a small real data center testbed comprising of VMware ESX servers. Our experiments confirm the end-to-end validity of our approach and demonstrate that our final candidate algorithm, PowerExpandMinMax, consistently yields the best overall utility across a broad spectrum of inputs - varying VM sizes and utilities, varying server capacities and varying power costs - thus providing a practical solution for administrators.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2009.5188832","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174535/5188779/05188832.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2009.5188832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188779","startPage":"327","endPage":"334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shares and utilities based power consolidation in virtualized server environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shares and utilities based power consolidation in virtualized server environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5188832/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804285","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5188832/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shares and utilities based power consolidation in virtualized server environments","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"rp053-48131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086144S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174535","isNumber":"5188779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174535","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5188779","articleId":"5188832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5188874,"authors":[{"name":"Gulfem Isiklar Alptekin","affiliation":["Boazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gulfem Isiklar","lastName":"Alptekin","id":"37063832800"},{"name":"Ayse Basar Bener","affiliation":["Boazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ayse Basar","lastName":"Bener","id":"37064069100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3487-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5188874","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio spectrum management","Cognitive radio","Frequency","TV","Regulators","FCC","Hardware","Pricing","Quality of service","Radio communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","radio access networks","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum management mechanism","cognitive radio networks","dynamic spectrum access","game theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum management","spectrum pricing","cognitive radio networks"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient spectrum management mechanism for cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/INM.2009.5188874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188779","endPage":"660","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174535/5188779/05188874.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2009.5188874","startPage":"653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188874","abstract":"The traditional static spectrum access approach, which assigns a fixed portion of the spectrum to a specific license holder for exclusive use, is unable to manage the spectrum efficiently any longer. In an effort to improve the efficiency of its usage, alternative spectrum allocation scenarios are being proposed. One of these technologies is the Dynamic Spectrum Access which enables wireless users to share a wide range of available spectrum in an opportunistic manner. In this paper, we study an architecture for a competitive spectrum exchange marketplace, a theoretic base, and the empirical work for spectrum price formation. The competitive spectrum exchange marketplace architecture considers short term sub-lease of unutilized spectrum bands to different service providers. Our proposed pricing model applies game theory as its mathematical base. The Nash equilibrium point tells the spectrum holders the ideal price values where profit is maximized at the highest level of customer satisfaction. Our empirical results prove that the service providers' demand depends on the price and QoS of that band as well as the price and QoS offering of its competitors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5188874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10804327","htmlLink":"/document/5188874/","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An efficient spectrum management mechanism for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient spectrum management mechanism for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"rp095-48770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060675S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174535","isNumber":"5188779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174535","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5188779","articleId":"5188874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5188884,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Gonzalez Prieto","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering KTH, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Gonzalez Prieto","id":"37271293100"},{"name":"Rolf Stadler","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering KTH, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Stadler","id":"37266859500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3487-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5188884","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Large-scale systems","Protocols","Condition monitoring","Adaptive systems","Environmental management","Decision making","Counting circuits","Measurement","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale systems","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive real-time monitoring","large-scale networked system","adaptive management system","network management","global metrics","distributed monitoring process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive management","real-time monitoring","large-scale distributed systems"]}],"abstract":"The focus of this thesis is continuous real-time monitoring, which is essential for the realization of adaptive management systems in large-scale dynamic environments. Real-time monitoring provides the necessary input to the decision-making process of network management. We have developed, implemented, and evaluated a design for real-time continuous monitoring of global metrics with performance objectives, such as monitoring overhead and estimation accuracy. Global metrics describe the state of the system as a whole, in contrast to local metrics, such as device counters or local protocol states, which capture the state of a local entity. Global metrics are computed from local metrics using aggregation functions, such as SUM, AVERAGE and MAX. A key part in the design is a model for the distributed monitoring process that relates performance metrics to parameters that tune the behavior of a monitoring protocol. The model has been instrumental in designing a monitoring protocol that is controllable and achieves given performance objectives. Our design has proved to be effective in meeting performance objectives, efficient, adaptive to changes in the networking conditions, controllable along different performance dimensions, and scalable. We have implemented a prototype on a testbed of commercial routers, which proves the feasibility of the design, and, more generally, the feasibility of effective and efficient real-time monitoring in large network environments.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2009.5188884","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174535/5188779/05188884.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2009.5188884","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management","startPage":"790","endPage":"795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive real-time monitoring for large-scale networked systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive real-time monitoring for large-scale networked systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5188884/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5188884/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804337","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive real-time monitoring for large-scale networked systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"rp105-51141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053113S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174535","isNumber":"5188779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174535","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5188779","articleId":"5188884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5188907,"authors":[{"name":"Yasunori Futatsugi","affiliation":["System Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunori","lastName":"Futatsugi","id":"37992847900"},{"name":"Shousei Yoshida","affiliation":["Intellectual Asset Development Promotion Division, NEC Corporation Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Shousei","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37270906000"},{"name":"Masayuki Ariyoshi","affiliation":["System Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Ariyoshi","id":"37344261600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5188907","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","multiuser channels","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial spectrum transmission method","dynamic spectrum access","low priority user condition","radio environment","PSK"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single carrier","partial spectrum","sequence estimation","iterative equalization","interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a partial spectrum transmission (PST) method for dynamic spectrum access (DSA).

The CCP enables a digital cognitive radio to detect the presence of legacy analog or digital radios, and to facilitate channel-change procedures to use an alternate, vacant block of spectrum. This allows primary and secondary users to co-exist in the same band with minimal interference and reductions in quality of service (QoS). The CCP also provides an advantage to other systems' frequency management schemes in terms of simplicity of design and execution. We evaluate the CCP's performance through OMNeT++ simulations and experiments in a five node laboratory network testbed. We present our results in terms of the CCP's ability to detect and avoid the primary user and record its improvement to user QoS.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05188908.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The smart radio channel change protocol a primary user avoidance technique for dynamic spectrum sharing cognitive radios to facilitate co-existence in wireless communication networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5188908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5188908/","displayDocTitle":"The smart radio channel change protocol a primary user avoidance technique for dynamic spectrum sharing cognitive radios to facilitate co-existence in wireless communication networks","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804086","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The smart radio channel change protocol a primary user avoidance technique for dynamic spectrum sharing cognitive radios to facilitate co-existence in wireless communication networks","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-41716-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041873S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5188908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEESent to SPI 7-22-09Camee back 7-30-09","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5188923,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoyi Xu","affiliation":["Nokia (China) Investment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shaoyi Xu","id":"37395024500"},{"name":"Yanlei Shang","affiliation":["Nokia (China) Investment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yanlei Shang","id":"37558612300"},{"name":"Haiming Wang","affiliation":["Nokia (China) Investment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Haiming Wang","id":"37292552300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5188923","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Detectors","Matched filters","Degradation","Radio transmitters","Emulation","Testing","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","security aspects","untrusted secondary users","data fusion","eigenvalue-based detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio (CR)","primary user (PU)","secondary user (SU)","untrusted user","maximum eigenvalue (MEV)"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sensing is an essential mechanism for a cognitive radio system. However, the security aspects of spectrum sensing receive little attention so far. In this paper, we identify two kinds of untrusted secondary users which are called dasiaAlways Yespsila users and dasiaAlways Nopsila users. These untrusted secondary users can degrade detection performance greatly, especially when conventional data fusion rules are applied. To counter these threats, for the correlated primary signals, an eigenvalues based detection scheme with double thresholds and revised data fusion rules is proposed. Maximum eigenvalues are proved to be very effective to detect the correlated primary signals and to find the untrusted users. By using the revised data fusion rules, simulation shows that our method has a better detection performance than the conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188923","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05188923.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188923","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eigenvalues based spectrum sensing against untrusted users in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Eigenvalues based spectrum sensing against untrusted users in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5188923/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5188923/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804087","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenvalues based spectrum sensing against untrusted users in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-41959-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09052S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5188923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5188938,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhua Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yuhua Xu","id":"37596320600"},{"name":"Jinlong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jinlong Wang","id":"37280540300"},{"name":"Qihui Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Qihui Wu","id":"37290356800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5188938","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Queueing analysis","Throughput","Data communication","Protection","Programmable logic arrays","Computer simulation","Markov processes","Interference constraints","Wireless communication","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["queueing theory","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","time-domain analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","interference-throughput tradeoff","discrete-time queue","bursty preemption","time domain","spectrum sensing","data transmission","sense-then-transmit strategy","primary user","secondary user","temporal channel unavailability","PITR","primary interfered time ratio","wireless communication system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","discrete-time queuing","preemption priority"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188938","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188938","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","abstract":"This article considers the issue of dynamic spectrum access in time domain, in which the secondary user seeks spectrum vacancy between bursty transmissions of the primary user to communicate. Since spectrum sensing and data transmission can not be done simultaneously in the same band, the secondary user should employ the sense-then-transmit strategy to detect the presence of primary user before accessing the licensed band. We model the behavior of the secondary user as a discrete-time queuing subjected to bursty preemption, which is an abstraction of temporal channel unavailability due to the random presence of the primary user. We formulate an interference-throughput tradeoff problem under the discrete-time queuing framework, and find the optimal slot duration to maximize the throughput of the secondary user, yet to ensure the primary interfered time ratio (PITR) is less than a tolerable threshold.

Reliable detection of primary user (PR) signals and spectrum sensing are the most important challenges which meet the implementation of the CR. In CR's communications, the PR user must be protected from the interference from the CR users. This can be achieved only by using an optimal spectrum sensing. In this paper we apply the multitaper method with singular value decomposition (MTMSVD) in the estimation of the power spectrum density and the decision about the presence or the absence of PR transmission. Our system model consists of a licensed PR user transmits QPSK-OFDM signal in a specific band, and a number of CR's sensors that detect the PR user's signal and this information is used by a CR base station to facilitate the CR user's communications through AWGN channel. We will compare the MTM-SVD technique with the conventional method of power spectrum density estimation (periodogram). Our results show that the MTM-SVD has a better performance in low SNR compared with the energy detection method. Furthermore, MTM-SVD is a powerful method that combines the mutual information using a number of sensors and different tapers. The decision process has a large threshold margin, which increases the probability of the correct decision. Increasing the sensors improves the performance of the spectral sensing in a low SNR environment.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188952","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05188952.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188952","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of cognitive radio spectrum sensing using multitaper-singular value decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of cognitive radio spectrum sensing using multitaper-singular value decomposition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5188952/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5188952/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804092","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of cognitive radio spectrum sensing using multitaper-singular value decomposition","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-46906-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04208S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5188952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEESent to SPI 7-22-09Camee back 7-30-09","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5188966,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37423456300"},{"name":"Stephen Hailes","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Hailes","id":"37269406400"},{"name":"Vinay Kolar","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Kolar","id":"38318756100"},{"name":"Marina Petrova","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Petrova","id":"37266543100"},{"name":"Petri Mahonen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Mahonen","id":"37266541100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5188966","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Resource management","Computer architecture","Wireless networks","Wireless application protocol","Application software","Hardware","Radio control","Radio spectrum management","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","object-oriented programming","protocols","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["component-based architecture","cognitive radio resource management","wireless network","protocol","heterogeneous systems","policy engine","management software","generic interfaces"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188966","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188966","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","abstract":"Cognitive radio networks are envisioned to solve the problem of spectral scarcity in wireless networks; through providing highly configurable radios and protocol stacks to support the application of a variety of efficient and possibly cross-layered solutions.

Instead of covering the various networks by a single CPC, the novel idea consists in deploying the CPC transmission in a distributed way within each of the individual Smart Femto Cell (SFC) controlled Composite Networks (CNs), an example of which can be a heterogeneous home or business deployment including the collection of a Femto- Cell Base Station (FC-BS), a Wireless LAN (WLAN) Access Point (AP), a ZigBee network controller, a Bluetooth network controller, etc. A typical implementation of this concept leads to an integration of the DCPC transmitter into a SFC which consists of the FC-BS for provision of cellular access and the SFC-C for network management and DCPC provision. In this case, the SFC owner is able to manage the attached composite network by providing suitable context and policy information within the DCPC. The paper furthermore introduces intra-network and inter-network interference scenarios and explains how the DCPC concept allows the introduction of corresponding interference management mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188979","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05188979.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart femto-cell controller based distributed cognitive pilot channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5188979/","displayDocTitle":"Smart femto-cell controller based distributed cognitive pilot channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804095","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5188979/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart femto-cell controller based distributed cognitive pilot channel","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-53502-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078547S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5188979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5188993,"authors":[{"name":"Vesa Turunen","affiliation":["Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Vesa","lastName":"Turunen","id":"37391750900"},{"name":"Marko Kosunen","affiliation":["Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Kosunen","id":"37270508500"},{"name":"Anu Huttunen","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Anu","lastName":"Huttunen","id":"37304162300"},{"name":"Sami Kallioinen","affiliation":["Otaniemi Lablet, Nokia Research Center, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Kallioinen","id":"37695584300"},{"name":"Petri Ikonen","affiliation":["Otaniemi Lablet, Nokia Research Center, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Ikonen","id":"37994307600"},{"name":"Aarno Parssinen","affiliation":["Otaniemi Lablet, Nokia Research Center, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Aarno","lastName":"Parssinen","id":"37266079200"},{"name":"Jussi Ryynanen","affiliation":["Department of Micro-and Nanosciences, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Ryynanen","id":"37271432900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5188993","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Detectors","Cognitive radio","Field programmable gate arrays","Wireless LAN","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Wireless sensor networks","Digital TV","Radio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","detector circuits","field programmable gate arrays","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclostationary feature detector","cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","radio spectrum","FPGA","cyclic spectrum","802.11g WLAN signal","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sensing is needed in cognitive radios to provide information about the surrounding radio spectrum.

However, cognitive radios may not be able to secure a clear spectrum band, i.e., white hole, in certain environments. Underlay spectrum sharing provides a way to cope with such a spectrum sharing problem in a bustling spectrum band; cognitive radios share the spectrum band with the spectrum licensees, i.e., primary users, by adjusting signal transmit power so as not to severely deteriorate the performance of the primary users. In this paper, we propose an underlay spectrum sharing policy for cognitive radios. Primary users are assumed to form a cellular network, and a point-to-point link of cognitive radio leverages uplink spectrum resource of the primary network. We formulate the transmit power constraints of the cognitive radio transmitter and propose a practical uplink band sharing framework. We also demonstrate that such an uplink band sharing can enhance the throughput performance of point- to-point link, while the interference to the primary users can be regulated under the allowed level decided by the primary users.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188994","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05188994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5188994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic band sharing for point-to-point link connection of cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5188994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic band sharing for point-to-point link connection of cognitive radios","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5188994/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804098","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5188994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic band sharing for point-to-point link connection of cognitive radios","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-57250-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058612S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5188994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEESent to SPI 7-22-09Camee back 7-30-09","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5189007,"authors":[{"name":"Si Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Si","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403393000"},{"name":"Alexander M.

Using the fact that a cognitive radio is capable of sensing the prevailing environmental conditions and automatically adapting its operating parameters in order to enhance system (and potentially network) performance, the proposed approaches will optimize individual wireless devices using partial operating parameter and environmental information from adjacent devices within the network. Assuming stationary wireless nodes, with all wireless links employing non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NCOFDM) in order to enable dynamic spectrum access (DSA), the proposed approach will attempt to simultaneously minimize the bit error rate, minimize out-of-band (OOB) interference, and maximize overall throughput using a multi-objective fitness function.

However, the eigenvalue-based detection schemes presented so far rely on asymptotic assumptions that are not suitable for many realistic scenarios, thus determining a substantial degradation of detection performance. In this paper, starting from the analytical distribution of the ordered eigenvalues of finite-dimension Wishart matrices, we derive an exact expression for the decision threshold as a function of the probability of false alarm. Since it is not based on asymptotical assumptions, the novel decision rule is valid for any, even small, number of samples and cooperating receivers. In addition to the exact expression, an alternative (approximated) formula is then derived to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed detector, both with the exact and the approximated formula, outperforms the other existing eigenvalue-based techniques, especially when the receiver operates under non-asymptotical conditions.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189008","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189008.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189008","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact non-asymptotic threshold for eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Exact non-asymptotic threshold for eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189008/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189008/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804100","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact non-asymptotic threshold for eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-58938-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080878S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5189021,"authors":[{"name":"Lionel Biard","affiliation":["CEA LETI, MINA TEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Biard","id":"37294276100"},{"name":"Dominique Noguet","affiliation":["CEA LETI, MINA TEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Noguet","id":"37269216000"},{"name":"Tassilo Gernandt","affiliation":["IMST, Kamp-Linfort, Germany"],"firstName":"Tassilo","lastName":"Gernandt","id":"37992296800"},{"name":"Paulo Marques","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Marques","id":"37333293700"},{"name":"Atilio Gameiro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Atilio","lastName":"Gameiro","id":"37270506000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189021","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Cognitive radio","Radiofrequency identification","Frequency domain analysis","Timing","Decision making","Collaboration","Streaming media","OFDM","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware demonstrator","cognitive radio system","temporal opportunities","spectrum resources","frequency domain","temporal opportunities","opportunistic radio systems","IEEE 802.11 primary system running","video streaming application","OFDM","W-CDMA PHY","cyclostationarity sensing algorithm","complexity decision-making algorithm","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","opportunistic radio","hardware implementation","collaborative sensing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware demonstrator of a cognitive Radio system using temporal opportunities","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189021.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189021","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189021","abstract":"Opportunistic radio (OR) systems usually identify and exploit unused spectrum resources in the frequency domain. Targeting opportunities in the time domain of course yields more stringent timing requirements for the opportunistic system, but enables a more optimized resource usage when spectrum opportunities are limited, like for unlicensed bands. This paper describes a hardware demonstrator of such an OR system detecting and using temporal opportunities, and particularly focuses on the key modules required to achieve the opportunistic functionality. To this end, it presents an exclusive implementation of a cyclostationarity sensing algorithm, and proposes a low complexity decision-making algorithm, which performs real-time regulation of the OR communications. Finally, it includes collaborative sensing features to address efficiently the hiddennode scenario. The demonstrator operates in the 2.4 GHz band, and has been validated by sharing the spectrum resource with a standard IEEE 802.11g primary system (PS) running a video streaming application, without perceptible impact of the OR system. It should finally be emphasized that the concepts and techniques undertaken can easily be transposed to any packet based transmission over OFDM or W-CDMA PHY.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10804101","htmlLink":"/document/5189021/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A hardware demonstrator of a cognitive Radio system using temporal opportunities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware demonstrator of a cognitive Radio system using temporal opportunities","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-59988-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070949S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEESent to SPI 7-22-09Camee back 7-30-09","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5189022,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Harada","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Harada","id":"37276707400"},{"name":"Homare Murakami","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Homare","lastName":"Murakami","id":"37270645100"},{"name":"Kentaro Ishizu","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kentaro","lastName":"Ishizu","id":"37283847400"},{"name":"Stanislav Filin","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Stanislav","lastName":"Filin","id":"37285275800"},{"name":"Goh Miyamoto","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Goh","lastName":"Miyamoto","id":"37391775600"},{"name":"Ha Nguyen Tran","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"lastName":"Ha Nguyen Tran","id":"37394762100"},{"name":"Yohannes D.

We derive a simple, accurate approximation to alpha which gives considerable insight into system capacity. We also investigate the effects of system parameters and propagation environment on alpha and the CR capacity. In all cases, the use of the approximation is shown to be extremely accurate. Finally, we derive the probability that the ldquolow interference regimerdquo holds and demonstrate that this is the dominant case, especially in practical CR deployment scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10804103","htmlLink":"/document/5189035/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the statistics of cognitive radio capacity in shadowing and fast fading environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the statistics of cognitive radio capacity in shadowing and fast fading environments","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-63824-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054436S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189036,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Bixio","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Bixio","id":"37283318500"},{"name":"Marina Ottonello","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Ottonello","id":"37397465000"},{"name":"Hany Sallam","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Sallam","id":"37297618700"},{"name":"Mirco Raffetto","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Mirco","lastName":"Raffetto","id":"37298146000"},{"name":"Carlo S.

In order to overcome such a problem, by exploiting efficiently the spectral resources, dynamic spectrum access has been proposed. In this context, cognitive radio represents one of the most promising technologies which allows an efficient use of the radio resource by collecting, processing and exploiting information regarding the spectrum utilization in a monitored area. To this end, in this paper the problem of classifying similar signals characterized by different spectral redundancies is addressed by using a neural network ensemble.

The analysis is focused on the case of many users, and large spreading sequences such that their ratio, which is the system load, is kept fixed. Spectral efficiency of practical linear detectors such as match-filter and decorrelator employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver is derived. This is used to extend the notion of strongest users detectors for SIC receivers. The strongest users detectors system design relies on an outage approach where each user transmits in a single layer (fixed rate). This constraint is relaxed here, and the concept is combined with a broadcast approach, providing higher achievable rates.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189049","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive interference cancelation and strongest users detectors for randomly spread DS-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Successive interference cancelation and strongest users detectors for randomly spread DS-CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189049/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804105","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5189049/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive interference cancelation and strongest users detectors for randomly spread DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-65455-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096301S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5189063,"authors":[{"name":"Mounir Ghogho","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Ghogho","id":"37284467100"},{"name":"Marco Cardenas-Juarez","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Cardenas-Juarez","id":"38270918300"},{"name":"Ananthram Swami","affiliation":["Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ananthram","lastName":"Swami","id":"37273357300"},{"name":"Tim Whitworth","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Whitworth","id":"37313204200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189063","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Detectors","Probability","Signal to noise ratio","Radio transmitters","Binary phase shift keying","Electromagnetic measurements","Frequency","Laboratories","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","cognitive radio","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locally optimum detection","spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","linear modulation","additive white Gaussian noise","BPSK modulation"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sensing is a key feature in cognitive radio networks. We propose a locally optimum (LO) detector, which is known to be optimum at low SNR. This is desirable in cognitive radio since the primary user's signal may exhibit a very low power at the cognitive user's transmitter. We focus here on linear modulation in the presence of an unknown phase shift and additive white Gaussian noise. In the case of BPSK modulation, the sufficient statistic of the LO detector is shown to be the sum of the absolute second-order moment (i.e., energy) and second-order moment (pseudo-energy) estimates. For higher size constellation, it is proven that the energy detector is locally optimum. The paper also addresses the issue of noise power uncertainty, to which the energy detector is very sensitive. Although the proposed LO detector is shown to be less sensitive than the energy detector, its performance does deteriorate at high noise power mismatch values. To overcome this problem, we also propose a detector whose probability of false alarm is independent of the noise power. Simulation results show that the proposed detectors in the case of BPSK significantly outperform the energy detector. Further, the complexity of the proposed detectors is only slightly higher than that of the energy detector.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189063","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189063.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189063","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally optimum detection for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Locally optimum detection for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189063/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189063/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804107","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally optimum detection for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-66760-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070137S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5189077,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuel B.

Numerous methods have been devised to resolve this problem. Most of these selection schemes were applied to specific system models and for frequency flat systems. In broadband systems like WiMAX (IEEE 802.16-2004), the overall channel under consideration is typically frequency selective, and flat only over the subcarrier bandwidths. In this work, receive antenna subset selection schemes are applied to a WiMAX compliant MIMO-OFDM transmission system. Simulation results in terms of average throughput and BER on an adaptive modulation and coding link are shown. Very unexpectedly we find that the optimal selection for maximum throughput, does not give the best results in terms of BER performance. We thus conclude that minimum BER is not the right choice for antenna selection. We also find through our simulations that the simple, low complex norm based selection algorithm, provides good results, close to optimal selection in frequency selective channels.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189078","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of antenna selection algorithms in WiMAX with link adaptation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189078/","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of antenna selection algorithms in WiMAX with link adaptation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804110","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189078/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of antenna selection algorithms in WiMAX with link adaptation","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-68017-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120663S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5189092,"authors":[{"name":"Liaoyuan Zeng","affiliation":["Wireless Access Research Center, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Liaoyuan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37306352700"},{"name":"Sean McGrath","affiliation":["Wireless Access Research Center, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"McGrath","id":"37268366100"},{"name":"Eduardo Cano","affiliation":["Institute of the Protection and Security of the Citizen, Joint Research Centre European Commission, Ispra Varese, Italy"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Cano","id":"37272105900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189092","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Ultra wideband technology","Cognitive radio","Bandwidth","Chromium","Fading","Bit error rate","FCC","Interference","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","fading channels","optimisation","Poisson distribution","quadrature amplitude modulation","spectral analysis","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power","bit allocation scheme","UWB transmit power spectral density mask","ultra wideband cognitive radio system","rate maximization algorithm","M-QAM modulation","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","optimization","false alarm probability","bit error rate","UWB fading channel","Poisson distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189092","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189092","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","abstract":"An optimal power and bit allocation scheme for rate maximization in the ultra wideband (UWB) cognitive radio system is presented in this paper.

In this paper, a significant cycle frequency based feature detection algorithm has been proposed, in which only cycle frequency with significant cyclic cumulant is considered for a certain modulation mode.

In absence of the a priori probabilities, such as in radar, the Neyman-Pearson criterion is used where a certain false alarm probability is set, and the probability of detection is maximised. In signal sensing problems of cognitive radio, the main constraint is to avoid the interference with the primary user. Once this constraint is met, a cognitive radio can maximise its own chance of finding an empty spectrum. In this paper we emphasise this view of the signal sensing problem and modify the criterion such that a maximum miss-detection rate is specified. We have reformulated the energy detector showing that the sensing results have more meaningful explanations under the modified criterion.

In the cognitive radio networks, each node recognizes radio conditions, and according to them, optimizes their wireless communication routes with the integration of the heterogeneous wireless systems not only by switching over them but also aggregating and utilizing them simultaneously. The Adaptive control of switchover use and concurrent use of various wireless systems will offer a stable and flexible wireless communication. In this paper, we propose the adaptive traffic route control scheme that provides high quality of service (QoS) for cognitive radio technology, and examine the performance of the proposed scheme through the field trials and computer simulations. The experimental results of field trials show that the adaptive route control according to the radio conditions improves the user IP throughput by more than 20% and reduce the one-way delay to less than 1/6 with the concurrent use of IEEE802.16 and IEEE802.11 wireless media. Moreover, the simulation results assuming hundreds of mobile terminals reveal that the number of users that satisfy the required QoS of voice over IP (VoIP) service and the total network throughput of FTP users increase by more than twice at the same time with the proposed algorithm. The proposed adaptive traffic route control scheme can provide the cognitive radio technologies the appropriate communication qualities to meet various demands for application QoS.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189120.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposal of adaptive traffic route control scheme in QoS provisioning for cognitive radio technology with heterogeneous wireless systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5189120/","displayDocTitle":"A proposal of adaptive traffic route control scheme in QoS provisioning for cognitive radio technology with heterogeneous wireless systems","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804116","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposal of adaptive traffic route control scheme in QoS provisioning for cognitive radio technology with heterogeneous wireless systems","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-80165-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103872S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEESent to SPI 7-22-09Camee back 7-30-09","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189133,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Pacheco-Paramo","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Pacheco-Paramo","id":"38295554200"},{"name":"Vicent Pla","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicent","lastName":"Pla","id":"37331147700"},{"name":"Jorge Martinez-Bauset","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Martinez-Bauset","id":"38269953500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189133","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189133","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Wireless communication","Interference","Switches","Quality of service","Termination of employment","Programmable logic arrays","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimal control","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal admission control","cognitive radio networks","spectrum handover technique","secondary users","forced termination probability","fractional guard channel reservation scheme","spectrum handovers","optimization problems","numerical experiments"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189133","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189133.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal admission control in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"We study a cognitive radio system in which the spectrum handover technique is applied by secondary users when they have to vacate a channel due to a primary user arrival.

We show that, contrary to what has been suggested, the reservation parameter cannot be adequately adjusted as a result of maximizing the throughput of secondary users.

With the time divisional and the time-frequency divisional cooperative spectrum sensing approaches the nodes share the spectrum sensing functions cooperatively, coordinating in time and frequency, covering the total frequency band and also in near-continuous time. In this paper we present the corresponding algorithms and techniques for the two cooperative spectrum sensing approaches, analyze their performances, and compare the advantages and disadvantages with each other.

In conventional cognitive radio, either overlay waveform is used to exploit unused (white) spectrum holes to avoid interference to primary users, or underlay waveform is employed to spread over a ultrawide bandwidth with extremely low power spectrum density to minimize interference to primary users. In our previous work, we proposed a novel hybrid overlay/underlay waveform to combine the benefits of both overlay and underlay waveform, creating a soft decision cognitive radio to exploit both the unused (white) spectral regions and the underused (gray) spectral areas. Extending the spectrally modulated spectrally encoded (SMSE) framework, we provide the framework for the proposed soft decision cognitive radio. We also evaluate the performance of the hybrid overlay/underlay waveform in frequency selective fading channels.

In this paper, two adaptive reinforcement learning based spectrum-aware routing protocols are introduced. Q-learning and dual reinforcement learning are applied respectively for them. The cognitive nodes store a table of Q values that estimate the numbers of available channels on the routes and update them while routing. So they can adaptively learn good routes which have more available channels from just local information. Compared to the previous spectrum aware routing protocols in multi-hop cognitive radio networks, they are simpler and easier to implement, more cost-effective, and can avoid drawbacks in on-demand protocols but still keep adaptive and dynamic routing. Both of our protocols perform better than the spectrum-aware shortest path protocol when network load is not too low. In the meantime, spectrum-aware DRQ-routing learns the optimal routing policy 1.5 times as fast as the spectrum-aware Q-routing at low and medium network load. It also learns a routing policy which is more than seven times as good as that of spectrum-aware Q-routing at high network load.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189189","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189189.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189189","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement learning based spectrum-aware routing in multi-hop cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement learning based spectrum-aware routing in multi-hop cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189189/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189189/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804125","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement learning based spectrum-aware routing in multi-hop cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-95763-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106578S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5189190,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Michel Dricot","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Group, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jean-Michel","lastName":"Dricot","id":"37540851900"},{"name":"Francois Horlin","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Group, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Horlin","id":"37268157100"},{"name":"Philippe De Doncker","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Group, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"De Doncker","id":"37319019000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189190","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Polarization","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Rayleigh channels","Random variables","Narrowband","Wireless communication","Closed-form solution","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","probability","radiowave propagation","telecommunication channels","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-polarized CDMA network","diversity technique","closed-form expression","probability","network topology","channel characteristics","code division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the use of the polarization as a diversity technique to allow the joint operation of co-located CDMA networks.

Fundamental is the need to exploit the free spectrum available and power efficient modulation where possible. The paper describes a variable power/bandwidth efficient modulation strategy where the modulation level is adjusted by cognitively determining the assignment and use of the available spectrum, taking into account the channel occupancy probability. Battery life for different techniques is also considered. Secondly, the paper discusses ways to reduce the complexity overall of cognitive radio systems, particularly in the need for spectrum sensing by exploiting distributed artificial intelligence. Techniques presented show how it is possible to largely eliminate the need for spectrum sensing, along with the associated energy consumption, by using reinforcement learning to develop a preferred channel set in each device. Finally, the paper discusses the potential benefits of the use of antenna directionality to improve energy efficiency, and the associated problems that still must be solved before this technique can deliver dasiagreenpsila radio.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189203","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189203.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using cognitive radio to deliver \u2018Green\u2019 communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189203/","displayDocTitle":"Using cognitive radio to deliver \u2018Green\u2019 communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804127","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189203/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using cognitive radio to deliver \u2018Green\u2019 communications","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-98045-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050155S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEESent to SPI 7-22-09Camee back 7-30-09","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5189204,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Lopez-Benitez","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Lopez-Benitez","id":"38274759600"},{"name":"Fernando Casadevall","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Casadevall","id":"37265720900"},{"name":"Anna Umbert","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Umbert","id":"37265633100"},{"name":"Jordi Perez-Romero","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Perez-Romero","id":"38276873900"},{"name":"Rachid Hachemani","affiliation":["SUPELEC, IETR, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Hachemani","id":"38344556100"},{"name":"Jacques Palicot","affiliation":["SUPELEC, IETR, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Palicot","id":"37269478700"},{"name":"Christophe Moy","affiliation":["SUPELEC, IETR, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Moy","id":"37294411000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189204","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"abstract":"Cognitive radio has been claimed to be a hopeful solution to the existing conflicts between spectrum demand growth and spectrum underutilization. The basic underlying idea of cognitive radio is to allow unlicensed users to access in an opportunistic and non-interfering manner some licensed bands temporarily unoccupied by licensed users. The cognitive radio concept relies on two basic premises: the current spectrum underutilization, which has been demonstrated in some spectrum measurements campaigns, and the ability of unlicensed users to effectively detect and identify the presence of different licensed technologies in order not to cause harmful interference. In this context, this paper reports the joint work on these two areas that is currently being carried out in the framework of the FP7 Network of Excellence in Wireless COMmunications (NEWCOM++). Concretely, this paper presents spectrum occupancy measurements conducted in the frequency range from 75 MHz to 7075 MHz that demonstrate the low degree to which spectrum is currently used in an urban outdoor environment and also describes the blind standard recognition sensor concept, a sensor embedded in a cognitive radio equipment to enable the identification of many commercial wireless standards without the need to connect to any network. The joint research in both areas is a key step in promoting and validating the idea of dynamic spectrum usage.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189204.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral occupation measurements and blind standard recognition sensor for cognitive radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement standards","Cognitive radio","Wireless sensor networks","Current measurement","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Interference","Context","Wireless communication","Frequency measurement","Radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral occupation measurements","blind standard recognition sensor","cognitive radio networks","spectrum underutilization","spectrum demand growth","unlicensed users","spectrum measurements campaigns","FP7 Network","wireless communications","NEWCOM++","frequency 75 MHz to 7075 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectral occupation measurements and blind standard recognition sensor for cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189204/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804128","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral occupation measurements and blind standard recognition sensor for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-98227-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055474S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5189217,"authors":[{"name":"Ohyun Jo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ohyun","lastName":"Jo","id":"37294302700"},{"name":"Hyun Ho Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun Ho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277428300"},{"name":"Dong-Ho Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Ho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276179200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189217","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Frequency","Quality of service","Propagation losses","Equations","Computer science","Telephony","Degradation","Performance loss","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum handover","cell outage","cognitive radio systems","service disruption"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seamless spectrum handover improving cell outage in cognitive radio systems","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189217","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189217","abstract":"In cognitive radio systems, there is a concern of service disruption because of spectrum handover. Spectrum handover occurs when a secondary user changes frequency due to the appearance of a primary user. Spectrum handover can be frequent if a cognitive radio system operates in a wide spectrum band. In this case, spectrum handover may drastically degrade the performance of cognitive radio systems because of the different propagation loss according to the usage of different frequency. Here, we propose a seamless spectrum handover scheme. The proposed handover scheme can avoid service disruption and can reduce redundant handovers. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is validated by simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10804129","htmlLink":"/document/5189217/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Seamless spectrum handover improving cell outage in cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seamless spectrum handover improving cell outage in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-98254-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042923S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189342,"authors":[{"name":"Haipeng Yao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory Oratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Haipeng Yao","id":"37530486300"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory Oratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"He Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory Oratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"He Liu","id":"37675893700"},{"name":"Luyong Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory Oratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Luyong Zhang","id":"37292620200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189342","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":598},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189342","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference constraints","Wireless communication","Chromium","Temperature","Helium","Wireless networks","Electronic mail","Admission control","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power allocation","joint spectrum overlay cognitive radio network","joint spectrum underlay cognitive radio network","maximum system utility","imperfect sensing knowledge","QoS sensitivity based admission control algorithm","RF interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sharing strategy","cognitive radio","interference constrains","optimal power allocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189342","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189342.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation in joint spectrum underlay and overlay cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the optimal power allocation strategy in the joint spectrum overlay and underlay cognitive radio network where a licensee and multiple unlicensed users coexist and operate in the same spectrum.

Frequency rendezvous is a critical step in bootstrapping a wireless network that does not possess centralized control. Current techniques for enabling frequency rendezvous in decentralized dynamic spectrum access networks either require pre-existing infrastructure or use one of several simplifying assumptions regarding the architecture, such as the use of regularly spaced frequency channels for communications. Our proposed approach is designed to be operated in a strictly decentralized wireless networking environment, where no centralized control is present and the spectrum does not possess pre-defined channels. This is accomplished via a combination of receiver pilot tones, a tone scanning protocol, and transmitter/receiver handshaking process. In our proposed rendezvous algorithm, the most important step is pilot tone detection and receiver query. In order to realize a shortest search time for the target receiver, an efficient scanning rule should be employed. In this paper, three scanning rules are proposed and evaluated, namely: frequency sequence scanning, pilot tone strength scanning, and cluster scanning. To validate our result, we test our scanning rules with actual paging band spectrum measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10804134","htmlLink":"/document/5189356/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A frequency rendezvous approach for decentralized dynamic spectrum access networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency rendezvous approach for decentralized dynamic spectrum access networks","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-36604-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07968S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189370,"authors":[{"name":"Janne Riihijarvi","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Riihijarvi","id":"37266544100"},{"name":"Petri Mahonen","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Mahonen","id":"37266541100"},{"name":"Marina Petrova","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Petrova","id":"37266543100"},{"name":"Vinay Kolar","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Kolar","id":"38318756100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189370","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":559},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Statistics","Engines","Wireless networks","Databases","Network topology","Wireless communication","Collaborative work","Radio transmitters","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio access networks","statistical analysis","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radios","spatial statistics","radio environment maps","topology engine","cognitive wireless networks"]}],"abstract":"Radio environment maps are a promising architectural concept for storing environmental information for use in cognitive wireless networks.

We discuss both technical and architectural issues in enabling such an approach, and outline some of the potential application scenarios for the topology engine.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189370","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189370.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189370","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing cognitive radios with spatial statistics: From radio environment maps to topology engine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing cognitive radios with spatial statistics: From radio environment maps to topology engine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189370/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189370/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804136","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing cognitive radios with spatial statistics: From radio environment maps to topology engine","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-32317-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081172S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5189371,"authors":[{"name":"Hany Kamal","affiliation":[" CNRS LTCI, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Kamal","id":"37391121900"},{"name":"Marceau Coupechoux","affiliation":[" CNRS LTCI, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marceau","lastName":"Coupechoux","id":"37391907600"},{"name":"Philippe Godlewski","affiliation":[" CNRS LTCI, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Godlewski","id":"37298520700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189371","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context-aware services","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Base stations","Resource management","Telecommunication traffic","Radio spectrum management","Pricing","Quality of service","Heuristic algorithms","Software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","optimisation","probability","quality of service","radio spectrum management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic study","heuristic DSA algorithm","cellular packet service","dynamic spectrum allocation","guaranteed quality of service","centralized model","sum-of-meta-operators reward","blocking probability threshold","fixed spectrum allocation","FSA reward maximization","arrival rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189371","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189371","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","abstract":"DSA (dynamic spectrum allocation) techniques are very challenging when the quality of service has to be guaranteed in a flexible spectrum situation. In this paper, we present and analyze DSA policies for packet services in cellular context. A centralized model, where a meta-operator shares a common spectrum among different operators, is considered. We focus on two criteria for the policies design: the total welfare (sum of operators' rewards), and the blocking probability. We go through two steps to pass from the actual FSA (fixed spectrum allocation) situation into DSA. First, DSA algorithms depend on the arrival rates. Second, DSA algorithms depend on both the arrival rates as well as the number of active users. Targeting the reward maximization shows to be inefficient when the blocking probability has to be guaranteed. However policies targeting a blocking probability threshold, achieve greater rewards then FSA rewards. We also present a heuristic DSA algorithm that takes into consideration: the arrival rates, the number of active users and the blocking probability. The algorithm gives a very close blocking probability to the one achieved using FSA, while the obtained reward significantly exceeds the FSA reward.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189371.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic studies for DSA policies in a simple cellular context with packet services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5189371/","displayDocTitle":"Traffic studies for DSA policies in a simple cellular context with packet services","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804137","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic studies for DSA policies in a simple cellular context with packet services","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-34306-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048777S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189384,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Shen","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Shen","id":"37394691600"},{"name":"Chengshi Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengshi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37396943400"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3423-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3424-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5189384","dbTime":"56 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Bandwidth","Detectors","Chromium","Clustering algorithms","Collaboration","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Monitoring","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","cooperative spectrum sensing","secondary user clusters","hard fusion","bandwidth constraints","optimal soft fusion scheme","double-threshold strategy"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User clusters based hierarchical cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189384.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189384","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189384","abstract":"This paper investigates secondary user clusters based cooperative spectrum sensing. Secondary users in the cognitive radio network are grouped into multiple clusters and the cooperative spectrum sensing is performed on a hierarchical architecture of these user clusters, through two levels of user collaborations. The low level cooperation is carried out within each cluster while the high level one is accomplished inside the cluster of the clusterheads. We propose soft fusion and hard fusion according to the bandwidth constraints of the control channels and the spectrum sensing agility requirement. An optimal soft fusion scheme and a double-threshold strategy are proposed to improve the overall spectrum sensing performance in soft fusion and hard fusion, respectively.

Prior to recognition, the constant modulus (CM) equalization is performed. Based on simulation results, this method can perform recognition task with high accuracy even at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and employing fairly small number of data samples.

The wavelet packets are derived from multistage tree-structured paraunitary filter banks. To enable the WPMCM system to co-exist with other licensed users (LU), the WPMCM transmission waveform characteristics are shaped to communicate in the idle time-frequency gaps of the LUs. This is done by vacating WPMCM carriers in and near the region of the LU spectrum. Furthermore, a spectrum estimation unit is tagged to the WPMCM transceiver structure by exploiting the filter bank infrastructure used for wavelet packet demodulation. Thus spectrum analysis is done at no additional cost. Through simulation studies the effectiveness of the system is demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189412.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Packet Multi-carrier modulation MIMO architecture for spectrum pooling systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet packets","MIMO","Filter bank","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Time frequency analysis","Spectral analysis","Transceivers","Demodulation","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","cognitive radio","MIMO systems","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet packet multi-carrier modulation","MIMO architecture","cognitive radio","time-frequency gaps","licensed users","spectrum estimation unit","paraunitary filter banks","spectrum pooling systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Packet Multi-carrier modulation MIMO architecture for spectrum pooling systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189412/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804142","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Packet Multi-carrier modulation MIMO architecture for spectrum pooling systems","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-13999-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055366S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEESent to SPI 7-22-09Camee back 7-30-09","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189413,"authors":[{"name":"Srikanth Pagadarai","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Srikanth","lastName":"Pagadarai","id":"37402675600"},{"name":"Alexander M.

Accuracy and speed of estimation are the key indicators to select the appropriate spectrum sensing technique. Conventional spectrum estimation techniques which are based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) suffer from familiar problems such as low frequency resolution, variance and high side lobes/leakages. In this article, the possibility of employing wavelet packet decomposition as a basis for new spectrum sensing approach is investigated. Three types of sources, namely partial band, single tone and swept tone, are used to investigate the performance of the proposed wavelet based approach. Swept tone source is a special kind of source devised to simulate the temporal dynamics in cognitive radio. The results of the experiments show that the wavelet based approach is quite promising for spectral estimation and can be a suitable technology for CR applications.","doi":"10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189426","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173448/5188906/05189426.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5188906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CROWNCOM.2009.5189426","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on the application of wavelet packet transforms to Cognitive Radio spectrum estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A study on the application of wavelet packet transforms to Cognitive Radio spectrum estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189426/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189426/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804082","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on the application of wavelet packet transforms to Cognitive Radio spectrum estimation","confLoc":"Hanover, Germany","sourcePdf":"62-10779-final_V3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058996S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173448","isNumber":"5188906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173448","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5188906","articleId":"5189426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEESent to SPI 7-22-09Camee back 7-30-09","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189427,"authors":[{"name":"Kok-Lim Alvin Yau","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Kok-Lim Alvin","lastName":"Yau","id":"37683359300"},{"name":"Peter Komisarczuk","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Komisarczuk","id":"37411435400"},{"name":"Paul D.

Given that the licensed or Primary Users (PUs) are oblivious to the presence of unlicensed or Secondary Users (SUs), Cognitive Radio (CR) is a new paradigm in wireless communication that allows the SUs to detect and use the underutilized licensed spectrums opportunistically and temporarily. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware and Intelligent Dynamic Channel Selection scheme that helps SUs to select channel adaptively for data transmission to enhance QoS, particularly throughput and delay. Our scheme is suitable for CR networks with mobile hosts. We formulate and design our scheme using Reinforcement Learning that offers a simple and yet practical solution.

In this new world of computing, users are universally required to accept the underlying premise of trust. Within the cloud computing world, the virtual environment lets users access computing power that exceeds that contained within their own physical worlds. Typically, users will know neither the exact location of their data nor the other sources of the data collectively stored with theirs. The data you can find in a cloud ranges from public source, which has minimal security concerns, to private data containing highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, medical records, or shipping manifests for hazardous material). Does using a cloud environment alleviate the business entities of their responsibility to ensure that proper security measures are in place for both their data and applications, or do they share joint responsibility with service providers? The answers to this and other questions lie within the realm of yet-to-be-written law. As with most technological advances, regulators are typically in a \"catch-up\" mode to identify policy, governance, and law. Cloud computing presents an extension of problems heretofore experienced with the Internet. To ensure that such decisions are informed and appropriate for the cloud computing environment, the industry itself should establish coherent and effective policy and governance to identify and implement proper security methods.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2009.87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2009.87","startPage":"61","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"IEEE Security & Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Security & Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel5/8013/5189548/05189563.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Security in the World of Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Data Security in the World of Cloud Computing","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10805344","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5189563/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Security in the World of Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"msp2009040061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084376S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8013","isNumber":"5189548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8013","citationCount":"347","xplore-issue":"5189548","articleId":"5189563","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":5189574,"authors":[{"name":"X Jin","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"X","lastName":"Jin","id":"37532608600"},{"name":"C M Collier","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"C M","lastName":"Collier","id":"37994210300"},{"name":"J F Holzman","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"J F","lastName":"Holzman","id":"38191854200"},{"name":"J Cheng","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"J","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277386100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3354-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3355-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"5189574","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"abstract":"Transmission characteristics of free-space optical (FSO) data transmission systems are characterized.

Among different transformations, the SubBytes transformation is the most expensive one in terms of the chip area and the power consumption in the hardware implementation of the AES. It consists of 16 S-boxes and hence the hardware optimization of the S-box is critical to reach a low-cost AES. In this paper, we present a low-cost S-box for the AES. Instead of using look-up tables for implementing the S-box, logic gate implementation based on a previously known low-complexity composite field using normal basis is utilized. Then, we present improved formulations for the inversion in the sub-fields within the S-box to reduce the area complexity of the implementations. After analyzing the complexities of the new architecture, we compare the ASIC implementation of the proposed S-box using 0:18mu CMOS technology with the previous ones. It is shown that the presented scheme has the lowest power consumption and area compared to its counterparts available in the open literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173449/5189546/05189583.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2009.5189583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2009.5189583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-cost S-box for the Advanced Encryption Standard using normal basis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Hardware","CMOS technology","Energy consumption","Logic gates","Application specific integrated circuits","NIST","Data security","Field programmable gate arrays","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","cryptography","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost S-box","advanced encryption standard","normal basis","secret key cryptographic standard","secure transfer","SubBytes transformation","chip area","power consumption","hardware optimization","look-up tables","logic gate implementation","low-complexity composite field","ASIC implementation","CMOS technology","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced encryption standard","composite fields","S-box"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A low-cost S-box for the Advanced Encryption Standard using normal basis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189583/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804178","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-cost S-box for the Advanced Encryption Standard using normal basis","confLoc":"Windsor, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"000052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054974S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173449","isNumber":"5189546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173449","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5189546","articleId":"5189583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5189620,"authors":[{"name":"Semih Aslan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Semih","lastName":"Aslan","id":"37399518000"},{"name":"Erdal Oruklu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Oruklu","id":"37300225600"},{"name":"Jafar Saniie","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Saniie","id":"37300151000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3354-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3355-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"5189620","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":508},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189620","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Arithmetic","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Newton method","Adaptive signal processing","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","echo suppression","MIMO communication","Newton-Raphson method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area efficient QR factorization","unified division","inverse square root hardware","signal processing","communication application","echo cancellation","adaptive beamforming","multiple-input-multiple-output systems","area-consuming arithmetic operation","unified hardware architecture","householder transformation","Newton-Raphson algorithm","Goldschmidt algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The QR factorization is used in many signal processing and communication applications such as echo cancellation, adaptive beamforming and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

First, we introduce a collision free frequency hopping (CFFH) system based on the OFDMA framework and an innovative secure subcarrier assignment scheme. The secure subcarrier assignment algorithm is designed to ensure that: (i) Each user hops to a new set of subcarriers in a pseudo-random manner at the beginning of each hopping period; (ii) Different users always transmit on non-overlapping sets of subcarriers, such that malicious users cannot predict or repeat the hopping pattern of the authorized users, and hence cannot launch follower jamming attacks. Second, we enhance the anti-jamming property of CFFH by incorporating the space-time coding (STC) scheme. The enhanced system is referred to as STC-CFFH. Our analysis indicates that STC-CFFH is particularly powerful in eliminating channel distortion and hostile jamming interference, including both random jamming and follower jamming attacks. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2009.5189623","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173449/5189546/05189623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2009.5189623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189546","startPage":"260","endPage":"265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jamming-resilient subcarrier assignment for OFDMA based space-time coded systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Jamming-resilient subcarrier assignment for OFDMA based space-time coded systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189623/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804218","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5189623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming-resilient subcarrier assignment for OFDMA based space-time coded systems","confLoc":"Windsor, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"000260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082443S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173449","isNumber":"5189546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173449","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5189546","articleId":"5189623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5189633,"authors":[{"name":"Swarna Bai Arniker","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Swarna Bai","lastName":"Arniker","id":"37992122200"},{"name":"Hon Keung Kwan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hon Keung","lastName":"Kwan","id":"37270884600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3354-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3355-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"5189633","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Sequences","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Digital signal processing","Biomedical signal processing","Fourier transforms","Data visualization","Humans","Organisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNA","Fourier transforms","genetics","signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNA sequences","genomic data","genomic signal processing","digital signal processing","Fourier transforms","wavelet transform","DNA sequence visualization","biological properties","DNA graphical representation"]}],"abstract":"The sequencing of genomic data requires methods to allow this data to be visualized and analyzed.

The proposed method uses extra registers to buffer and reorder the data inputs of the butterfly unit. It avoids the modulo-r addition in the address generation; hence, the critical path is significantly shorter than the conventional radix-4 FFT implementations. A significant property of the proposed method is that the critical path of the address generator is independent from the FFT transform length N, making it extremely efficient for large FFT transforms. For performance evaluation, the new FFT architecture has been implemented by FPGA (Altera Stratix) hardware and also synthesized by CMOS 0.18 mum technology. The results confirm the speed and area advantages for large FFTs. Although only radix-4 FFT address generation is presented in the paper, it can be used for higher radix FFT.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","CMOS technology","Counting circuits","Multiplexing","Registers","Field programmable gate arrays","Flexible printed circuits","Discrete Fourier transforms","Pipeline processing","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast memory addressing scheme","radix-4 FFT processor","address generator","fast Fourier transform","FPGA hardware","CMOS technology","field programmable gate arrays","size 0.18 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189656","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2009.5189656","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173449/5189546/05189656.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2009.5189656","startPage":"437","endPage":"440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189546","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast memory addressing scheme for radix-4 FFT implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast memory addressing scheme for radix-4 FFT implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189656/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189656/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804161","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast memory addressing scheme for radix-4 FFT implementation","confLoc":"Windsor, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"000437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06386S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173449","isNumber":"5189546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173449","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5189546","articleId":"5189656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5189662,"authors":[{"name":"David Hentrich","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hentrich","id":"37992119700"},{"name":"Erdal Oruklu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Oruklu","id":"37300225600"},{"name":"Jafar Saniie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Saniie","id":"37300151000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3354-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3355-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"5189662","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":500},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Random access memory","Inverters","Transistors","Voltage","Rails","MOSFETs","Predictive models","Microprocessors","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","nanoelectronics","performance evaluation","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM cell performance evaluation","predictive CMOS technology","static random access memory","low-power transistor process","self- controlled voltage level","size 22 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189662","abstract":"Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) units are often directly integrated onto the same die with the microprocessors and influence the design metrics significantly.

The main objective of this article is to characterize the speed and power consumption of five different SRAM cells in a predictive high performance 22 nm transistor process and in a predictive low power 22 nm transistor process. The five types of studied cells are traditional 6T, gated-ground 7T, full Self- Controlled Voltage Level (SVL) 12T, SVL 9T Footed, and SVL 9T Headed. The simulation results indicate that the timing behavior of SRAM cells are largely the same but power dissipation, leakage power in particular, vary significantly in 22 nm technology. The gated-ground 7T cells are deemed superior in the high performance process, while traditional 6T cells are deemed the best in the low power process.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2009.5189662","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5173449/5189546/05189662.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2009.5189662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of SRAM cells in 22nm predictive CMOS technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of SRAM cells in 22nm predictive CMOS technology","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189662/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10804167","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of SRAM cells in 22nm predictive CMOS technology","confLoc":"Windsor, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"000470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06264S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5173449","isNumber":"5189546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5173449","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5189546","articleId":"5189662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5189680,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The technology however imposes a challenge that is the increased complexity of channel equalization. Wireless channels are multipath fading channels, causing deformation in the signal. To remove the effect (imposed by channel) from received signal, the receiver needs to have knowledge of CIR (Channel impulse response) that is usually provided by a separate channel estimator. This paper is aimed at exploring the use of Neural Network (NN) as a tool for MIMO-OFDM channel estimation and compensation. The research attempts to gauges the usefulness of proposed system by analyzing different algorithms to train NN. Further to ascertain the performance of the proposed technique; length of the known training sequence has been varied over a reasonable range and observations are made. Finally, the results obtained by using different algorithms for training NN have been compared with each-other and against the traditional least squares channel estimator, which along with observations/comments form part of the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Based MIMO-OFDM Channel Equalizer Using Comb-Type Pilot Arrangement","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","doi":"10.1109/ICFCC.2009.136","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5189729/5189730/05189738.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFCC.2009.136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based MIMO-OFDM Channel Equalizer Using Comb-Type Pilot Arrangement","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189738/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10804477","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based MIMO-OFDM Channel Equalizer Using Comb-Type Pilot Arrangement","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3591a036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081358S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5189729","isNumber":"5189730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5189729","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5189730","articleId":"5189738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5189739,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Reza Hassanzadeh","affiliation":["Computer and Electrical engineering Faculty, Babol University of Technology, Babol, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Hassanzadeh","id":"37332111300"},{"name":"Mohammad Mehdi Mansouri Rad","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Faculty, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mehdi Mansouri","lastName":"Rad","id":"37297483000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3591-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5189739","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical filters","Optical fiber communication","Intersymbol interference","Bit error rate","Intensity modulation","Random variables","Electrical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intersymbol interference","multipath channels","radio receivers","shot noise","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference reduction","indoor infrared systems","receiver structure","multipath effect","infrared diffuse links","bit error rate","noise sources","ambient light","signal shot noise","dark current","thermal noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Infrared systems","Inter-symbol Interference","Root Mean Square Delay Spread"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189739","abstract":"A new and simple receiver structure for reducing the multipath inter-symbol interference (ISI) effect is proposed for infrared diffuse links.

A non cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power, transmit symbol rate as well as the constellation size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay quality of service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed and it is particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. It is shown that in order to maximize the userpsilas utility, a user must choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the userpsilas delay constraint. This strategy is different from one that could maximize spectral efficiency. Using this approach, the trade offs among energy efficiency, delay, throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified. The effect of Trellis coded modulation on energy efficiency is discussed additionally.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5189729/5189730/05189753.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"116","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","doi":"10.1109/ICFCC.2009.18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFCC.2009.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Game Theoretic Approach for Energy Efficient Modulation in MC-DS-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Energy efficiency","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Quality of service","Delay","Modulation coding","Power system modeling","OFDM","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","game theory","quadrature amplitude modulation","trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theoretic approach","energy efficient modulation","MC-DS-CDMA","M-QAM modulation","non cooperative game","Trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC DS CDMA","M-QAM","QoS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Game Theoretic Approach for Energy Efficient Modulation in MC-DS-CDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189753/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10804492","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Game Theoretic Approach for Energy Efficient Modulation in MC-DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3591a112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065718S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5189729","isNumber":"5189730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5189729","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5189730","articleId":"5189753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189755,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Espandar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Espandar","id":"37992228600"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Bakhshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Bakhshi","id":"37391805700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3591-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5189755","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Antenna arrays","Fading","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Sensor arrays","Receiving antennas","Multiple signal classification","Transmitting antennas","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","direction-of-arrival estimation","fading channels","MIMO communication","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rectangular antenna array","multipath fading channels","MIMO channels","code division multiple access","TLS-ESPRIT algorithm","direction-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unitary TLS-ESPRIT","DOA estimation","fading channel","multipath channels","CDMA"]}],"abstract":"This paper concerns the direction of arrival (DOA)estimation for code division multiple access (CDMA) frequency on-selective and slow fading multipath and multi input multioutput (MIMO) channels.

Shape adaptive discrete wavelet transform (SA-DWT) can transform the regions of interest and the background on the images independently and the coefficients can be encoded by using the SPIHT coding at different levels.

Even though shortest path routing algorithms are well established, other alternative methods may have their own advantages. One such alternative is to use a GA-based routing algorithm. Based on previous research, GA-based routing algorithm has been found to be more scalable and insensitive to variations in network topologies. However, it is also known that GA-based routing algorithm is not fast enough for real-time computation. In this paper, we proposed a parallel genetic algorithm for solving the shortest path routing problem with the aim to reduce its computation time. This algorithm is developed and run on an MPI cluster. Based on experimental result, there is a tradeoff between computation time and the result accuracy. However, for the same level of accuracy, the proposed parallel algorithm can perform much faster compared to its non-parallel counterpart.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189787/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10804526","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189787/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Shortest Path Routing Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Shortest Path Routing Problem","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3591a268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061047S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5189729","isNumber":"5189730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5189729","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5189730","articleId":"5189787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":5189788,"authors":[{"name":"Go Yun Ii","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Go Yun","lastName":"Ii","id":"37992128100"},{"name":"K.

The future switch should perform high speed switching, eliminate the implementation of buffers, transparent packet format and allows multiple user access. Thus, the development of a heuristic approach that handles multi protocol label swapping (MPLS) and supports all optical label swapping (AOLS) routing protocols via the implementation of optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) datagram is necessary. Consequently, to prepare for contention conditions, WDM can be integrated with OCDMA that offers more channels and network capacity. It harnesses enormous bandwidth by coupling multiple wavelengths into a single fiber. This should reduce the probability of packet loss due to contention. Furthermore, the orthogonal code and label swapping enhance the network throughput. Also, this paper investigates the possibility of the realization of WDM/OCDMA and the simulation results from the preliminary study are compared with the conventional approaches. Relatively, the work is aimed to characterize all components making up the router/switch that consists of the multiplexer, demultiplexer, encoder and decoder. Several relevant issues and the limitations are discussed by considering the features and requirements aforementioned.","doi":"10.1109/ICFCC.2009.124","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5189729/5189730/05189788.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFCC.2009.124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preliminary Study of Heuristic Approach for WDM/OCDMA Switch in Future Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189788/","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary Study of Heuristic Approach for WDM/OCDMA Switch in Future Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10804527","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189788/","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preliminary Study of Heuristic Approach for WDM/OCDMA Switch in Future Network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3591a274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081462S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5189729","isNumber":"5189730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5189729","xplore-issue":"5189730","articleId":"5189788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5189792,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Han Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Han","lastName":"Liao","id":"38000141400"},{"name":"Min-Hui Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Hui","lastName":"Ho","id":"37591374700"},{"name":"Chien-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taipei College of Maritime Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Hung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37367494200"},{"name":"Chien-Ching Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Ching","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37276698500"},{"name":"Wei-Chun Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Chun","lastName":"Chung","id":"38008685300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3591-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5189792","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","FCC","Pulse circuits","Pulse shaping methods","Pulse generation","Design methodology","Ultra wideband technology","Bandwidth","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","indoor radio","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-UWB pulses","genetic algorithm","pulse design method","spectrum utilization rate","ultrawide band system","signal-to-noise ratio","Gaussian pulse","indoor UWB system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pulse design","UWB","GA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189792","abstract":"This paper proposes a new pulse design method to improve spectrum utilization rate and reduce the outage probability in ultra wide band (UWB) system.

This method is an easy way to achieve in practical circuit implementation compared to one pulse generator, since COMS circuit is hard to produce one pulse with short duration and complex pulse shape. Comparisons with the traditional Gaussian pulse, the synthesis pulse by GA not only satisfy the FCC emission mask but also have high spectrum utilization rate. Simulation results show that the performances in indoor UWB system using the synthesis pulse by GA is better than that using traditional Gaussian pulse. Numerical results show that the synthesis pulse by GA is higher 30 percent of spectrum utilization rate and lower 65 percent of outage probability for the same transmission power, as well as lower 21 percent of outage probability for fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)at the receiver comparing with traditional Gaussian pulse.

The neural network employed in this paper is primarily used as a nonlinear mapper between 2D image points and points of a certain space in 3D real world. The neural network model implicitly contains all the physical parameters, some of which are very difficult to be estimated in the conventional calibration methods. MutiLayer perceptron type neural network (MLPNN) is employed to implement the relationship between image coordinates. In order to show the performance of the proposed method, we carry out experiments on the estimation of 2D image coordinates given 3D real world coordinates. The experimental results show that the proposed method improved calibration accuracy over widely used Tsai's two stage method (TSM).","doi":"10.1109/ICFCC.2009.94","startPage":"358","endPage":"362","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5189729/5189730/05189805.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFCC.2009.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Method for Camera Calibration Using MultiLayer Perceptron Type Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Calibration","Multilayer perceptrons","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Nonlinear distortion","Lenses","Artificial neural networks","Optical distortion","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","calibration","cameras","image processing","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptron type neural network","3D camera calibration method","nonlinear modeling function","artificial neural network","nonlinear mapper","2D image point","2D image estimation","Tsai two stage method","image coordinates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Method for Camera Calibration Using MultiLayer Perceptron Type Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10804544","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Method for Camera Calibration Using MultiLayer Perceptron Type Neural Network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3591a358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067561S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5189729","isNumber":"5189730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5189729","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5189730","articleId":"5189805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5189811,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Espandar","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Espandar","id":"37992228600"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Bakhshi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Bakhshi","id":"37391805700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3591-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5189811","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":583},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Fading","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Multiple signal classification","Frequency estimation","Radio transmitters","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","direction-of-arrival estimation","fading channels","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angle-of-arrival estimation","angle-of-departure estimation","rectangular antenna array","nonselective slow fading channel","MIMO channel","uniform rectangular antenna array","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","multiple input multiple output channel model","code division multiple access","CDMA","subspace-based algorithm","2D unitary ESPRIT-like shift invariance technique","automatic parameter set pairing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ESPRIT","AOA and AOD","fading channel","MIMO channels","CDMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the use of uniform rectangular antenna arrays for both transmitter (Tx)-and receiver (Rx)-antennas in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel model for code division multiple access (CDMA) frequency on-selective and slow fading channel.

But, the efficient recognition is depending on the quality of fingerprint image and it is a complex computer problem while dealing with noisy and low quality images. The most common methods used to acquire the fingerprint images do not need expertise, but highly distorted images are still possible because of dryness of skin, skin disease, dirt or humidity. Therefore such type of images must be de-noised for recognition. Many researchers have proved advantages of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for image de-nosing. DWT in image de-noising has limitations due to its non-invariance in time/space. The time invariant property of SWT is useful for de-noising the image. In this paper we have studied effectiveness of orthogonal and bi-orthogonal wavelet transforms with different decomposition level using SWT. And the quality of de-noised image is evaluated through structural distortion measurement and also measured the computational processing time at each level. Our results show coifl at level 5 gives the best results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fingerprint Image De-noising through Decimated and Un-decimated Wavelet Transforms (WT)","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","doi":"10.1109/ICFCC.2009.101","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Future Computer and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5189729/5189730/05189834.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFCC.2009.101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5189730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5189834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5189834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint Image De-noising through Decimated and Un-decimated Wavelet Transforms (WT)","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5189834/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10804573","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint Image De-noising through Decimated and Un-decimated Wavelet Transforms (WT)","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3591a500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098827S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5189729","isNumber":"5189730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5189729","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5189730","articleId":"5189834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5189865,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Z.
