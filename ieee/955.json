The expression of intention based on biological signal is a natural way. Eye movement plays an important role in human interaction with the environment which is suitable as a control instruction. Eye movement signals have certain temporal feature in Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We collected the eye movement signals by an EEG headset with dry electrodes with high performance. At the same time, deep learning has shown great success in EEG signal processing. In this work, a shallow 2D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure is proposed to classify the eye movements in 4 directions of upward, downward, leftward and rightward in EEG signals, which are used as 4 kinds of commands to control virtual aircraft. The data are fed to the network through the simulation training experiment designed by us. The average accuracy of the 4 eye movement directions was 88.13%, 86.59%, 87.78% and 87.85% respectively. Among the 10 subjects, the highest accuracy was 92.71%, the lowest was 84.88%, and the total average accuracy was 87.59%, which proves the effectiveness of the scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550039/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550039/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"EEG Based Eye Movements Multi-Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012335","fundingName":"National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG Based Eye Movements Multi-Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090785S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9550048,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, P.

The plant considered in this paper is equipped with a slow-rate sensor and a fast-rate actuator. In the presence of non-vanishing disturbance, a new output predictor-based observer is first proposed by only using the delayed sampled-data output, so as to effectively estimate system state and disturbance in the inter-sample time interval. A new sampled-data controller that updates at a fast-rate is then designed with the help of active anti-disturbance technique. Thanks to prediction and active anti-disturbance techniques, the proposed sampled-data control method can effectively reject the influence of non-vanishing disturbance despite slow-rate sampling and delay of sensor. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated via simulation results of a practical example of the visual servoing control for an inertially stabilized platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550065/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","accessionNumber":"21225639","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Predictor-Based Active Anti-Disturbance Control for Multi-Rate Control Systems with Delayed Sampled-Data","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012152","fundingName":"National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictor-Based Active Anti-Disturbance Control for Multi-Rate Control Systems with Delayed Sampled-Data","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064314S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9550077,"authors":[{"name":"Fuchun Liu","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering The Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control(ASNC), Ministry of Education South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, P.

Compared with the traditional HD endoscope system, the UHD endoscope image acquisition system designed in this article uses FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Array) as the processing center. The image resolution is increased from 1920*1080 to 3840*2160. Our system designed a physical layer and protocol layer of MIPI CSI-2 interface that can support 30 frame per second. It proves that our image acquisition system is practical and stable for medical endoscope image acquisition systems and also suitable for ultra-high-definition image systems in other fields.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550077","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09550077.pdf","startPage":"5668","endPage":"5673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A UHD MIPI CSI-2 image acquisition system based on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550077/","displayDocTitle":"A UHD MIPI CSI-2 image acquisition system based on FPGA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550077/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A UHD MIPI CSI-2 image acquisition system based on FPGA","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054003S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9550090,"authors":[{"name":"Sijian Liao","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","China State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex System, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sijian","lastName":"Liao","id":"37088984372"},{"name":"Zhihong Peng","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","China State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex System, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhihong","lastName":"Peng","id":"37088497238"},{"name":"Junqi Cai","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","China State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex System, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junqi","lastName":"Cai","id":"37087054222"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9550090","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","MIMO radar","Simulation","Radar","Radar tracking","Search problems","Bayes methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource Scheduling","BCRLB","Target Tracking","Power Allocation","MIMO Radar Systems"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an effective joint beam selection and power allocation (JBSPA) method is proposed to solve the online resource scheduling problem for multi-target tracking in distributed MIMO radar system. Overall target tracking performance can be improved by optimizing radar system beam selection and power allocation, since each MIMO radar can generate a time-varying beam, and adjust the quality of the observed signal by controlling the transmit power of each beam. In our method the feedback information of the target tracking period is used to complete the optimal radar-targets assignment and power allocation, the objective function is formulated based on the Bayesian Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound, as the formulated JBSPA problem is non-convex, a three steps solution method based on reward matrix is proposed to solve it effectively. Numerical results show that the proposed JBSPA method can deliver better performance than the competitors in overall MTT performance.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550090","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09550090.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Scheduling Base on Bayesian Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Multi-Target Tracking in Netted Colocated MIMO Radar Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resource Scheduling Base on Bayesian Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Multi-Target Tracking in Netted Colocated MIMO Radar Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550090/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550090/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Scheduling Base on Bayesian Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Multi-Target Tracking in Netted Colocated MIMO Radar Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055496S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9550095,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Cao","affiliation":["Research Center of Nonlinear Science, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Cao","id":"37088986814"},{"name":"Cheng Zhang","affiliation":["Research Center of Nonlinear Science, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088981620"},{"name":"Zhenzhen Xiong","affiliation":["Research Center of Nonlinear Science, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhenzhen","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37088980730"},{"name":"Ting Wang","affiliation":["Research Center of Nonlinear Science, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088986258"},{"name":"Junchao Chen","affiliation":["Research Center of Nonlinear Science, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Junchao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088984920"},{"name":"Bengong Zhang","affiliation":["Research Center of Nonlinear Science, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China","School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bengong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088757230"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9550095","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Image recognition","Time series analysis","Supervised learning","Data preprocessing","Data visualization","Trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time series classification","Recurrence plot","Convolutional Neural Network","Image recognition classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550095","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved great success in image recognition tasks by automatically learning hierarchical feature representations from raw data.

In order to guarantee the accurate response prediction, the performance of three different types of surrogate models, namely polynomial response surface (PRS), Kriging and radial basis function (RBF) models are built with sampling points generated by Latin hypercube design (LHD) method. With Kriging surrogate model best fitting the data, it is chosen as the model for performance prediction during the optimization process. It is also shown that the NSGA-II algorithm is suitable for the multi-objective optimization of gas turbine. The robustness of the Pareto solutions are checked under the varying ambient pressure and temperature. By considering the solution robustness, and the nature of gas turbine performance change under perturbation, the optimal operating conditions are identified.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550112/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550112/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Multi-Objective Optimization for Gas Turbine Operation Based on Kriging Surrogate Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Multi-Objective Optimization for Gas Turbine Operation Based on Kriging Surrogate Model","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068152S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9550135,"authors":[{"name":"Jilong Zhuang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex Systems of Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

Therefore, based on the actual geographical wiring diagram and related data, this paper describes a grid model to analyze the influence of BESS connected to the power grid on power flow and node voltage. When the voltage of each node is stable, the genetic algorithm is applied to study how to select the access position and control the power of centralized or distributed BESSs to minimize the active power loss of the power grid.

The experiments show that our proposed scheme adopted in integrated model can achieve the better performance than some state-of-the-art approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550147/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Model Combining CNN-GRU with ARIMA for pressure prediction of water supply network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Model Combining CNN-GRU with ARIMA for pressure prediction of water supply network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100699S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9550168,"authors":[{"name":"Wenqiang Cao","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Wenqiang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37088986817"},{"name":"Jing Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yan","id":"38026528600"},{"name":"Xian Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Xian","lastName":"Yang","id":"38237905400"},{"name":"Xiaoyuan Luo","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyuan","lastName":"Luo","id":"37399487200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9550168","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autonomous underwater vehicles","Simulation","Stochastic processes","Reinforcement learning","Interference","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)","reinforcement learning","formation","model interferences"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning-Based Formation Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with Model Interferences","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","endPage":"4025","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09550168.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550168","startPage":"4020","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550168","abstract":"The formation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a promising technology. This requires multiple AUVs interact information to maintain the desired distribution of formation. At present, the formation control of AUVs has a wide range of application prospects, such as underwater environment exploration and protection. However, the formation control of AUVs becomes very complicated and difficult due to stochastic interferences in the underwater environment. Considering this situation, this paper is to study the formation problem of AUVs in underwater environment with multiple interferences. This paper formulates Multivariate Probabilistic Collocation Method (MPCM) to deal with the interferences acting on AUVs. In addition, the formation control of AUVs is also accomplished by means of reinforcement learning (RL). Particularly, the above controller can overcome multiple unknown interferences of AUVs, instead of just one specific interference, and improves the practicality of the algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the formation controller proposed by the simulation results is given. The results show that all the errors meet our expectations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550168/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning-Based Formation Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with Model Interferences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning-Based Formation Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with Model Interferences","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073373S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":9550169,"authors":[{"name":"Shuyu Tantai","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, P.

In this paper, we propose an Interrelated Fusion CNN (IRF-CNN) with more attention on the non-occluded facial regions for expression recognition. With a new patch masking scheme, facial landmark patches and their corresponding contextual patches are obtained. A self-attentive mechanism assigns the patches with some attentive weights, which reflects their importance for expression recognition task. Two groups of patches corresponding to high and low weights respectively are obtained by analogous pooling with statistical indicators of their attentive weights. The adaptive grouping scheme could assign the key non-occluded patches for facial expression into the high-weight groups, especially in the case of unbalanced weight distribution. An interrelated fusion module with an attention stacking strategy is proposed for integrating complementary and reinforcing representation of the two groups of patches. IRFCNN is evaluated on in-the-lab facial expression datasets (CK+, Jaffe) and in-the-wild facial expression datasets (SFEW, RAF, FED-RO). Experiment results validate that the proposed method has a competitive performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550169/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interrelated Fusion CNN with Statistical Grouping among Multipatches for Occluded Facial Expression Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interrelated Fusion CNN with Statistical Grouping among Multipatches for Occluded Facial Expression Recognition","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064323S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9550193,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhi","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhi","id":"37088835243"},{"name":"Weikui Liang","affiliation":["Aerospace System Engineering Shanghai, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weikui","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086419511"},{"name":"Peng Han","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Han","id":"37086928427"},{"name":"Yanning Guo","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yanning","lastName":"Guo","id":"37536127600"},{"name":"Chuanjiang Li","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chuanjiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37278181400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9550193","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550193","abstract":"Compared to the conventional Earth observation satellites, the agile Earth observation satellites have stronger attitude adjustment capability along three axes which also make the scheduling problem more difficult.

Then, we propose a new coding method that includes the actual observation start time and the observation duration. Based on the good continuous space search ability of the quantum genetic algorithm, we design the corresponding quantum genetic algorithm which searches in both discrete domain and continuous domain.

Meanwhile, the real-time calculation of aerodynamic parameters can be realized by combining with the undeviated aerodynamic parameters preloaded by aircraft. Compared with the cyclic neural network, the algorithm increases the forgetting coefficient and avoids the gradient explosion and gradient vanishing problems. At the same time, a fully connected neural network is added behind the LSTM network to make the identification results more accurate.Firstly, the kinematics model of aircraft is established to determine the required identification parameters, and training data is generated based on the model. Then, the parameter identification network connected with LSTM network and single hidden layer fully connected network is constructed, and the data is input for network training. Finally, the trained network is used for parameter identification.

malicious denial of service (DoS) attacks. A robust and secure clock synchronization scheme based on filter is proposed in intermittent DoS attack case, which is composed of three steps: relative skew estimation, clock skew compensation and software clock reading compensation. Through the clock skew compensation, the synchronization error of the clock skew can be constrained into a bounded range. Through the software clock reading compensation, the possible error of the software clock reading can be compensated and the clock synchronization can be achieved completely. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted which validate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550308/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550308/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Robust Clock Synchronization Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks against DoS Attacks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Clock Synchronization Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks against DoS Attacks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081171S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9550331,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Huang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088985009"},{"name":"Guo-Ping Liu","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Ping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37281349700"},{"name":"Wenshan Hu","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenshan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37288603100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9550331","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge engineering","Neural networks","Time series analysis","Wind power generation","Predictive models","Power grids","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wind power forecasting","output feedback neural network","domain knowledge","short-term forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550331","abstract":"Under the dual stimulation of the grid requirements for renewable energy and the demand to reduce the cost of wind power, the wind power forecasting begins to be in a position that cannot be ignored. In order to overcome the challenge of high randomness of wind, a theory-guided output feedback neural network (Tg-OFNN) is proposed for short-term wind power forecasting. According to the known characteristics of the wind turbine, the wind power is decomposed into a fixed part and an uncertain part, in which the first part is expressed by a known mathematical model, and the second part is approximated by OFNN because of its strong ability to fit the nonlinear relationship. Part of data from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 is used to verify the performance of the proposed model. The results of the case study show that the introduction of domain knowledge improves the forecasting performance of the model, and the memory function is significant to deal with time series such as wind power.

Moreover, the conservatism comparison of the criteria are illustrated through one numerical example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550360/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550360/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Global exponential stability analysis of neural networks with an interval time-varying delay via an extended free-matrix-based double integral inequality","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008852","fundingName":"Xianyang Normal University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global exponential stability analysis of neural networks with an interval time-varying delay via an extended free-matrix-based double integral inequality","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081117S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9550423,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Tao Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Meng-Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088982215"},{"name":"Fu-Min Ma","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fu-Min","lastName":"Ma","id":"38082245400"},{"name":"Jie Lv","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Lv","id":"37088980934"},{"name":"Xiao-Wei Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Wei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37088981270"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9550423","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Neural networks","Rough sets","Information processing","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular Neural Network","Cross-boundary Region","Biased Selection","Fuzzy Rough C-means Clustering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550423","abstract":"In view that the traditional modular neural network did not consider the bias of the samples in the cross-boundary region to the cluster attribution when dividing the clustering module, which leads to the data sample hybridity and the poor performance of the final neural network model. This paper presents a modular neural network based on the biased selection of samples in the boundary region. By combining the two-stage clustering of Canopy and fuzzy rough C-means clustering, the number of clusters is adaptively determined, and then the modules are divided. At the same time, taking advantage of the rough-set in uncertain information processing, the samples in the lower approximation set and cross-boundary region are studied separately, and the bias threshold is introduced to further divide the samples in the boundary region. The proposed modular neural network can make the new input sample find the sub network more accurately. The experimental results show that the modular neural network based on the biased selection of samples in the boundary region has obvious advantages in the prediction accuracy and the generalization performance.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550423","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09550423.pdf","startPage":"8304","endPage":"8309","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular Neural Network based on Biased Selection of Boundary Region Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Modular Neural Network based on Biased Selection of Boundary Region Samples","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550423/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular Neural Network based on Biased Selection of Boundary Region Samples","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060147S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9550463,"authors":[{"name":"ZhiPeng Li","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, P.

The problems of transmission delay, external interference and packet loss in the system are emphatically considered. A Bernoulli distributed variable is introduced to describe the dynamic characteristics of packet loss in the transmission channel. Two zero-order holders are used to synchronize the time of using sampled data. To deal with the influences of the unknown external disturbances, adaptive controllers based on the neural network are designed. By choosing appropriate Lyapunov functions, the asymptotic stability of the teleoperation system is proved.

However, the state-of-the-art works on MEC offloading pay little attention to the dependencies among subtasks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a directed acyclic weighted graph to denote the dependencies among subtasks. Besides, we propose a blockchain-enabled multi-MEC environment and transform the utility maximization problem into a multi-choice knapsack problem, the NP-hardness of this problem is proved in this paper. To obtain the near-optimal solution, we further develop a double auction mechanism, called long-term auction for inner-dependent task offloading (LAIO). Experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than the benchmarks (RTO, DPESO, and PSO). The proposed algorithm LAIO outperforms the algorithms RTO, DPESO, and PSO by 53.8%, 16.2%, and 40.1% in terms of total utility, respectively. Moreover, the proposed algorithm LAIO can ensure the long-term computation offloading performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term Auction for Inner-Dependent Task Offloading in Blockchain-Enabled Edge Computing","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550569","startPage":"1881","endPage":"1886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09550569.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Long-term Auction for Inner-Dependent Task Offloading in Blockchain-Enabled Edge Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550569/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term Auction for Inner-Dependent Task Offloading in Blockchain-Enabled Edge Computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079263S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9550573,"authors":[{"name":"Jinfeng Zhan","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, GuangZhou"],"firstName":"Jinfeng","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37088498078"},{"name":"Weidong Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, GuangZhou"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088496382"},{"name":"Weirong Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, GuangZhou"],"firstName":"Weirong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088983265"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9550573","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Redundancy","Clustering algorithms","Real-time systems","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["YOLOv3","K","means++","Focal Loss","Improved NMS","Egohands"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550573","abstract":"In order to solve the problem of low accuracy and serious redundancy of traditional gesture detection algorithms in first-view and multi-gesture scenarios, this paper proposes an improved gesture detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 network framework.

The dynamics of the transit process from the rotor wing mode to fixed wing mode is difficult to obtained, and thus degrading the performance of the controller. To deal with this problem, this paper proposed a new control approach based on the concept of incremental back-stepping (IBKS) method. With feedback of actuator states and angular acceleration, IBKS provides increments of control which reduced dependency on mathematical model of aircraft system. Then, a tracking differentiator is applied to calculate the states of the aircraft dynamics for better estimation of angular accelerations.

The proposed control scheme utilizes RBF-neural network to learn the behavior of the unknown plant dynamics. Filtered signals are employed to circumvent algebraic loop problems encountered in the implementation of the existing controllers. Backstepping design technique is applied to deal with system dynamics. Based on the Lyapunov-like synthesis, we show that all signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded over a pre-specified time interval [0, T ]. There even exist initial state errors, the norm of tracking error vector will asymptotically converge to a tunable residual set as iteration goes to infinity. A time-varying boundary layer is introduced to solve the problem of initial state error. A typical series is introduced in order to deal with the unknown bound of the approximation errors and complete the non-uniform trajectory tracking problem. Finally, the simulation example of one-link robot system shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550655","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09550655.pdf","startPage":"532","endPage":"539","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-uniform trajectory tracking adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear pure-feedback systems with initial state error based on RBF-neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Non-uniform trajectory tracking adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear pure-feedback systems with initial state error based on RBF-neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550655/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-uniform trajectory tracking adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear pure-feedback systems with initial state error based on RBF-neural network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.177996S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9550655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9550697,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zihao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, P.

Human gaits are periodic, with each gait cycle containing the important gait events of mid-swing, heel-strike (HS), and toe-off. The correct identification of different gait patterns caused by stroke or progressive neurodegenerative Parkinson\u2019s disease could ensure that the patients receive appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies. However, online detection of gait events can be challenging because each person has their own walking patterns and speeds. This paper applies recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to develop a model that can instantly detect important gait events in any subject. We collected clinical gait data and used them to develop an RNN model for real-time detection of HS. The model correctly recognized HS events with an average success rate of 98.84% and an average delay of 0.024 s in the laboratory environment. We then applied the model to three different groups of subjects: healthy elderly subjects, stroke patients, and patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. The developed RNN model also correctly recognized HS events in all three groups with an average accuracy of more than 99.65%, even though the subjects had very different walking patterns. In the future, the developed gait detection model can be integrated with real-time rehabilitation systems to provide patients with repetitive guidance using clinician-determined cures for enhanced clinical gait training.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116047","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09550768.pdf","startPage":"134849","endPage":"134857","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Detection of Gait Events by Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Detection of Gait Events by Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21103568","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550768/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 107-2634-F-002-018, MOST 108-2634-F-002-016, MOST 109-2634-F-002-027 and MOST 110-2634-F-002-042"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100019001","fundingName":"Center for Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Robotics, National Taiwan University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Real-Time Detection of Gait Events by Recurrent Neural Networks","society":["IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society Section"],"sourcePdf":"access-wang-3116047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095538S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9550768","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9550770,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Fukada","affiliation":["Waseda University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9550770/fukad-3116038-small.gif","p":["Keisuke Fukada (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in communications and computer engineering from Waseda University, in 2021, where he is currently pursuing the M.Eng. degree.

However, the obtained solution much depends on the initial spin states, since the computation time is finite. Moreover, due to their probabilistic nature, they cannot always satisfy the constraints given to combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a three-stage annealing method, targeting a slot-placement problem as a typical but difficult example of combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed method is composed of an initial process, an annealing process, and a correction process. The initial process and the correction process are executed by a classical computer while the annealing process is executed by an Ising machine. In the initial process, we give initial spin values that lead to a relatively good solution to the combinatorial optimization problem, which satisfies the given constraints. Then, the annealing process is executed by an Ising machine, and the solution obtained by the annealing process is further corrected to satisfy the constraints. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces a minimum total weighted wiring length by 0.0898%\u20132.45% on average depending on the initial process methods used, compared to the existing method. The mean total weighted wiring length is reduced by 2.79%\u20137.08% on average depending on the initial process methods used.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09550770.pdf","startPage":"134413","endPage":"134426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Stage Annealing Method Solving Slot-Placement Problems Using an Ising Machine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Annealing","Wiring","Urban areas","Linear programming","Wires","Search problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ising machine","Ising model","QUBO model","slot-placement problem","initial process","correction process","combinatorial optimization problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Stage Annealing Method Solving Slot-Placement Problems Using an Ising Machine","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9550770/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Three-Stage Annealing Method Solving Slot-Placement Problems Using an Ising Machine","sourcePdf":"access-fukada-3116038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133296S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9550770","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9550779,"authors":[{"name":"Astrid Lozada","affiliation":["Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valpara\u00edso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9550779/lozad-3115998-small.gif","p":["Astrid Lozada received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda (UTFSM), Chile, in 2020, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering.

NCI 1\u20134 are transparent configurations based on all-EDFA, hybrid Raman/EDFA amplifiers (with different Raman gain ratio \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Gamma _{R}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n), all-DFRA, and alternating span configuration (EDFA and DFRA). NCI 5 is a translucent configuration based on all-EDFA and 3R regenerators. We model the physical layer for every network configuration to determine the maximum achievable reach of optical signals. Employing simulation, we calculate the blocking probability and the energy consumption of the different network configurations. In terms of blocking, our results show that NCI 2 and 3 offer the lowest blocking probability, with at least 1 and 3 orders of magnitude of difference with respect to NCI 1 and 5 at high and low traffic loads, respectively. In terms of energy consumption, the best performing alternatives are the ones with the worst blocking (NCI 1), while NCI 3 exhibits the highest energy consumption with NCI \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\,\\,\\Gamma _{R}=0.75$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n following closely.

problem faced by electricity enterprises. The data collected by the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) makes it possible to identify electricity theft based on a data-driven method. However, among the data-driven methods, the methods based on supervised learning, unsupervised learning and state estimation have their advantages and disadvantages, which can not play a full role. This paper presents a combined data-driven identification framework, which combines the advantages of the supervised method (day-week-month load convolutional neural network (DWML-CNN)), unsupervised method (clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP)) and state estimation method. Firstly, the features are extracted based on the state estimation, then the unsupervised and supervised methods are used to determine the suspicion ranks respectively. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation is made according to the two suspicion ranks. Experimental results show that the framework has good performance on the data set of the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).","doi":"10.1109/PRAI53619.2021.9550791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRAI53619.2021.9550791","startPage":"456","endPage":"462","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (PRAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550757/9550789/09550791.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (PRAI)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combined Data-Driven Method for Electricity Theft Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Combined Data-Driven Method for Electricity Theft Identification","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"20 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550791/","accessionNumber":"21202568","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550791/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combined Data-Driven Method for Electricity Theft Identification","confLoc":"Yibin, China","sourcePdf":"PRAI21-IEEE-ART090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102682S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550757","isNumber":"9550789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550757","xplore-issue":"9550789","articleId":"9550791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9550793,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088866595"},{"name":"Qinyuan Huang","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China"],"firstName":"Qinyuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088867805"},{"name":"Ying Zhou","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37088867615"},{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37088868775"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1322-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1323-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9550793","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550793","abstract":"Arc magnet is an essential part of a permanent magnet motor. It is a critical task to detect the internal defects of the arc magnet before installation and use. At present, this task is mainly completed by experienced workers in the industry, exposing the drawbacks of low efficiency and high cost. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) detection method that combines batch normalization (BN) and global average pooling (GAP) in response to the detection requirements of the internal defects of the arc magnet. The model uses BN processing on the input data of the convolutional layer to speed up the network convergence speed while preventing overfitting and increasing the generalization ability of the model. GAP replaces the fully connected layer in the traditional convolution model, significantly reducing model calculation parameters by reducing feature values. Through the training of the original time-domain signal, the model can complete the intelligent diagnosis of the internal defects of the arc magnet with its powerful ability to extract features automatically. The experimental results show that the proposed method has high recognition accuracy for different types of arc magnets.","doi":"10.1109/PRAI53619.2021.9550793","startPage":"102","endPage":"107","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (PRAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550757/9550789/09550793.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (PRAI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRAI53619.2021.9550793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for Detecting Internal Defects of Arc Magnets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Convolution","Signal processing algorithms","Feature extraction","Permanent magnet motors","Data models","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","convergence","convolutional neural nets","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","electrical engineering computing","feature extraction","flaw detection","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","permanent magnet motors","permanent magnets","time-domain analysis","vibrational signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network convergence speed","acoustic vibration signal excitation","feature extraction","intelligent internal defect diagnosis","time-domain signal","feature value reduction","generalization ability","convolutional layer input data","detection requirements","global average pooling","batch normalization","CNN","convolutional neural network detection method","permanent magnet motor","arc magnet","internal defect detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["arc magnet","defect detection","deep learning","convolutional neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for Detecting Internal Defects of Arc Magnets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550793/","publicationDate":"20 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21202560","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701330"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012774","fundingName":"Innovation Fund of Postgraduate","grantNumber":"y2021084,y2021063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for Detecting Internal Defects of Arc Magnets","confLoc":"Yibin, China","sourcePdf":"PRAI21-IEEE-ART027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072021S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550757","isNumber":"9550789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550757","xplore-issue":"9550789","articleId":"9550793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9550803,"authors":[{"name":"Yuling Yi","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yuling","lastName":"Yi","id":"37088984587"},{"name":"Yunbo Rao","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yunbo","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085992116"},{"name":"Cheng Huang","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088984195"},{"name":"Shaoning Zeng","affiliation":["Yangtze Delta Region Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Huzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shaoning","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37088982949"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Sichuan Institute of Computer Sciences, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088987489"},{"name":"Qixue He","affiliation":["Chengdu Information Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Co.,Ltd, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qixue","lastName":"He","id":"37088981477"},{"name":"Xiaofei Chen","affiliation":["China Tobacco Henan Industrial Co.

The virus enters the human body through exposed areas such as the mouth, nose and eyes through touching, coughing, sneezing or close proximity with infected people. So it is imperative people cover specific body parts to avoid contracting the disease and stop the transmission of the virus. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as face mask, face shield, gloves help in this cause. Unfortunately some people are reluctant to wear PPE. In such situations a real-time monitoring system for PPE is needed. In this study we have developed a detector which can detect in real time if people are wearing PPE or not. The detector is developed using YOLOv4 computer vision model which specially performs well in real time object detection. We have prepared a combined dataset consisting of collected images and our captured images. We have annotated our images and image augmentation is done on all the training set images. We have also converted the detector weight to TensorFlow format to check live detection performance and added features like live object count and record keeping.

First, we confirmed the cell-to-cell interference according to each pattern. As a result, EEP pattern had more interference than the PEE pattern, because the PEE pattern was affected by the BL bias. It leads to conduction energy distortion of the selected cell, which was more severe at EEP pattern. Second, with scaling, conduction energy decreases, and it leads to more severe the interference issue. Finally, to solve this problem, asymmetric read bias was proposed, and it was confirmed that the pattern dependence of the cell-to-cell interference can be reduced. Compared with the conventional, the proposed read scheme reduces the difference in Vth shift value from 0.11V to 0.07V.Therefore, the proposed read scheme is expected to alleviate cell-to-cell interference in the scaling structure of the 3D NAND flash memory.","doi":"10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550809","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550759/9550761/09550809.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric Read Bias for Alleviating Cell-to-Cell Interference in 3D NAND Flash Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550809/","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Read Bias for Alleviating Cell-to-Cell Interference in 3D NAND Flash Memory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550809/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Read Bias for Alleviating Cell-to-Cell Interference in 3D NAND Flash Memory","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570729744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047476S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9550819,"authors":[{"name":"Areeba Jamil","affiliation":["International Islamic University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Areeba","lastName":"Jamil","id":"37088983425"},{"name":"Abu ul Hassan S.

The socio-economic impacts of the pandemic through quantitative analysis of stock market index, currency inflation, gasoline prices, interest rate, consumer price index and crude oil prices were also investigated. With correlation index matrix and heatmaps, we discovered the nature and intensity of interdependency of these features and developed the regressive estimation model to forecast the values of inter-related features for 10 days. We observed a highest correlation of +0.95 between recovery rate and total infected cases. We also observed an inverse correlation of -0.81 between daily new cases and recovery rate due to unexpected rise in outbreak. Also, the mild but positive index for economic impacts, such as currency inflation, depict the virus\u2019 adverse impact on the fiscal situation.

But the accuracy and consistency of CTG are generally not ideal as the correct interpretation is affected by the doctor's clinical experience and ability.

Weather forecast plays important role in predicting natural calamities, agricultural sectors, some industrial sectors, etc. Heat index is a vital part of weather which depends on some weather parameters. Human body temperature, evaporation, etc. depends on heat index. Previously, several researchers worked on this issue to determine whether it rains or not for two to three days. Some of them worked just to determine the effect of change of heat index in different regions. A number of works were based on machine learning algorithms and most of them had either low accuracy or high error rate. But in this paper, we proposed a combined deep learning model. It can predict five most important weather parameters up to 30 days with very low error rate by using single cell long short term memory (LSTM). Along with this, the output from LSTM was further used to predict heat index using artificial neural network (ANN) which also gave a very high accuracy. The dataset provided to the model was pre-processed properly by using Gaussian filter, Median filter and scaling. It increased the sensitivity and performance of the model. We got the mean absolute percentage error rate (MAPE) ranging from 0.02%-8.53% with LSTM model and 94.68% of accuracy from ANN model. Further judging parameters of ANN are precision (94.57%), recall (94.57%), f1 score (94.57%), loss (12.75%). The other error rates of LSTM model are MSE (1%-16%), RMSE (10.72%-39.44%), R2 (99%-100%), MAE (8.17%-34.59%).","doi":"10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550852","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550761","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550759/9550761/09550852.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weather Parameters and Heat Index Prediction Applying Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550852/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Weather Parameters and Heat Index Prediction Applying Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550852/","accessionNumber":"21202352","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weather Parameters and Heat Index Prediction Applying Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570725765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063668S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9550874,"authors":[{"name":"Asif Mahbub Uddin","affiliation":["Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology, Chattogram, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Asif Mahbub","lastName":"Uddin","id":"37088986368"},{"name":"Abdullah Al Miraj","affiliation":["Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology, Chattogram, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Al Miraj","id":"37088984533"},{"name":"Moumita Sen Sarma","affiliation":["Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology, Chattogram, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Moumita","lastName":"Sen Sarma","id":"37088981731"},{"name":"Avishek Das","affiliation":["Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology, Chattogram, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Avishek","lastName":"Das","id":"37088981522"},{"name":"Md.

However, researchers have barely scratched the superficials of food image classification till now. To evaluate the dietary aptitudes of people from various ethnicities, the classification of their traditional foods makes a huge impact. That\u2019s what steered us into the classification of seven traditional foods in Bangladesh. In this regard, our key contribution to this aspect is the development of a dataset of Traditional Bengali Food Image (TBFI) including images of seven different classes of traditional Bengali foods: Biriyani, Panta Ilish, Khichuri, Fuchka, Roshogolla, Dim Vuna & Kala Vuna. For this, a scratch model incorporating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been developed, rectifying to another vital contribution. As conventional Neural Network doesn\u2019t perform well in case of image datasets, the CNN approach has been followed in view of its high accuracy, computational power with efficiency and automatic recognition of important features without any human oversight.

study, we have introduced a method for utilizing the maximum parking space available for a metropolitan city. This will result in much lesser traffic congestion due to street-side parking. Furthermore, it will also decrease the hassle drivers face when they have to leave their vehicles on the side of the road to do other activities. The method introduces a Deep Learning based system where parking spaces are detected using Data Capturing Units (DCU). These DCUs feed data into our database which can be accessed by the users from our mobile application. The users can book parking spaces accordingly. All these data are saved in real-time and can be accessed through the mobile application. A vehicle classification system has also been designed that achieves an accuracy of 77% from multiple vehicle classes. Furthermore, a number plate recognition system has been used for the identification and safety protocols of the vehicles in parking sites. The number plate identification system is very precise and achieves an accuracy of over 90% for each digit. To the best of our knowledge, no other system of this kind has been implemented for the city of Dhaka before this. On top of that, successful implementation in a hectic city like Dhaka implies that it can be applied anywhere in the world. We believe this system can have a huge impact in reducing traffic congestions and can save an endless measure of time and money for citizens in a metropolitan area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550904/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21202396","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning based Smart Parking for a Metropolitan Area","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning based Smart Parking for a Metropolitan Area","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570726510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078338S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9550911,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Omollo Nyangaresi","affiliation":["Tom Mboya University College, Kenya"],"firstName":"Vincent Omollo","lastName":"Nyangaresi","id":"37088552595"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4437-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4438-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"9550911","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECC Based Authentication Scheme for Smart Homes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550911","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Industries","Privacy","Protocols","Simulation","Authentication","Smart homes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Authentication","ECC","ephemerals","smart homes","security attacks"]}],"abstract":"Smart homes security has attracted a lot of attention from both the industry and academia, leading to the development of numerous schemes for both key management and authentication. However, most of these schemes are either inefficient due to both high communication and computational costs, or do not fully offer the required levels of both privacy and security. To address some of these issues, this paper proposed elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) based lightweight key management and mutual authentication protocol for the smart home environment. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol was accomplished using communication costs, computation overheads, throughput and end-to-end- delays (EED). On the other hand, widely applied Dolev\u2013Yao and Canetti-Krawczyk models were deployed for security evaluation of the proposed protocol. The simulation results showed that this protocol exhibited the least communication and computation overheads, and had the least impact on both throughput and EED compared with related schemes. Moreover, it was robust against conventional smart home attacks such as replay, forgery, impersonation and man-in-the middle (MitM) attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ELMAR52657.2021.9550911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR52657.2021.9550911","publicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium ELMAR","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium ELMAR","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550758/9550763/09550911.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"ECC Based Authentication Scheme for Smart Homes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550911/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECC Based Authentication Scheme for Smart Homes","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"002_orig-research.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.173191S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550758","isNumber":"9550763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550758","xplore-issue":"9550763","articleId":"9550911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9550912,"authors":[{"name":"Ankita Tiwari","affiliation":["IIT Guwahati, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Ankita","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37088986204"},{"name":"Gaurav Trivedi","affiliation":["IIT Guwahati, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37698823600"},{"name":"Prithwijit Guha","affiliation":["IIT Guwahati, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Prithwijit","lastName":"Guha","id":"37548863500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0026-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0027-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6102"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-821X"}],"articleNumber":"9550912","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Power demand","Quantization (signal)","Machine learning algorithms","Neural networks","Distance measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bfloat16","DNN","Pipelined MAC","Floating-point MAC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550912","abstract":"Evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and advances in semiconductor technology has enabled us to design many complex systems ranging from IoT based applications to high performance compute engines. AI incorporates various application driven machine learning algorithms, in which floating point numbers are employed for the training of neural network models. However, few simpler number systems, such as fixed-point and integers, are employed in inference due to their smaller bit-width, which reduce area and power consumption at the cost of accuracy due to quantization. The usage of floating point MAC improves the accuracy, but it results in a larger area and more power consumption. In this paper, an area and power efficient pipelined Bfloat16 MAC is proposed aiming performance improvement of neural network applications. The proposed unit is able to handle overflow, underflow, and normalization efficiently. Additionally, computational accuracy of MAC is improved by increasing mantissa bit-width and by eliminating normalization in the intermediate stages. The proposed non-pipelined MAC utilizes 18.61% less resources as compared to similar architectures. The area and power of the proposed 16-bit nonpipelined Bfloat16 MAC is reduced by 5.21% and 32%, respectively, at 200 MHz as compared to another 16-bit nonpipelined Bfloat16 MAC reported in [26]. The area and power of our proposed MAC is improved by 38.6% and 93% at 200 MHz, and 7.1% and 11.52% at 01 GHz, when it is compared with a 16-bit pipelined posit MAC and a pipelined Bfloat16 MAC reported in [27], respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550912","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550759/9550761/09550912.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Low Power Bfloat16 Pipelined MAC Unit for Deep Neural Network Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Low Power Bfloat16 Pipelined MAC Unit for Deep Neural Network Applications","htmlLink":"/document/9550912/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Low Power Bfloat16 Pipelined MAC Unit for Deep Neural Network Applications","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570726539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066433S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9550913,"authors":[{"name":"Subhasish Goswami","affiliation":["Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Subhasish","lastName":"Goswami","id":"37088689582"},{"name":"Rabijit Singh","affiliation":["Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Rabijit","lastName":"Singh","id":"37088983914"},{"name":"Nayanjeet Saikia","affiliation":["Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Nayanjeet","lastName":"Saikia","id":"37088984455"},{"name":"Kaushik Kumar Bora","affiliation":["Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Kaushik Kumar","lastName":"Bora","id":"37088981026"},{"name":"Utpal Sharma","affiliation":["Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Utpal","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38014337800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0026-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0027-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6102"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-821X"}],"articleNumber":"9550913","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Industries","Smart contracts","Neural networks","Memory architecture","Tools","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contracts","cryptocurrencies","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbolic tools","Ethereum mainnet","sequential data","smart contract opcodes","long short-term memory neural network architecture","cryptocurrencies","vulnerable path detection","blockchain applications","deep learning based security vulnerability detection","TokenCheck","ERC-20 token smart contracts","scalable security vulnerability detection tool","efficient security vulnerability detection tool","symbolic analysis tools","security vulnerabilities","token source codes","Ethereum based tokens","ERC-20 tokens"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ERC-20 Tokens","Machine Learning","Security Vulnerability Detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550913","abstract":"The use of Ethereum based tokens in blockchain applications have been on the rise in recent times and accordingly, the need for proper analysis of token source codes for security vulnerabilities has become paramount. Existing symbolic analysis tools have demonstrated to be efficient in detecting many of the security vulnerabilities, but by virtue of the complex nature of the analysis they perform to detect vulnerable paths, there is a considerable increase in search time with an increase in depth. Cryptocurrencies have recently achieved the milestone of a USD 2 trillion market cap and with such a high volume of assets involved, the need for an efficient and scalable security vulnerability detection tool in an ever-increasing list of tokens becomes of utmost priority. This paper proposes a deep learning based approach for the prediction of security vulnerabilities in ERC-20 token smart contracts. The proposal proposed by this paper is based on the use of Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture on smart contract opcodes which are in form of sequential data. The proposed solution achieves an accuracy of 93.26% when tested on ERC-20 smart contracts collected from Ethereum mainnet and thus proves to be an efficient alternative for existing symbolic tools.","doi":"10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550913","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550759/9550761/09550913.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TokenCheck: Towards Deep Learning Based Security Vulnerability Detection In ERC-20 Tokens","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"TokenCheck: Towards Deep Learning Based Security Vulnerability Detection In ERC-20 Tokens","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550913/","accessionNumber":"21202303","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550913/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TokenCheck: Towards Deep Learning Based Security Vulnerability Detection In ERC-20 Tokens","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570726406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081474S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9550936,"authors":[{"name":"Marin Ben\u010devi\u0107","affiliation":["Osijek Kneza, Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Marin","lastName":"Ben\u010devi\u0107","id":"37088982202"},{"name":"Marija Habijan","affiliation":["Osijek Kneza, Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Marija","lastName":"Habijan","id":"37086932283"},{"name":"Irena Gali\u0107","affiliation":["Osijek Kneza, Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Irena","lastName":"Gali\u0107","id":"38492977600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4437-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4438-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"9550936","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Computed tomography","Neural networks","Semantics","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","cardiovascular system","computerised tomography","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","diseases","image segmentation","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["epicardial adipose tissue segmentation","CT images","cardiovascular disease risk factor","CT scans","semi3D neural network","heart wall","pericardium","disease risk assessment","deep neural network","U-Net-based architecture","image augmentation","Dice score"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cardiovascular imaging","Deep neural networks","Epicardial adipose tissue","Medical image processing","Semantic segmentation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550936","abstract":"Epicardial adipose tissue is a type of adipose tissue located between the heart wall and a protective layer around the heart called the pericardium. The volume and thickness of epicardial adipose tissue are linked to various cardiovascular diseases. It is shown to be an independent cardiovascular disease risk factor.

This paper proposes a method for fully automatic semantic segmentation of epicardial adipose tissue from CT images using a deep neural network. The proposed network uses a U-Net-based architecture with slice depth information embedded in the input image to segment a pericardium region of interest, which is used to obtain an epicardial adipose tissue segmentation. Image augmentation is used to increase model robustness. Cross-validation of the proposed method yields a Dice score of 0.86 on the CT scans of 20 patients.","doi":"10.1109/ELMAR52657.2021.9550936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR52657.2021.9550936","startPage":"87","endPage":"90","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium ELMAR","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550758/9550763/09550936.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium ELMAR","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Epicardial Adipose Tissue Segmentation from CT Images with A Semi-3D Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Epicardial Adipose Tissue Segmentation from CT Images with A Semi-3D Neural Network","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550936/","accessionNumber":"21202617","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550936/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epicardial Adipose Tissue Segmentation from CT Images with A Semi-3D Neural Network","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"018_orig-research.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077858S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550758","isNumber":"9550763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550758","xplore-issue":"9550763","articleId":"9550936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9550946,"authors":[{"name":"Alen Duspara","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Alen","lastName":"Duspara","id":"37086012864"},{"name":"Mario Kova\u010d","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Kova\u010d","id":"37268279400"},{"name":"Hrvoje Mlinari\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Hrvoje","lastName":"Mlinari\u0107","id":"37293965000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4437-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4438-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"9550946","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete Cosine Transform Hardware Accelerator in Parallel Ultra-low Power System","abstract":"In this paper, the architecture of a fully pipelined discrete cosine transform ( DCT) hardware accelerator for a JPEG encoder is proposed.

The idea to offload a computationally intensive task to cloud has been extensively researched since the last decade. These are generally aimed at optimizing system energy consumption or latency reduction. In this paper we attempt to examine the profitability of computation offloading from the perspective of a network operator. The offloading decisions and joint optimization of radio and computational resources result in a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem which is NP hard. To tackle this challenge, we decouple the offloading decisions from the radio and computational resource allocation. Firstly, the offloading decision is arrived at using a heuristic based genetic algorithm. It then goes as input to resource allocation optimization problem. The proposed genetic algorithm outperforms spectrum efficiency based offloading algorithm as per the simulations performed.","doi":"10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550947","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550759/9550761/09550947.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Profit Optimization for Mobile Edge Computing using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550947/","displayDocTitle":"Profit Optimization for Mobile Edge Computing using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550947/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Profit Optimization for Mobile Edge Computing using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570728037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089447S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9550977,"authors":[{"name":"Samiul Haque","affiliation":["Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University, Dinajpur, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Samiul","lastName":"Haque","id":"37088982954"},{"name":"Mohammad Akidul Hoque","affiliation":["Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University, Dinajpur, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mohammad Akidul","lastName":"Hoque","id":"37088985899"},{"name":"Mohammad Ariful Islam Khan","affiliation":["Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University, Dinajpur, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mohammad Ariful Islam","lastName":"Khan","id":"37088982635"},{"name":"Sabbir Ahmed","affiliation":["Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University, Dinajpur, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Sabbir","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37088986443"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0026-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0027-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6102"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-821X"}],"articleNumber":"9550977","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Training","Supervised learning","Machine learning","Semisupervised learning","Feature extraction","Reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-Supervised Learning","COVID-19 Diagnosis","Chest X-Ray Classification"]}],"abstract":"The world has experienced the very first pandemic of 21st century, called the COVID-19 which is caused by a deadly virus named Coronavirus. In this regard, one of the very first strategy to minimize the number of affected patients and reduce casualties is to diagnose COVID-19 at an early stage. Currently, PCR test is primarily utilized for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, PCR test requires a huge number of expensive test kits as well as trained experts. Therefore, chest X-Ray imaging technique (including Machine Learning) has been considered as an alternative for COVID-19 diagnosis among the researchers. This particular method is faster, less expensive and will allow the authorities to manage the COVID19 diagnosis system in a cost-effective way. Machine learning techniques have been proven to be significantly efficient and accurate for image classification problems. On the other hand, One of the most utilized techniques in machine learning is supervised learning which is highly convenient and helping the experts to diagnose and make informed decisions about COVID-19. Supervised learning in image classification requires vast amount of radiography images with notable accuracy which can be a peculiar issue in medical domain. In order to address the problem, we have investigated a distinct approach for COVID-19 Diagnosis with a nominal dataset. In this work, We have studied the effectiveness of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) for COVID-19 diagnosis from chest X-ray images. We have investigated a prepossessing technique by extracting and combining local phase image feature into multi-feature image to train our SSL model in teacher/student archetype. Our study have shown that by using 17.0% of the total dataset for training, the SSL model achieve 93.45% accuracy. We also provide comparative metrics of SSL approach against other fully supervised techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550977","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550759/9550761/09550977.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550761","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"COVID-19 Detection Using Feature Extraction and Semi-Supervised Learning from Chest X-ray Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"COVID-19 Detection Using Feature Extraction and Semi-Supervised Learning from Chest X-ray Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550977/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550977/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"COVID-19 Detection Using Feature Extraction and Semi-Supervised Learning from Chest X-ray Images","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570726541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052147S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9550985,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Han","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Han","id":"37088981212"},{"name":"Jin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088985709"},{"name":"Liu Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088656750"},{"name":"Dengyong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Dengyong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087228014"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0026-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0027-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6102"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-821X"}],"articleNumber":"9550985","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Schedules","Tensors","Machine learning","Parallel processing","Data processing","Market research"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tensor decomposition","Heterogeneous computing","Differential privacy"]}],"abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the Internet of everything connected.

Generally, operations judge whether a web service is stable by monitoring various key performance indicators (KPI). If a KPI is abnormal, it often means that there is a problem with the related application, and KPI anomaly detection plays an important role in it. KPI is time serial which is different from static data. In this article, we show the investigation and summary of KPI anomaly detection. The KPI anomaly detection methods can be classified into three types: distance-based methods, density-based methods, and deep learning-based methods. We conclude the advantages and disadvantages of them. Finally, we give the possible future research directions.","doi":"10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550989","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550759/9550761/09550989.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of Key Performance Indicator Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550989/","displayDocTitle":"Overview of Key Performance Indicator Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9550989/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of Key Performance Indicator Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570713882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080211S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9550994,"authors":[{"name":"Tehreem Syed","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tehreem","lastName":"Syed","id":"37088984560"},{"name":"Vijay Kakani","affiliation":["Integrated System and Engineering, Inha Univeristy, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kakani","id":"37087121873"},{"name":"Xuenan Cui","affiliation":["Information and Communication Engineering, Inha Univeristy, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xuenan","lastName":"Cui","id":"37667222900"},{"name":"Hakil Kim","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hakil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085710568"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0026-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0027-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6102"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-821X"}],"articleNumber":"9550994","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"abstract":"Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) occur with well-known neuromorphic hardware that delivers extra energy compared to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Nevertheless, exploiting the same network layers as conventional ANNs to persevere a task appears unsuitable. Previous works employ similar architectures as Artificial Neural Networks and transform them into Spiking Neural Networks to attain the most exemplary performance as conventional ANNs. Nevertheless, this conversion technique needs greater timesteps for training spiking neural networks (SNNs). In this work, rather than using the ANN to SNN conversion method, we exploit the SNNs training directly using spike-based backpropagation. Since utilizing SNNs with the spike-based backpropagation requires fewer timesteps compared to ANN to SNN transformation approach. This work evaluates the classification performance on public and private (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and KITTI) datasets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiking Neural Networks Using Backpropagation","doi":"10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550994","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550759/9550761/09550994.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENSYMP52854.2021.9550994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550994","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backpropagation","Training","Neuromorphics","Artificial neural networks","Transforms","Hardware","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spiking neural networks","time-steps","processing time","backpropagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spiking Neural Networks Using Backpropagation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9550994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9550994/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiking Neural Networks Using Backpropagation","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1570717778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07014S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550759","isNumber":"9550761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550759","xplore-issue":"9550761","articleId":"9550994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9551000,"authors":[{"name":"Shaik Mohammed Waseem","affiliation":["VLSI Systems Research Group, IIIT Bangalore, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Shaik Mohammed","lastName":"Waseem","id":"37086032184"},{"name":"Alavala Venkata Suraj","affiliation":["VLSI Systems Research Group, IIIT Bangalore, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Alavala","lastName":"Venkata Suraj","id":"37088987409"},{"name":"Subir Kumar Roy","affiliation":["VLSI Systems Research Group, IIIT Bangalore, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Subir Kumar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37086072180"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0026-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0027-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6102"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-821X"}],"articleNumber":"9551000","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Knowledge engineering","Neural networks","Graphics processing units","Logic gates","Hardware","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Activation Function","Field Programmable Gate Array","Hybrid Deep neural networks","Hardware Accelerator"]}],"abstract":"Much of the work in literature about hardware implementations of deep neural networks illustrates the multiplication of input signal with weights and summing up the data.

These adapters measure the harmonic distortion of the signal on a power amplifier designed for a radar transmitter in the S band at frequencies from 2.7 GHz to 2.9 GHz. The transition makes it possible to measure the level of harmonic components up to the third harmonic, i.e. up to an output frequency of 9 GHz off-line.

Behind the amplifier, a power ferrite insulator is inserted in the radar. When measuring harmonics, the insulator facilitates a high-quality impedance termination of the output of the power amplifier. This guarantees the reliable function of this device. The paper describes two solutions of these transitions: on the one hand a transition based on fin-line lines with small reflections in the baseband, and on the other hand a waveguide stepped transition with low reflections in the higher harmonic bands.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR52657.2021.9551003","publicationTitle":"2021

input method for mobile devices. After developing for a long time, the technology of handwritten recognition is becoming more and more mature. However, the task of handwritten mathematical expression recognition is more complicated than general handwriting text recognition task. The large number of mathematical and alphabetic symbols and the complicated two-dimensional spatial structure increase the difficulty of handwritten mathematical expression recognition. In this paper, a system of integrated recognition without using grammar constraints was proposed for solving the problem of online handwritten mathematical expression recognition. In the proposed system, the sequences of features in stroke level are extracted from handwritten mathematical expression in chronological order, then the sequences of features are processed and recognized by the pre-training Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). Compared with the traditional grammar-driven recognition system of handwriting mathematical expression, the proposed system by passes accurate segmentation of mathematical expression sequence and the manual work for defining grammars. Therefore, the proposed system can reduce the time complexity of recognition algorithm of handwritten mathematical expression and improve the efficiency of recognition.","doi":"10.1109/PRAI53619.2021.9551034","pdfPath":"/iel7/9550757/9550789/09551034.pdf","startPage":"446","endPage":"451","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (PRAI)","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (PRAI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRAI53619.2021.9551034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9550789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition System Based on Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Design of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition System Based on Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","accessionNumber":"21202586","publicationDate":"20 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551034/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition System Based on Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Yibin, China","sourcePdf":"PRAI21-IEEE-ART088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074226S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550757","isNumber":"9550789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550757","xplore-issue":"9550789","articleId":"9551034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9551070,"authors":[{"name":"Yanan Lin","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yanan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37088981569"},{"name":"Yan Huang","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088985018"},{"name":"Shihao Zhou","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Shihao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37088982964"},{"name":"Mengxi Jiang","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Mengxi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37088986378"},{"name":"Tianlong Wang","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Tianlong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088986230"},{"name":"Yunqi Lei","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yunqi","lastName":"Lei","id":"37085490260"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1322-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1323-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9551070","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"Since a point cloud might contain large quantities of points in practical scenarios, it is desirable to perform downsampling before point cloud analysis. Classic downsampling strategies, such as farthest point sampling (FPS), tend to sample points regardless of subsequent tasks, which inevitably hampers the effectiveness of sampling results. Moreover, raw point clouds obtained from 3D sensors are usually noisy and unevenly distributed. As a consequence, the downsampling process might be affected seriously. In this paper, we propose a density-adaptive downsampling network (DA-Net) for point cloud classification task. The entire process of DA-Net is conducted in an end-to-end way, ensuring that the sampling operation is differentiable and optimal for downstream applications. One key process of DA-Net is density-adaptive K nearest neighboring (DAKNN), which is proposed to alleviate the adverse effects brought by density variation of point clouds. Another key process is the local adjustment (LA) of initial sampled points, which can further equip our model with noise immunity. Consequently, our network can enhance the effectiveness of sampled points and further improve the task performance. In point cloud classification task, our approach achieves significantly better results over existing downsampling alternatives. Extensive experiments are presented to demonstrate the advantages of our DA-Net.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Sensors","Pattern recognition","Noise

Radiographs have perhaps presented the fastest means of diagnosing COVID-19 in patients. The well-known standard for COVID-19 test requires a standard procedure and usually has low sensitivity. Previous studies have adopted various AI-based methods in detecting COVID-19 using both chest tomography and chest x-ray. In this study, the goal is to propose an enhanced convolutional neural multi-resolution wavelet network for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis. Our proposed model is a convolutional neural network integrated discrete wavelet transform of four level decomposition multiresolution analysis robust to handle few dataset which is very paramount due to the fast emergence of COVID-19. We evaluated our model based on three categories of public dataset of chest x-ray and chest tomography images. Our proposed model achieves 98.5% accuracy, 99.8% sensitivity, 98.2% specificity, and 99.6% AUC for multiple class categories with less training parameters.

First, a Gaussian mixture model clustering method (GMM) is used to extract the active point cloud data of a single person from the data collected by the radar. Then point cloud nearest neighbor sampling algorithm is proposed for processing the radar point cloud data. Eventually, the long and short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to extract the features between time series data frames to realize action recognition. In this paper, a nearest neighbor sampling algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of sparse point cloud in single-person activity in the radar point cloud data processing. This method selects the reflection point closest to the centroid of the current frame based on the Euclidean distance, and merges multiple frames data with behavior information contained through a sliding window to fill in the information of the current frame and enrich the temporal and spatial sequence data. The radar point cloud data collected is then converted to fixed-dimensional feature information to meet the input requirements of the LSTM network. The experimental results show that the action recognition proposed in this paper has an average recognition accuracy of 98.68% for falling, sitting, and walking in a multi-person activity scene.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551097/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"20 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21202537","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FMCW Multi-Person Action Recognition System Based on Point Cloud Nearest Neighbor Sampling Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FMCW Multi-Person Action Recognition System Based on Point Cloud Nearest Neighbor Sampling Algorithm","confLoc":"Yibin, China","sourcePdf":"PRAI21-IEEE-ART030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040222S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9550757","isNumber":"9550789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9550757","xplore-issue":"9550789","articleId":"9551097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9551111,"authors":[{"name":"Giulia Slavic","affiliation":["University of Genova (Italy), University Carlos III de Madrid (Spain)"],"firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Slavic","id":"37088427880"},{"name":"Pablo Marin","affiliation":["University of Genova (Italy), University Carlos III de Madrid (Spain)"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Marin","id":"37086451145"},{"name":"David Martin","affiliation":["University of Genova (Italy), University Carlos III de Madrid (Spain)"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Martin","id":"38252754600"},{"name":"Lucio Marcenaro","affiliation":["University of Genova (Italy), University Carlos III de Madrid (Spain)"],"firstName":"Lucio","lastName":"Marcenaro","id":"37277507700"},{"name":"Carlo Regazzoni","affiliation":["University of Genova (Italy), University Carlos III de Madrid (Spain)"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Regazzoni","id":"37277524500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7289-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7290-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9551111","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Autonomous systems","Conferences","Machine learning","Predictive models","Markov processes","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Kalman Filter","Pamcle Filter","Interpretable Machine Learning"]}],"abstract":"When performing anomaly detection on an autonomous vehicle\u2019s sensory data, it is fundamental to infer the cause of the found anomalies.

Existing methods in the literature usually apply norm-based gradient filters in each iteration and eliminate possible outliers, which can be ineffective in a setting with heterogeneous and unbalanced training data. We propose a heuristic yet novel scheme for adjusting the weights in the gradient aggregation step that accounts for two anomaly metrics, namely the relative distance and the convergence measure. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme brings notable performance gain compared to norm-based policies when the agents have distinct data distributions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly-Aware Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Systems (ICAS)","doi":"10.1109/ICAS49788.2021.9551122","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Systems (ICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551106/9551107/09551122.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAS49788.2021.9551122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly-Aware Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551122/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly-Aware Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07618S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551106","isNumber":"9551107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551106","xplore-issue":"9551107","articleId":"9551122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9551127,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Gao","affiliation":["University of Washington"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Gao","id":"37088353015"},{"name":"Sumit Roy","affiliation":["University of Washington"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Roy","id":"37088354100"},{"name":"Guanbin Xing","affiliation":["University of Washington"],"firstName":"Guanbin","lastName":"Xing","id":"37088353495"},{"name":"Sian Jin","affiliation":["University of Washington"],"firstName":"Sian","lastName":"Jin","id":"37088770451"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7289-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7290-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9551127","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Meteorological radar","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Spaceborne radar","Snow","Radar","Radar imaging","Millimeter wave radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mmWave","FMCW","2D MIMO","DoA","non-uniform array","robustness","adverse weather"]}],"abstract":"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are being increasingly integrated in commercial vehicles to support new Adaptive Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) features that require accurate location and Doppler velocity estimates of objects, independent of environmental conditions.

To operate at the highest performance level, the allocation and vacation process of primary and secondary users need to be accomplished rapidly. This issue motivates us to propose a fast machine learning-based processing algorithm, referred to as the Arithmetic Shifter-Based Support Vector Machine (ASB-SVM) classifier. The novelty of our proposed scheme is to increase the speed of signal classification by employing shift registers in a two multipliers feature mapping method instead of using multiplication blocks in the SVM classifier. The proposed ASB-SVM design is implemented in Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T FPGA. By exploiting spectral features for the classifier, an overall accuracy rate of 98:2% is achieved for green modulated signals in CRNs. Experimental results show that given the feature vector, our proposed system is capable of classifying a blind modulated signal within just 3 ns in the classifier block of a CRN while achieving 30% resource reduction and 45% increase in speed compared to the conventional linear SVM implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Systems (ICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551106/9551107/09551139.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Systems (ICAS)","doi":"10.1109/ICAS49788.2021.9551139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAS49788.2021.9551139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Machine Learning-Based Signal Classification in Energy Constrained CRN: FPGA Design and Implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Machine learning algorithms","Autonomous systems","Wireless networks","Pattern classification","Modulation","Shift registers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Primary User Signal Detection","Machine Learning","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fast Machine Learning-Based Signal Classification in Energy Constrained CRN: FPGA Design and Implementation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551139/","publicationDate":"11 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Machine Learning-Based Signal Classification in Energy Constrained CRN: FPGA Design and Implementation","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078673S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551106","isNumber":"9551107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551106","xplore-issue":"9551107","articleId":"9551139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9551160,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Li","affiliation":["Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering (CIISE), Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, Canada","school of computer, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, China","Global Artificial Intelligence Accelerator (GAIA) innovation hub, Ericsson INC, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Li","id":"37088583760"},{"name":"Jie Gao","affiliation":["Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering (CIISE), Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, Canada","Global Artificial Intelligence Accelerator (GAIA) innovation hub, Ericsson INC, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086456564"},{"name":"Chun Wang","affiliation":["Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering (CIISE), Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538404700"},{"name":"Xiao Huang","affiliation":["Concordia John Molson School of Business (JMSB), Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088580576"},{"name":"Yimin Nie","affiliation":["Global Artificial Intelligence Accelerator (GAIA) innovation hub, Ericsson INC, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Yimin","lastName":"Nie","id":"37088880141"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7289-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7290-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9551160","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"abstract":"In this paper, we study a one-to-one matching ride-sharing problem to save the travellers\u2019 total travel time considering travel time uncertainty. Unlike the existing work where the uncertainty set is assumed to be known or roughly estimated, in this work, we propose a learning-based robust optimization framework to handle the issue properly. Specifically, we assume the travel time varies in an uncertainty set which is predicted by a machine learning approach- ARIMA using travel time historical data, the predicted uncertainty set then serves as the input parameter for the robust optimization model. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct a group of numerical experiments based on New York taxi trip record data sets. The results show that our proposed data-driven robust optimization approach outperforms the robust optimization model with a given uncertainty set in terms of total travel time savings. Further, the proposed approach can improve the travel time savings up to 112.8%, and 34% by average. Most importantly, our proposed approach is capable of handling the uncertainty in a more effective way when the uncertainty degrees become high.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Autonomous systems","Conferences","Machine learning","Predictive models","Dispatching","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","traffic engineering computing","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARIMA","travel time historical data","learning-based robust optimization framework","travellers","matching ride-sharing problem","travel time uncertainty","ride-sharing platform","total travel time savings","data-driven robust optimization approach","New York taxi trip record data sets","robust optimization model","predicted uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-Driven optimization","Robust optimization","Ride-Sharing","Travel Time Savings"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAS49788.2021.9551160","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Systems (ICAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Systems (ICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551106/9551107/09551160.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAS49788.2021.9551160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Order Dispatching in Ride-Sharing Platform under Travel Time Uncertainty: A Data-Driven Robust Optimization Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Order Dispatching in Ride-Sharing Platform under Travel Time Uncertainty: A Data-Driven Robust Optimization Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551160/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551160/","accessionNumber":"21201466","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Order Dispatching in Ride-Sharing Platform under Travel Time Uncertainty: A Data-Driven Robust Optimization Approach","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.225006S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551106","isNumber":"9551107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551106","xplore-issue":"9551107","articleId":"9551160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9551164,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Schultz","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Schultz","id":"37903837400"},{"name":"Anshu Saksena","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD"],"firstName":"Anshu","lastName":"Saksena","id":"37563474600"},{"name":"Elizabeth P.

When the system dynamics and observations can be modeled together as a fully known linear Gaussian state space (SS) model, the celebrated Kalman filter (KF) is a low complexity optimal solution. However, both linearity of the underlying SS model and accurate knowledge of it are often not encountered in practice. This work proposes to estimate the velocity using a hybrid data-driven (DD) implementation of the KF for non-linear systems, coined KalmanNet. KalmanNet integrates a compact recurrent neural network in the flow of the classical KF, retaining low computational complexity, high data efficiency, and interpretability, while enabling operation in non-linear SS models with partial information. We apply KalmanNet on an autonomous racing car as part of the Formula Student (FS) Driverless competition. Our results demonstrate the ability of KalmanNet to outperform a state-of-the-art implementation of the KF that uses a postulated SS model, while being applicable on the vehicle control unit used by the car.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551175/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21201518","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Kalman-Based Velocity Estimation for Autonomous Racing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Kalman-Based Velocity Estimation for Autonomous Racing","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072694S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551106","isNumber":"9551107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551106","xplore-issue":"9551107","articleId":"9551175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9551183,"authors":[{"name":"Ambareesh Ravi","affiliation":["CPAMI, University of Waterloo, ON, CANADA"],"firstName":"Ambareesh","lastName":"Ravi","id":"37088986406"},{"name":"Fakhri Karray","affiliation":["CPAMI, University of Waterloo, ON, CANADA"],"firstName":"Fakhri","lastName":"Karray","id":"37275052800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7289-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7290-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9551183","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Computer vision","Conferences","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Benchmark testing","Cognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperparameter tuning","automated semisupervised visual anomaly detection tasks","autoencoder architecture","model-agnostic improvement","hyper-parameter tuning","optimal design","computer vision","visual data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional AutoEncoders","Anomaly Detection","Attention"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551183","abstract":"Understanding the notion of normality in visual data is a complex issue in computer vision with plenty of potential applications in several sectors. The immense effort required for optimal design for real-world application of existing methods warrants the need for a generic framework that is efficient, automated and can be momentarily deployed for the operation, reducing the effort expended on model design and hyper-parameter tuning. Hence, we propose a novel, modular and model-agnostic improvement to the conventional AutoEncoder architecture, based on visual soft-attention for the inputs to make them robust and readily improve their performance in automated semi-supervised visual anomaly detection tasks, without any extra effort in terms of hyperparameter tuning. Besides, we discuss the role of attention in AutoEncoders (AE) that can significantly improve learning and the efficacy of the models with detailed experimental results on diverse visual anomaly detection datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICAS49788.2021.9551183","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Systems (ICAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAS49788.2021.9551183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551107","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Systems (ICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551106/9551107/09551183.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attentive Autoencoders For Improving Visual Anomaly Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551183/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Attentive Autoencoders For Improving Visual Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551183/","accessionNumber":"21201521","publicationDate":"11 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attentive Autoencoders For Improving Visual Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049802S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551106","isNumber":"9551107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551106","xplore-issue":"9551107","articleId":"9551183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9551204,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Hang Hsieh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","MediaTek Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9551204/hsieh-3116044-small.gif","p":["Ming-Hang Hsieh received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2018, and the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2020.

To this end, this paper proposes a compact 4-bit number format (SD4) for neural network weights. In addition to significantly reducing the amount of neural network data transmission, SD4 also reduces the neural network convolution operation from multiplication and addition (MAC) to only addition. MNIST and CIFAR-10 CNNs with SD4 weights achieve results similar to their FP32-trained counterparts. The difference between the top-1 accuracy of 4-bit ResNet CNN for ImageNet and the baseline FP32 CNN is less than 0.5%.

Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) is a complex decision-making process where the output power of the entire power generating units must be set in a way that results in the overall economic operation of the power system. Moreover, it is a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Now a days, there is a tendency to use metaheuristic methods to deal with the complexity of the ELD problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a subclass of metaheuristic methods inspired by fish schooling and bird flocking behaviors. However, the optimization performance of the PSO is highly dependent on fitness landscapes and can lead to local optima stagnation and premature convergence. Therefore, in the proposed study, two new variants of the PSO called global particle swarm optimizer with inertial weights (GPSO-w) and quasi-oppositional population based global particle swarm optimizer with inertial weights (QPGPSO-w) are proposed to address the complexity of the ELD problem. The ELD problem is formulated as an optimization problem and validation of the proposed methods is performed on IEEE standards (3, 6, 13, 15, 40 & 140) unit Korean grid ELD test systems under numerous constraints and the obtained results are compared with the several recent techniques presented in the literature. The results obtained with convex systems showed excellent cost-effectiveness, while for non-convex systems sequential quadratic programming (SQP) optimizer was added to discover global minima even more efficiently. The proposed techniques were successful in solving the ELD problem and yielded better results compared to the reported results in the selected cases. It is further inferred that the proposed techniques with less algorithmic parameters reflected improved exploration and convergence characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116066","startPage":"134081","endPage":"134095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09551205.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi Oppositional Population Based Global Particle Swarm Optimizer With Inertial Weights (QPGPSO-W) for Solving Economic Load Dispatch Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551205/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quasi Oppositional Population Based Global Particle Swarm Optimizer With Inertial Weights (QPGPSO-W) for Solving Economic Load Dispatch Problem","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9551205/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21103652","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Quasi Oppositional Population Based Global Particle Swarm Optimizer With Inertial Weights (QPGPSO-W) for Solving Economic Load Dispatch Problem","sourcePdf":"access-menhas-3116066-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165089S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9551205","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9551206,"authors":[{"name":"Albashir Adel Youssef","affiliation":["Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Giza, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9551206/youss-3116081-small.gif","p":["Albashir Adel Youssef (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics and communications engineering from Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (AASTMT), Egypt, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2019.

This is due to its high data rate, unlicensed spectrum, low cost, and immense security for FSO systems. Due to these advantages, FSO can have broader applications that extend from terrestrial to satellite communication. Atmospheric turbulence (AT) induced fading is a primary problem in the FSO link since it significantly impairs its performance. Atmospheric turbulence occurs due to the random variation of the air refractive index with time. Several statistical models are introduced to characterize the AT. The Log-normal (LN) model represents weak and moderate turbulence, and the Gamma-Gamma (G-G) model is employed for strong turbulence. These models are used with the effect of weather attenuation, geometric losses, and misalignment errors. One possible solution is channel coding, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. This paper proposed employing Weighted Bit Flipping (WBF) and Implementation Efficient Reliability Ratio Weighted Bit Flipping (IERRWBF) decoding techniques to improve FSO link performance. The results show a superior improvement in the bit error rate (BER) than the uncoded FSO system. In addition, the obtained results prove that the IERRWBF technique is more optimized than WBF from the point of the number of iterations, especially in weak and moderate turbulence FSO channels.

One of the challenges in planning for operations when dealing with wind farms is to account for the fact that wind power is not dispatchable, and forecasting of wind over a typical window of operational planning such as a 7-day long horizon is challenging. While most previous reports on forecasting wind power are focused on short term wind forecast, this study focuses on ultra-long term forecast of generation in wind farms by using physical models in combination with deep learning as a rapidly growing part of machine learning discipline. The proposed approach is compared against a traditional approach of wind power forecast using physical models and provides promising improvement in accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/icSmartGrid52357.2021.9551245","startPage":"174","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Smart Grid (icSmartGrid)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icSmartGrid52357.2021.9551245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551022","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Smart Grid (icSmartGrid)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551202/9551022/09551245.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra long-Term Wind Farm Generation Forecast by Combining Numerical Weather Prediction with Gated Recurrent Units","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551245/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ultra long-Term Wind Farm Generation Forecast by Combining Numerical Weather Prediction with Gated Recurrent Units","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551245/","accessionNumber":"21201764","publicationDate":"29 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2021-July 1 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra long-Term Wind Farm Generation Forecast by Combining Numerical Weather Prediction with Gated Recurrent Units","confLoc":"Setubal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"47-Penfield-UltraLong-Canada.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052241S","chronDate":"June 29 2021-July 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551202","isNumber":"9551022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551202","xplore-issue":"9551022","articleId":"9551245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9551251,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Yaichi","affiliation":["Ahmed Draya University, Adrar, Algeria"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Yaichi","id":"37086128254"},{"name":"Abdelkader Harrouz","affiliation":["Laboratoire de D\u00e9veloppement Durable et Informatique LDDI, Ahmed Draya University, Adrar, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdelkader","lastName":"Harrouz","id":"38667823200"},{"name":"Ibrahim Boussaid","affiliation":["Laboratoire de D\u00e9veloppement Durable et Informatique LDDI, Ahmed Draya University, Adrar, Algeria"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Boussaid","id":"37088984409"},{"name":"Abdelhafid Semmah","affiliation":["ICEPS laboratory, Djillali Liabes University, Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdelhafid","lastName":"Semmah","id":"37086132264"},{"name":"Patrice Wira","affiliation":["IRIMAS laboratory, University of Haute Alsace, Mulhouse, France"],"firstName":"Patrice","lastName":"Wira","id":"37293976200"},{"name":"Ilhami Colak","affiliation":["Engineering Architecture Faculty, Electrical Electronics Engineering, Nisantasi University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ilhami","lastName":"Colak","id":"37389438300"},{"name":"Korhan Kayisli","affiliation":["Eng.

The objective is to control the torque and rotor flux of the DFIG directly through the inverters. Conventional DTC control (C-DTC) has the problem of a harmonic rate for the currents generated by the DFIG, because of the variable switching frequency. To remedy this problem, an Artificial Neural Network DTC (ANN-DTC) strategy is proposed. The proposed ANN-DTC technique reduces torque and flux ripples. In this command, the torque and rotor flux are regulated by a neural network type regulator, and the switching table and the hysteresis correctors have been eliminated. In order to better illustrate the effect of the C-DTC and ANN-DTC control on the signal quality provided by the DFIG, a spectral analysis of the stator and rotor currents has been carried out. Simulation results of the proposed controllers are compared for various step changes in the torque and rotor flux. The simulation results of the proposed ANN-DTC scheme are fully verified by using Matlab/Simulink.","doi":"10.1109/icSmartGrid52357.2021.9551251","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551202/9551022/09551251.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"237","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Smart Grid (icSmartGrid)","publicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Smart Grid (icSmartGrid)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icSmartGrid52357.2021.9551251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved DTC Strategy for a DFIG using an Artificial Neural Network Controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2021-July 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Improved DTC Strategy for a DFIG using an Artificial Neural Network Controller","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","accessionNumber":"21201772","publicationDate":"29 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551251/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved DTC Strategy for a DFIG using an Artificial Neural Network Controller","confLoc":"Setubal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"81-Yaichi-AnImproved-Algeria.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064785S","chronDate":"June 29 2021-July 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551202","isNumber":"9551022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551202","xplore-issue":"9551022","articleId":"9551251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9551268,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Cheng","affiliation":["School of Optical-electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/9594098/9551268/cheng-3116060-small.gif","p":["Lei Cheng was born in Anhui, China, in 1995.

In order to improve the measurement result, a SAW sensor demodulation method by combining hybrid changing area niche genetic algorithm and MUSIC algorithm was proposed. The proposed method was based on the MUSIC algorithm to construct the power spectrum function of SAW echo signal. A hybrid changing area niche genetic algorithm (CANGA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was developed to improve the spectrum peak search accuracy and reduce the amount calculations of MUSIC algorithm. The power spectrum function of the MUSIC algorithm was used as the fitness function of the hybrid algorithm. The echo frequency was estimated by the variable value corresponding to the optimal solution. The proposed hybrid PSO-CANGA has the characteristics of strong global search ability and fast convergence speed to improve the performance of MUSIC algorithm. The numerical comparisons were performed. The results showed that the hybrid PSO-CANGA gives fastest convergence and the highest estimation accuracy compared to original PSO and NGA. In addition, compared with traditional spectrum estimation algorithms, the proposed algorithm had a minimum estimation error with standard deviation of 0.27KHz. The proposed demodulation method was used to SAW strain system. The nonlinearity of the strain measurement was improved, with a nonlinearity of 0.55%. Simulation and experiment results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the demodulation of the SAW strain sensor system. It helps to improve the accuracy of SAW strain measurement.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2021.3116060","startPage":"24246","endPage":"24253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/9594098/09551268.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3116060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Precision Demodulation Method for Surface Acoustic Wave Strain Sensor Based on Hybrid Changing Area Niche Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface acoustic waves","Sensors","Strain","Frequency estimation","Multiple signal classification","Signal processing algorithms","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surface acoustic wave strain system","variable area search","niche genetic algorithm","particle swarm optimization algorithm","MUSIC algorithm","frequency estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"High-Precision Demodulation Method for Surface Acoustic Wave Strain Sensor Based on Hybrid Changing Area Niche Genetic Algorithm","volume":"21","issue":"21","htmlLink":"/document/9551268/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51705326 and 52075339"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Precision Demodulation Method for Surface Acoustic Wave Strain Sensor Based on Hybrid Changing Area Niche Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"jsen-fan-3116060-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083733S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9594098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9594098","articleId":"9551268","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9551281,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Fang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Chang\u2019an University, Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China","Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Information Communication Network and Security, Xi\u2019an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yong Fang (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees in communications engineering from the School of Communications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China, in 2000, 2003, and 2005, respectively.","In 2007, he was a Lecturer with the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xi\u2019an.

The rate loss of DAC bitstream is caused by two factors: \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">unequal coset partitioning</i>\n and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">bit indivisibility</i>\n. It is proved that as code length goes to infinity, the expected value of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">bit-indivisibility</i>\n rate loss will tend to 0.5 for any irrational Rate Change Step (RCS), where the RCS refers to the rate change when one source bit is flipped. With the help of CCS, the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">bit-indivisibility</i>\n rate loss can be compensated to some extend. Especially, for any irrational RCS, as code length goes to infinity, the expected value of the remaining \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">bit-indivisibility</i>\n rate loss after compensation will tend to about 0.47. The second application of CCS is DAC decoder design. We derive the formula of path metric and find that in the original paper on DAC, the intuitive formula of path metric is not correct. The \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">backward-replacing</i>\n algorithm is proposed to make full use of memory. Experimental results confirm the correctness of theoretical analyses.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9622121/09551281.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3116082","startPage":"8335","endPage":"8350","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3116082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Two Applications of Coset Cardinality Spectrum of Distributed Arithmetic Coding","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"67","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551281/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB0505602"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the Shaanxi Province Key Laboratory of Information Communication Network and Security, China","grantNumber":"ICNS202002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071377"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100017596","fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, China","grantNumber":"2021JM-188"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two Applications of Coset Cardinality Spectrum of Distributed Arithmetic Coding","sourcePdf":"tit-fang-3116082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144339S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9622121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9622121","articleId":"9551281","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9551283,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Van Tam","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Phenikaa University, Hanoi, Vietnam","Phenikaa Research and Technology Institute (PRATI), A&A Phoenix Group JSC, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":"Van Tam","orcid":"0000-0002-1499-1381"},{"name":"Nguyen Quang Hieu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Nguyen Quang","lastName":"Hieu","orcid":"0000-0003-1517-8285"},{"name":"Nguyen Thi Thanh Van","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Phenikaa University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Thi","lastName":"Thanh Van"},{"name":"Nguyen Cong Luong","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Phenikaa University, Hanoi, Vietnam","Phenikaa Research and Technology Institute (PRATI), A&A Phoenix Group JSC, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Cong","lastName":"Luong","orcid":"0000-0002-4299-3456"},{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato","orcid":"0000-0002-7442-7416"},{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong In","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0001-7711-8072"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9551283","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we consider a Coded Edge Computing (CEC) network in which a client encodes its computation subtasks using the Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code before offloading them to helpers. The CEC network is heterogeneous in which the helpers are different in computing capacity, wireless communication stability, and computing price. Thus, the client needs to determine a desirable size of MDS-coded subtasks and selects proper helpers such that the computation latency is within the deadline and the incentive cost is minimal. This problem is challenging since the helpers are generally dynamic and random in the computing, communication, and computing price. We thus propose to adopt a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that allows the client to learn and find optimal decisions without any prior knowledge of network environments. The experiment results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard Q-learning and baseline algorithms in both terms of computation latency and incentive cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Task Offloading in Coded Edge Computing: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3116036","endPage":"3882","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09551283.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"3878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3116036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551283","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Costs","Reinforcement learning","Codes","Edge computing","Partitioning algorithms","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum distance separable code","coded edge computing","deep reinforcement learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Task Offloading in Coded Edge Computing: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9551283/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation (NRF), Singapore, funded under Energy Research Test-Bed and Industry Partnership Funding Initiative"},{"fundingName":"Energy Grid (EG) 2.0 programme, Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research (AIR) Program and Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute (JRI)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation, Singapore under the AI Singapore Programme (AISG) (AISG2-RP-2020-019), WASP/NTU grant M4082187 (4080) and Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Tier 1 (RG16/20), and the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ICT Creative Consilience program (IITP-2020-0-01821) supervised by the IITP"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Task Offloading in Coded Edge Computing: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"lcomm-congluong-3116036-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063481S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9551283","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9551395,"authors":[{"name":"Shivin Devgon","affiliation":["The AUTOLAB at the University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Shivin","lastName":"Devgon","id":"37088526474"},{"name":"Jeffrey Ichnowski","affiliation":["The AUTOLAB at the University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Ichnowski","id":"38541287200"},{"name":"Michael Danielczuk","affiliation":["The AUTOLAB at the University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Danielczuk","id":"37086541913"},{"name":"Daniel S.

Kitting is a critical step as it can decrease downstream processing and handling times and enable lower storage and shipping costs. We present Kit-Net, a framework for kitting previously unseen 3D objects into cavities given depth images of both the target cavity and an object held by a gripper in an unknown initial orientation. Kit-Net uses self-supervised deep learning and data-augmentation to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to robustly estimate 3D rotations between objects and matching concave or convex cavities using a large training dataset of simulated depth images pairs. Kit-Net then uses the trained CNN to implement a controller to orient and position novel objects for insertion into novel prismatic and conformal 3D cavities. Experiments in simulation suggest that Kit-Net can orient objects to have a 98.9% average intersection volume between the object mesh and that of the target cavity. Physical experiments with industrial objects succeed in 18 % of trials using a baseline method and in 63% of trials with Kit-Net.

In this method, motion sequence is generated based on past motion experience. The rough procedure is as follows. Various reaching motions are performed by the manipulator in advance, and then, these experiences are stored by the manipulator as end-effector poses, joint angles, environment map, and so on. Then, the manipulator generates a new motion sequence by efficiently using the past experiences when a new target end-effector pose is given. The proposed method comprises two phases: similar experience search and motion modification. In the latter phase, a neural network is utilized to calculate the amount of modification movement. It ensures a certain level of trajectory reproducibility. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proven via simulation considering planar and 3D manipulators.","doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551436","startPage":"905","endPage":"912","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551387/9551265/09551436.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Motion Generation Method for Articulated Manipulators Using Linear Mapping Matrices Calculated by Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Solid modeling","Transmission line matrix methods","Three-dimensional displays","Neural networks","Training data","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end effectors","matrix algebra","motion control","neural nets","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-effector poses","environment map","motion sequence","motion modification","neural network","motion generation method","articulated manipulators","linear mapping matrices","motion experience","rough procedure","trajectory reproducibility"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Motion Generation Method for Articulated Manipulators Using Linear Mapping Matrices Calculated by Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551436/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21202005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Motion Generation Method for Articulated Manipulators Using Linear Mapping Matrices Calculated by Neural Networks","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115539S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9551450,"authors":[{"name":"Junan Chen","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY"],"firstName":"Junan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088984645"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086565708"},{"name":"Ruihan Wu","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY"],"firstName":"Ruihan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37088454198"},{"name":"Mark Campbell","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Campbell","id":"37272971700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"9551450","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Computer aided software engineering","Automation","Roads","Conferences","Predictive models","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","graph theory","intelligent transportation systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial-temporal graph neural network","interaction-aware vehicle trajectory prediction","temporal block","unstructured scenes","recurrent neural network","subtle interactions","STGNN model","unstructured scene dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551450","abstract":"In this paper, a Spatial Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) model is developed, including a temporal block and Graph Neural Network (GNN) block, to solve the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction in unstructured scenes.

The analysis is triggered to find the root cause of a failure and its findings, recorded in a reporting system using natural language. Fault analysis, physical analysis, sample preparation and package construction analysis are arguably the most used analysis activity for determining the root-cause of a failure.

This method mainly focuses on the rotation of cameras around the corresponding spatial axes with deviation. In the offline calibration, the installation matrices and baseline matrix are determined by introducing geometrical characteristics that represents the relationship of rotation axis and the transformation of camera rotation. On this basis, the extrinsic parameters can be updated online. The proposed method solves the problem where the spatial relationship between each camera and its rotation axis can be arbitrary, which has been verified by the simulations as well as tracking and measurement experiments on the developed active stereovision platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551387/9551265/09551530.pdf","startPage":"1776","endPage":"1781","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Geometric Calibration Method for Active Stereovision System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coordinate measuring machines","Computer aided software engineering","Automation","Machine vision","Conferences","Cameras","Calibration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Geometric Calibration Method for Active Stereovision System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551530/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61973302,62073322,61633020,Z191100008019004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Geometric Calibration Method for Active Stereovision System","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081992S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9551539,"authors":[{"name":"Salvador Ortiz","affiliation":["CINVESTAV-IPN (National Polytechnic Institute), Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Ortiz","id":"37086568799"},{"name":"Wen Yu","affiliation":["CINVESTAV-IPN (National Polytechnic Institute), Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279841300"},{"name":"Xiaoou Li","affiliation":["CINVESTAV-IPN (National Polytechnic Institute), Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Li","id":"37280872700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"9551539","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Uncertainty","Navigation","Conferences","Path planning","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mobile robots","path planning","SLAM (robots)","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous navigation","robust SLAM","genetic algorithm","unknown environment","good map","effective path planning algorithm","sliding mode method","novel SLAM","good convergence ability","others popular methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551539","abstract":"Autonomous navigation in unknown environment is a big challenge.

Thanks to the advantages of distributed architecture and computation efficiency improvements, deep learning methods have gained much interest and have been investigated by researchers for thorough industrial data analysis, notably for anomaly detection. A comparative evaluation of data-driven deep learning methods used to detect anomalies occurring during equipment processing is proposed. This evaluation is done on a total of six methods, their ability to detect anomalies on raw sensor data, collected on semiconductor machines, with variable correlations and temporal dependencies is discussed. The evaluation gives an insight on the industrial performances on the methods and shows how the supervised learning methods outperform the other models with less training time but need labelled data meanwhile some self-supervised learning methods have good detection performances with training done on normal data only.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Techniques on Semiconductor Multivariate Time Series Data","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551541","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551387/9551265/09551541.pdf","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Techniques on Semiconductor Multivariate Time Series Data","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551541/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004347","fundingName":"STMicroelectronics","grantNumber":"826589"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Techniques on Semiconductor Multivariate Time Series Data","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081292S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9551555,"authors":[{"name":"Christian John Immanuel S.

Unique characteristics of HMLV semiconductor assembly and testing operations include: (1) Diversified Product Lines: To respond to global competition and different customer needs, manufacturers are providing diversified products to different consumers; (2) Unrelated Parallel Machines: Different machines are oftentimes procured at different capacity expansion stages. While different machines may have similar functions, the latest model oftentimes provides higher production efficiency and better quality. This leads to a production environment with parallel machines of different production characteristics; (3) Incomplete Product-machine Specific Production Data: When there are a wide variety of products produced by unrelated parallel machines, there will be a large number of possible product-machine combinations. Some of the combinations will not have enough data for accurate estimation of production characteristics, such as the required processing time information for scheduling decisions. In order to facilitate efficient and effective scheduling decisions in such HMLV production, a hierarchical prediction method is developed for mixed dataset analysis. The hierarchical prediction method generates missing parameters, such as the required processing time, for subsequent optimization of scheduling decisions. To cope with the inevitable errors in all forecast models, robust scheduling decisions are generated through a stochastic optimization framework. The framework is validated by an industry dataset collected from a leading semiconductor assembly and testing company.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551555","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551387/9551265/09551555.pdf","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1308","doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven Scheduling for High-mix and Low-volume Production in Semiconductor Assembly and Testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven Scheduling for High-mix and Low-volume Production in Semiconductor Assembly and Testing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551555/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21201908","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551555/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven Scheduling for High-mix and Low-volume Production in Semiconductor Assembly and Testing","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092137S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9551568,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Nehme","affiliation":["SITIA, Bouguenais, France","Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, ESIGELEC, IRSEEM, Rouen, France"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Nehme","id":"37085885996"},{"name":"Cl\u00e9ment Aubry","affiliation":["SITIA, Bouguenais, France"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e9ment","lastName":"Aubry","id":"37086227252"},{"name":"Romain Rossi","affiliation":["Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, ESIGELEC, IRSEEM, Rouen, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37683039400"},{"name":"R\u00e9mi Boutteau","affiliation":["Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, UNILEHAVRE, INSA Rouen, LITIS, Rouen, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Boutteau","id":"37586304800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"9551568","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Navigation","Wheels","Transforms","Robot sensing systems","Reliability","Task analysis"]}],"abstract":"Local perception navigation methods allow agricultural robots to accurately track crop row structures while performing automated farming tasks.

To this end, a convolutional neural network was trained in one-class classification fashion on Hough representations of LiDAR point clouds.

We propose a simple framework for learning surgical action primitives that can be used as building blocks for composing more elaborate surgical tasks. Our method is based on Learning from Demonstration (LfD) as this allows us to exploit existing expert knowledge from recordings of surgical procedures. We demonstrate that we can learn needle manipulation actions from human demonstration, constructing an action library which is used to autonomously execute part of a surgical suturing task. Actions are learned from single demonstrations and we use Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to encode low-level Cartesian space trajectories.

Decision-Making under Incomplete Information Using The Artificial Neural Network","abstract":"The Anti Saturation Attack is a vital problem in the field of military defense. When confronted with a large scale missile attack in a short duration, how to optimally allocate interceptor missiles to minimize the loss of total assets until the end of the attack has been studied by many researchers. Recently, deep reinforcement learning methods have been applied to achieve a suboptimal defense policy. Yet there still remains some problems. The convergence process is dependent on the computing resources and the accumulated policies can not be well explained. Moreover, when the attack parameters in the environment is changed, the model needs to be trained from the beginning again, which limits the usage in real time decision-making scenarios. To this end, we propose a hybrid method, which speeds up the approximation to the optimal policy and can explain the attack patterns from the statistical point of view. Furthermore, the light-weight structure makes it possible to deploy in real-time cases. First, an integer convex optimization model is set up to generate initial data and feed the neural network. Second, a neural network and TD methods are implemented to predict the final asset value. Last but not least, the potential usage of the proposed method is testified in a simulation environment where different battlefield parameters and experiments have been set up and conducted. With comparison of other two methods (Heuristic and Deep Q-Network), experiments indicate the hybrid method outperforms the other two methods, with convergence speed nearly 20% faster than the DQN method and expectation of final assets value 12\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup>\n higher when training in the same episodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551574/","accessionNumber":"21202044","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551574/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Missile Defense Decision-Making under Incomplete Information Using The Artificial Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010878","fundingName":"State Administration of Science & Technology and Industry for National Defense","grantNumber":"JCKY2020206B028"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U19B2029,U1909204,61773381,61773382,61701471,61872365"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Missile Defense Decision-Making under Incomplete Information Using The Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077184S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9551605,"authors":[{"name":"Hannes Vietz","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering at University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Vietz","id":"37088520325"},{"name":"Tristan Rauch","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering at University of Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Tristan","lastName":"Rauch","id":"37088987020"},{"name":"Andreas L\u00f6cklin","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering at University of Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"L\u00f6cklin","id":"37087892982"},{"name":"Nasser Jazdi","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering at University of Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Jazdi","id":"37298754800"},{"name":"Michael Weyrich","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering at University of Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Weyrich","id":"38530484800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"9551605","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Visualization","Image recognition","Runtime","Tools","Generators","Cognition"]}],"abstract":"Developing consistently well performing visual recognition applications based on convolutional neural networks, e.g. for autonomous driving, is very challenging. One of the obstacles during the development is the opaqueness of their cognitive behaviour. A considerable amount of literature has been published which describes irrational behaviour of trained CNNs showcasing gaps in their cognition. In this paper, a methodology is presented that creates worst-case images using image augmentation techniques. If the CNN's cognitive performance on such images is weak while the augmentation techniques are supposedly harmless, a potential gap in the cognition has been found. The presented worst-case image generator is using adversarial search approaches to efficiently identify the most challenging (worst) image. This is evaluated with the well-known AlexNet CNN using images depicting a typical driving scenario.","doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551605","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference

will provide valuable information for secured and economical system operation in electricity markets. This paper focuses on the uncertainty set prediction of the aggregated generation of geographically distributed wind farms. A Spatio-temporal model is proposed to learn the dynamic features from partial observation in near-surface wind fields of neighboring wind farms. We use Bayesian LSTM, a probabilistic prediction model, to obtain the uncertainty set of the generation in individual wind farms. Then, spatial correlation between different wind farms is presented to correct the output results. Numerical testing results based on the actual data with 6 wind farms in northwest China show that the uncertainty set of aggregated wind generation of distributed wind farms is less volatile than that of a single wind farm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551610/","accessionNumber":"21201862","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551610/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Uncertainty Set Prediction of Aggregated Wind Power Generation based on Bayesian LSTM and Spatio- Temporal Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773308"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertainty Set Prediction of Aggregated Wind Power Generation based on Bayesian LSTM and Spatio- Temporal Analysis","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072979S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9551635,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Giusti","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Giusti","id":"37085736984"},{"name":"Valerio Magnago","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Valerio","lastName":"Magnago","id":"37086254678"},{"name":"Dietmar Siegele","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Siegele","id":"37088981540"},{"name":"Michael Terzer","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Terzer","id":"37086120211"},{"name":"Camilla Follini","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Camilla","lastName":"Follini","id":"37086562785"},{"name":"Simone Garbin","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Garbin","id":"37088983720"},{"name":"Carmen Marcher","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Marcher","id":"37088986909"},{"name":"Dieter Steiner","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Steiner","id":"37088983682"},{"name":"Alice Schweigkofler","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Schweigkofler","id":"37088987184"},{"name":"Michael Riedl","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Italia Research, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Riedl","id":"37088594703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"9551635","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Shape","Buildings","Semantics","Spraying","Manipulators"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel mobile robot manipulator named BALTO, which can precisely and autonomously disinfect critical items of buildings, yet be easily deployed in different environments by non-expert operators. Conventional approaches based on greedy disinfection actions can be dangerous for surrounding humans, or provide non-controlled coverage of critical items such as door-handles, push-bars or switches. Other robotic solutions providing precision disinfection can require time-consuming geometric and semantic mapping of the environment, placement of non-natural landmarks, or the presence of an operator on-site for programming to adapt to the use case. Our approach is different: we integrate preliminary knowledge of the building within the robot control system itself, using Building Information Modelling (BIM) data readily available from modern construction processes. BIM models completely describe a building and its components with the corresponding geometric and semantic data. We use these data to provide the robot with the components to disinfect and their location, as well as the description of the environment in which it operates, without requiring any prior mapping procedure. Precise disinfection actions are enabled by an automatic calibration procedure based on a learned 3D model of the target. We finally present results of experiments performed in operational environment that verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution.","doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551635","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551387/9551265/09551635.pdf","startPage":"1730","endPage":"1737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BALTO: A BIM-Integrated Mobile Robot Manipulator for Precise and Autonomous Disinfection in Buildings against COVID-19","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551635/","displayDocTitle":"BALTO: A BIM-Integrated Mobile Robot Manipulator for Precise and Autonomous Disinfection in Buildings against COVID-19","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551635/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003185","fundingName":"Fraunhofer","grantNumber":"Anti-Corona 840241"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BALTO: A BIM-Integrated Mobile Robot Manipulator for Precise and Autonomous Disinfection in Buildings against COVID-19","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100181S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9551636,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Hammerbacher","affiliation":["Ostwestfalen-Lippe University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany","Phoenix Contact Electronics GmbH, Bad Pyrmont, Germany"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Hammerbacher","id":"37088982179"},{"name":"Markus Lange-Hegermann","affiliation":["Ostwestfalen-Lippe University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Lange-Hegermann","id":"37088982359"},{"name":"Gorden Platz","affiliation":["Phoenix Contact Electronics GmbH, Bad Pyrmont, Germany"],"firstName":"Gorden","lastName":"Platz","id":"37088987060"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"9551636","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neural networks","Transfer learning","Time series analysis","Supervised learning","Training data","Production"]}],"abstract":"Digitalization leads to data transparency for production systems that we can benefit from with data-driven analysis methods like neural networks. For example, automated anomaly detection enables saving resources and optimizing the production. We study using rarely occurring information about labeled anomalies into Variational Autoencoder neural network structures to overcome information deficits of supervised and unsupervised approaches. This method outperforms all other models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. We evaluate the following methods: Principal Component Analysis, Isolation Forest, Classifying Neural Networks, and Variational Autoencoders on seven time series datasets to find the best performing detection methods. We extend this idea to include more infrequently occurring meta information about production processes. This use of sparse labels, both of anomalies or production data, allows to harness any additional information available for increasing anomaly detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551636","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551387/9551265/09551636.pdf","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Including Sparse Production Knowledge into Variational Autoencoders to Increase Anomaly Detection Reliability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551636/","displayDocTitle":"Including Sparse Production Knowledge into Variational Autoencoders to Increase Anomaly Detection Reliability","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551636/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Including Sparse Production Knowledge into Variational Autoencoders to Increase Anomaly Detection Reliability","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096623S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9551637,"authors":[{"name":"Jonas le Fevre Sejersen","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence in Robotics Laboratory (Air Lab), Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"le Fevre Sejersen","id":"37088995681"},{"name":"Rui Pimentel De Figueiredo","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence in Robotics Laboratory (Air Lab), Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Pimentel De Figueiredo","id":"37088994740"},{"name":"Erdal Kayacan","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence in Robotics Laboratory (Air Lab), Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Kayacan","id":"37595300900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"9551637","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Visualization","Navigation","Magnetometers","Simulation","Semantics","Estimation"]}],"abstract":"In the maritime sector, safe vessel navigation is of great importance, particularly in congested harbors and waterways. The focus of this work is to estimate the distance between an object of interest and potential obstacles using a companion UAV. The proposed approach fuses global positioning system (GPS) data with long-range aerial images. First, we employ semantic segmentation deep neural networks (DNNs) for discriminating the vessel of interest, water, and potential solid objects using raw image data. The network is trained with both real and images generated and automatically labeled from a realistic AirSim simulation environment. Then, the distances between the extracted vessel and non-water obstacle blobs are computed using a novel ground sample distance (GSD) estimation algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to detect and estimate distances to unknown objects from long-range visual data captured with conventional RGB cameras and auxiliary absolute positioning systems (e.g. GPS). The simulation results illustrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed method for visually aided navigation of vessels assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).","doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551637","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551387/9551265/09551637.pdf","startPage":"1901","endPage":"1907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safe Vessel Navigation Visually Aided by Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Congested Harbors and Waterways","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551637/","displayDocTitle":"Safe Vessel Navigation Visually Aided by Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Congested Harbors and Waterways","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551637/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"RFM-17-0020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010078","fundingName":"Region Midtjylland","grantNumber":"RFM-17-0020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safe Vessel Navigation Visually Aided by Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Congested Harbors and Waterways","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114265S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9551656,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Giehl","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Fraunhofer Research Institute for Applied and Integrated Security AISEC, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Giehl","id":"37086584650"},{"name":"Michael P.

However, due to its energy characteristics of short duration, high power peak and complex electromechanical operating of the spindle motor, the energy consumption of the spindle acceleration process is difficult to calculate accurately. To fill this gap, a data-driven method for machine tool spindle acceleration energy prediction is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the energy characteristics of spindle acceleration are studied, and a dataset for the energy prediction is determined. Secondly, an automatic extraction algorithm is developed to extract the time data of power peak, and then a framework for data collection and preprocessing is proposed. Thirdly, a spindle acceleration energy prediction model is established with Back-propagation Neural Network based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA-BP), and the network structure and the operation process are also studied. Finally, a case study of spindle acceleration is given to verify the validity of the proposed approach and model, and the accuracy is also verified with other algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accelerometers","Energy consumption","Power measurement","Machine tool spindles","Predictive models","Tools","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","energy consumption","genetic algorithms","machine tool spindles","mechanical engineering computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven method","energy consumption","machining process","energy efficiency","machine tools","energy characteristics","high power peak","complex electromechanical operating","spindle motor","spindle acceleration process","machine tool spindle acceleration energy prediction","data collection","spindle acceleration energy prediction model","back-propagation neural network","genetic algorithm","spindle acceleration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spindle acceleration","data-driven","energy prediction","GA-BP","machine tool"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551682","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9551387/9551265/09551682.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9551265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven method for predicting energy consumption of machine tool spindle acceleration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven method for predicting energy consumption of machine tool spindle acceleration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551682/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551682/","accessionNumber":"21202060","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven method for predicting energy consumption of machine tool spindle acceleration","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"0225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057652S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9551387","isNumber":"9551265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9551387","xplore-issue":"9551265","articleId":"9551682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9551692,"authors":[{"name":"Alice Lanniel","affiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany.

In the actual engineering operation, there are many reasons for the commutation failure. In order to diagnose the causes in real-time and effectively, this article proposes a new method for the fault diagnosis of the commutation failure based on the combination of the wavelet transform and wavelet neural network (WNN). First, by analyzing the changes in electrical characteristics caused by the failure of commutation, the voltage signal of the inverter side commutation bus is finally selected as the feature signal for diagnosis. Then, the wavelet transform is used as a tool for extracting fault feature quantities, and the root mean square (rms) value of the wavelet detail coefficients, wavelet energy skewness, and wavelet energy spectrum information entropy of the inverter side commutation bus voltage signal after wavelet decomposition are used as three feature parameters. At the same time, wavelet packet decomposition is performed on the inverter side commutation bus voltage signal, and the wavelet packet subband energy, energy entropy, and energy skewness are extracted as the other three feature vectors. Finally, the simulation test data shows that the proposed fault diagnosis method can accurately identify the specific fault causes and has high reference value and specific engineering guiding significance for improving the reliability of the HVDC transmission system. Compared with the traditional BP neural network method for fault diagnosis of commutation failure, the proposed diagnosis method considers the fault type more comprehensively, the diagnosis speed is faster, and the recognition accuracy rate is higher in the case of a small number of samples.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3115574","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3115574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09551726.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Commutation Failure Using Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Neural Network in HVDC Transmission System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551726/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Commutation Failure Using Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Neural Network in HVDC Transmission System","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9551726/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21126649","externalId":"3525408","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Project Research on Key Technologies of High Gain, High Density, Modular PV System in MVDC Distribution Network"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"52077173"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnosis of Commutation Failure Using Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Neural Network in HVDC Transmission System","sourcePdf":"tim-liu-3115574-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086014S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9551726","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9551730,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Dai","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9655601/9551730/dai-3116052-small.gif","p":["Xiaoming Dai received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and automation (with Hons.) from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.

By exploring the sparsity in the frequency domain, it constructs the desired impulse response with few complex exponential series (CES) and very sparse additional coefficients (AC) with equal length. The design problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem by confining the frequencies of CES to a finite dictionary. To reduce the computational complexity at optimization, an iterative algorithm is presented, where appropriate frequencies of CES and zero locations of AC can be quickly determined. Thereafter, an efficient parallel structure is introduced to implement the proposed filter. To verify the performance of the proposed method, MATLAB simulation and Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation are made. It shows that the proposed method requires 18 bits \u00d7 23 bits word length while the existing advanced recursive realization method \u2014the piecewise-polynomial-sinusoidal recursive\u2014needs 59 bits \u00d7 59 bits for the same filter specifications. Meanwhile, the method can achieve comparable multiplier reduction compared with the state-of-the-art low-complexity techniques but produce a low extra group delay. Moreover, it can realize variable bandedges with a fixed filter structure.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3115352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09551733.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3115352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6101","endPage":"6115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Linear-Phase FIR Filters With a Complex Exponential Impulse Response","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Linear-Phase FIR Filters With a Complex Exponential Impulse Response","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551733/","volume":"69","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Project","grantNumber":"2019YFB1804100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61725102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Linear-Phase FIR Filters With a Complex Exponential Impulse Response","sourcePdf":"tsp-yang-3115352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032277S","chronDate":"2021","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","articleId":"9551733","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":9551757,"authors":[{"name":"Jingfu Li","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9619988/9551757/li-3115806-small.gif","p":["Jingfu Li received the B.S. degree from the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2016 and he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.

However, most of the traditional IA schemes suffer from the high computational complexity and require the global and instantaneous channel state information (CSI), both of which make them difficult to be extended to cellular MIMO systems. To handle these issues, two new IA schemes, i.e., the retrospective interference regeneration (RIR) scheme and the beamforming based distributed retrospective interference alignment (B-DRIA) scheme, are proposed for cellular \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-user MIMO downlink networks. For the RIR scheme, it adopts interference elimination algorithm to erase redundant symbols in inter-cell interference (ICI) signals, and then uses interference regeneration algorithm to avoid secondary interference. The RIR scheme obtains greater DoF gain than the retrospective interference alignment (RIA) scheme, but incurs performance degradation when the transceiver antennas ratio (TAR) approaches 1. Therefore, the B-DRIA scheme is further proposed. For the B-DRIA scheme, the cellular beamforming matrix is introduced to eliminate the ICI, and meanwhile distributed RIA algorithm is adopted to align inter-user interference (IUI). The simulation results show that the B-DRIA scheme obtains larger DoF than the RIR scheme locally. Specifically, when TAR approaches 1, two schemes obtain the same DoF. While TAR approaches 2, the DoF of the B-DRIA scheme is superior than the RIR scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3115806","startPage":"11827","endPage":"11842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3115806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619988","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9619988/09551757.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two New Kinds of Interference Alignment Schemes for Cellular --User MIMO Downlink Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551757/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Two New Kinds of Interference Alignment Schemes for Cellular <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula>-User MIMO Downlink Networks","volume":"70","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9551757/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001067"},{"fundingName":"Nanyang Technological University Startup Grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007040","fundingName":"Singapore University of Technology and Design","grantNumber":"SRG-ISTD-2021-165"},{"fundingName":"Alibaba Group"},{"fundingName":"Alibaba Innovative Research"},{"fundingName":"Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Re-search Institute","grantNumber":"AN-GC-2021-002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001475","fundingName":"Nanyang Technological University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two New Kinds of Interference Alignment Schemes for Cellular <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula>-User MIMO Downlink Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-3115806-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110843S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9619988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9619988","articleId":"9551757","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9551760,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9619988/9551760/yang-3116190-small.gif","p":["Jing Yang received the Ph.D. degree in communications and information systems from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2013.

In the considered system, the energy harvesting node harvests energy from the radio-frequency signals sent by the dedicated PB and uses this energy to communicate with the destination node. To accurately model the combined effect of multi-path fading and shadowing, it is assumed that the energy transfer link is subject to \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\kappa$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n shadowed fading.

Moreover, in order to obtain further insights on the impact of key parameters on the system performance, asymptotic EC expressions which become very tight at low- and high-signal-to-noise ratio regimes, are obtained. Using the proposed EC lower bound as well as these asymptotic results, simple closed-form expressions for the optimal time split that maximize the achievable EC are derived. Numerically evaluated results accompanied with Monte-Carlo simulations are further presented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3116190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3116190","startPage":"11869","endPage":"11880","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9619988/09551760.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis of Power Beacon-Assisted Energy Harvesting MIMO System Over - Shadowed Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis of Power Beacon-Assisted Energy Harvesting MIMO System Over <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\kappa -\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula> Shadowed Fading Channels","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","volume":"70","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551760/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Young and middle-aged academic leaders of Yangzhou University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis of Power Beacon-Assisted Energy Harvesting MIMO System Over <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\kappa -\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula> Shadowed Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-3116190-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107572S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9619988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9619988","articleId":"9551760","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9551762,"authors":[{"name":"Fuwei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fuwei","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-0005-7782","id":"37086862959"},{"name":"Lifeng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Lai","orcid":"0000-0002-9493-8248","id":"37402804900"},{"name":"Shuguang Cui","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data and Future Network of Intelligence Institute, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Shuguang","lastName":"Cui","orcid":"0000-0003-2608-775X","id":"37086883852"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9551762","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear regression","Robustness","Optimization methods","Training data","Tuning","Support vector machines","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear regression","adversarial robustness","poisoning attack","non-convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate how to manipulate the coefficients obtained via linear regression by adding carefully designed poisoning data points to the dataset or modifying the original data points.

We then extend the analysis to a more challenging scenario where the attacker aims to change one particular regression coefficient while making others to be changed as small as possible.

However, several studies point out that existing GAN-based methods are heavily affected by the complexity and inefficient description issues of HSIs. The discriminator in GAN always attempts to interpret high-dimensional nonlinear spectral knowledge of HSIs, thus resulting in the Hughes phenomenon. Another critical issue is sample generation. The generator is only used as a regularizer for the discriminator, which seriously restricts the performance for classification. In this article, we propose SSAT-GAN, a semisupervised spectral\u2013spatial attention feature extraction approach based on the GAN that feeds raw data into a deep learning framework, in an end-to-end fashion. First, the unlabeled data is added into the discriminator to alleviate the problems of training samples and supplies a reconstructed real HSI data distribution through adversarial training. Second, to enhance the description of HSIs, we build spectral\u2013spatial attention modules (SSAT) and extend them to the discriminator and the generator to extract discriminative characteristics from abundant spatial contexts and spectral signatures. The SSAT modules learn a three-dimensional filter bank with spectral\u2013spatial attention weights to obtain meaningful feature maps to improve the discrimination of the feature representation. In terms of the mode collapse of GANs, the mean minimization loss is employed for unsupervised learning. Experimental results from three real datasets indicate that SSAT-GAN has certain advantages over the state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Attention Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Generative Adversarial Network","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3115971","startPage":"10017","endPage":"10032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3115971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09551774.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Attention Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Generative Adversarial Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9551774/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province of China","grantNumber":"2020AAC02028"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province of China","grantNumber":"2021AAC03179"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Attention Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Generative Adversarial Network","sourcePdf":"jstars-liang-3115971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150784S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","articleId":"9551774","onlineDate":"28 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9551853,"authors":[{"name":"Helena A.

In this paper, we propose a deep neural network to identify violent videos, with an approach capable of working in real video and synthetic video. An efficient detector of the 2D pose together with a multiple person tracker is used to extract motion features from the video sequence that will be fed directly into the proposed network. The proposed convolutional neural network is a recurrent neural network for a Spatio-temporal prediction that has convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, which enables the analysis of local motion in the video. By stacking multiple ConvLSTM layers and forming an encoding-forecasting structure, we obtain a network model for the violence detection problem and more general spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problems. The inputs for the model correspond to sequences of keypoints extracted from the skeletons present in each frame originating an output corresponding to the classification of the video. The model was trained and evaluated with an innovative dataset that contains violent videos from a popular fighting game and non-violent videos related to people's daily lives. Comparison of the results obtained with the state-of-the-art techniques revealed the promising capability of the proposed method in recognizing violent videos with 100% precision, although it is not as robust as other datasets.

We find the tight asymptotic behavior of the fraction of such monomials when the number of variables \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n is fixed and the alphabet size \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$q=2^\\ell $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n is large. Using these results, we give a new explicit construction of batch codes utilizing lifted Reed-Solomon codes. For some parameter regimes, these codes have a better trade-off between parameters than previously known batch codes. Further, we show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between redundancy and the number of disjoint recovering sets for every codeword or information symbol than previously known constructions, thereby providing the best known PIR codes for some parameter regimes. Additionally, we present a new local self-correction algorithm for lifted multiplicity codes.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9622121/09551886.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3116520","startPage":"8051","endPage":"8069","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3116520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551886/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Lifted Reed-Solomon Codes and Lifted Multiplicity Codes","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"67","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551886/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011102","fundingName":"Technical University of Munich\u2014Institute for Advanced Study by the German Excellence Initiative and European Union 7th Framework Program","grantNumber":"291763"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)","grantNumber":"WA3907/1-1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006769","fundingName":"Russian Science Foundation","grantNumber":"19-71-00137"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1817/18"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100016296","fundingName":"Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center and the Israel National Cyber Directorate"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lifted Reed-Solomon Codes and Lifted Multiplicity Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-polianskii-3116520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176939S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9622121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9622121","articleId":"9551886","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9551887,"authors":[{"name":"\u0141ukasz Sobolewski","affiliation":["Institute of Metrology, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Zielona G\u00f3ra, Zielona G\u00f3ra, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9551887/sobol-3116297-small.gif","p":["\u0141ukasz Sobolewski received the M.S. degree in computer science and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Zielona G\u00f3ra, Poland, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Institute of Metrology, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Zielona G\u00f3ra.

The research has been conducted in close cooperation with the Time and Frequency Laboratory of Central Office of Measures, responsible for the realization of the UTC(PL). The planned experiment covered a 50-month period, in which the UTC(PL) timescale has been carried out using, as a master clock, atomic clocks with different properties: commercial cesium atomic clock 5071A Opt. 001 (first case) and VCH-1003M hydrogen maser (second and third cases). In case of the developed predicting procedure by means of group method of data handling (GMDH)-type neural network (NN), the transitional period (second case) in which the master clock had been replaced by the new clock, is also very important. For GMDH-type NN, input data as a TS1 and TS2 time series have been prepared, based on the already-known differences of UTC(PL) from UTC and UTC rapid timescales and on determined differences between UTC(PL) and the master clock steering the UTC(PL). The method of preparing TS1 and TS2 time series is an important part of the developed procedure for predicting UTC(PL) differences from UTC, before they will be calculated and published by fr. Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The obtained research results confirmed that the developed predicting procedure by means of GMDH-type NN ensures a proper quality of maintaining the national timescale. The best quality of UTC(PL) predicting has been achieved for the third case, both for data prepared according to the TS1 and TS2 time series. This is confirmed by the calculated values of the prediction quality measures and the Modified Allan deviation. On the other hand, the second case confirmed the possibility of using the proprietary development of the TS2 time series to predict UTC-UTC(k) differences. This time series is a very good alternative for the TS1 time series, when the amount of data in this series is insufficient due to replacement of the clock or its failure.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3116297","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09551887.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3116297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Verification of the Neural Network Predicting Procedure Applied for UTC(PL)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Verification of the Neural Network Predicting Procedure Applied for UTC(PL)","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","accessionNumber":"21126641","publicationDate":"2021","externalId":"1009809","htmlLink":"/document/9551887/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000190","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Commerce","grantNumber":"BS123456"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Verification of the Neural Network Predicting Procedure Applied for UTC(PL)","sourcePdf":"tim-sobolewski-3116297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070947S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9551887","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9551929,"authors":[{"name":"Shanuja Sasi","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Bengaluru, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9551929/sasi-3116229-small.gif","p":["Shanuja Sasi (Member, IEEE) was born in Kerala, India.

Early failure detection and prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of critical industrial machines/components are the main challenges addressed by PHM methodologies. In literature, model-based and data-driven methods are widely used for RUL estimation. Model-based methods rely on empirical/phenomenological degradation models for RUL prediction using Bayesian formulations. In many cases, the lack of accurate physics-based models emphasizes the need to resort to machine learning based prognostic algorithms. However, data-driven methods require extensive machine failure data incorporating all possible operating conditions along with all possible failure modes pertaining to that particular machine/component, which are seldom available in their entirety. In this work, we propose a three-stage hybrid prognostic algorithm (HyA) combining model-based (Particle Filters-PF) and data-driven (Neural Networks-NN) methods in a unique way. The proposed method aims to overcome the need for accurate degradation modeling or extensive failure data sets. In the first stage, a feedforward neural network is used to formulate lithium-ion battery\u2019s degradation trends and the corresponding NN model parameters are used to define the initial prior distribution of PF algorithm. In the second stage, the PF algorithm optimizes the model parameters and the posterior model parameter distributions are utilized to \u2018\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">warm-start</i>\n\u2019 the neural network used for prognosis and the third/final stages focuses on prognosis and RUL estimation using the trained NN model leveraging on the posterior distributions of the PF fine-tuned weights and biases.

In this paper, we propose a spectrum mask based covert communication strategy in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where the overt channels are leveraged to enhance the covertness. Specifically, the legitimate IoT transmitter superimposes its own message on the overt channel to avoid being detected by the warden. We assume that proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) is adopted at the overt channel, and improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) is adopted at the legitimate transmitter to improve the covert transmission performance. To maximize the covert rate of the legitimate IoT system, a joint transmit power and IGS factor optimization problem is formulated under the constraints of covertness requirement. The metric of minimum error detection probability, that represents the worst-case for the legitimate transmitter, is utilized to measure the covertness. By exploiting the piece-wise monotonic properties of the objective function and the constraints, we derive the optimal transmit power and IGS factor pairs in both the IGS and PGS schemes. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate that the IGS scheme can improve the covert rate compared to the PGS scheme under a given covertness constraint.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3116162","startPage":"8402","endPage":"8415","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09551936.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3116162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covert Wireless Communication With Spectrum Mask in Internet of Things Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Wireless communication","Interference","Transmitters","Internet of Things","Security","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Covert communication","spectrum mask","improper Gaussian signaling","interference mitigation","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Covert Wireless Communication With Spectrum Mask in Internet of Things Networks","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9551936/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61901328"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2019M653558"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholar","grantNumber":"61825104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61631015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XJS210109"},{"fundingName":"Industry-University-Academy Cooperation Program of Xidian University-Chongqing IC Innovation Research Institute","grantNumber":"CQIRI-2021CXY-Z07"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covert Wireless Communication With Spectrum Mask in Internet of Things Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-3116162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126435S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9551936","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9551937,"authors":[{"name":"Akshay Sarin","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9551937/sarin-3116114-small.gif","p":["Akshay Sarin (Member, IEEE) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2017 and 2021, respectively.

Powering a highly connected network of devices requires multiple access and a wireless power transfer (WPT) solution that is scalable and capable of maintaining a constant power flow regardless of reconfiguration (mutability) and electromagnetic environment (power flow selectivity). In this paper, we present a framework for the implementation of code division multiple access wireless power transfer (CDMA-WPT) for enabling WPT among multiple transmitters and multiple receivers simultaneously. CDMA-WPT maintains power flow selectivity and is easily scalable. An inverter/rectifier topology is presented for the hardware implementation of CDMA-WPT. A design process for practical co-design of high-performance hardware and obtaining a code set is also presented. We demonstrate the hardware implementation of CDMA-WPT using two transmitters and two receivers maintaining a nearly constant 5W operation with nearly 75% dc-dc efficiency, and four transmitters and four receivers maintaining a constant 4W operating with greater than 70% dc-dc efficiency. This paper is accompanied by a video hardware demonstration in real-time the difference between using orthogonal codes in CDMA versus conventional single-frequency WPT using 4 transmitter-receiver pairs; conventional single-frequency WPT shows up to a 82% deviation from the intended transfer power as opposed to 8.1% for orthogonal codes in CDMA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Code Division Multiple Access Wireless Power Transfer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116114","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09551937.pdf","startPage":"135079","endPage":"135101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Code Division Multiple Access Wireless Power Transfer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9551937/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Framework for Code Division Multiple Access Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"access-sarin-3116114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.196848S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9551937","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9551953,"authors":[{"name":"M\u00e1ximo Morales-C\u00e9spedes","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Legan\u00e9s, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9551953/moral-3116246-small.gif","p":["M\u00e1ximo Morales-C\u00e9spedes (Member, IEEE) was born in Valdepe\u00f1as, Ciudad Real, Spain, in 1986.

In this sense, considering proper BIA schemes applied to each tier, tBIA fully cancels all the sources of interference. After that, the DoF outer-bound for \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-tier networks without CSIT is derived. It is shown that tBIA reaches this outer-bound. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that fully managing the inter-tier interference provides larger DoF in the whole network than turning off any tier with the aim of improving the achievable DoF in the remaining tiers. Simulation results show that the proposed tBIA scheme provides greater DoF and improves the user rates in comparison with other schemes without CSIT in multi-tier networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3116246","startPage":"8068","endPage":"8084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3116246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09551953.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Management for <i>K</i>-Tier Networks Without CSIT Based on Reconfigurable Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551953/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interference Management for <i>K</i>-Tier Networks Without CSIT Based on Reconfigurable Antennas","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9551953/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"project IRENEEARTH","grantNumber":"PID2020-115323RB-C33 / AEI / 10.13039/501100011033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006318","fundingName":"call \u201cPrograma de apoyo a la realizaci\u00f3n de proyectos interdisciplinares de I+D para j\u00f3venes investigadores de la Universidad Carlos III de Madrid 2019-2020\u201d under the frame of the Convenio Plurianual Comunidad de Madrid-Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Management for <italic>K</italic>-Tier Networks Without CSIT Based on Reconfigurable Antennas","sourcePdf":"tcomm-moralescespedes-3116246-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179066S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9551953","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9551962,"authors":[{"name":"Fulai Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Optimization and Smart Antenna, Northeastern University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Fulai","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-7888-2750"},{"name":"Kai Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0001-8773-0417"},{"name":"Zhibo Su","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zhibo","lastName":"Su","orcid":"0000-0002-1017-2223"},{"name":"Ruiyan Du","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Optimization and Smart Antenna, Northeastern University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Ruiyan","lastName":"Du"},{"name":"Aiyi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Aiyi","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-3175-8848"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9551962","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551962","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Optimization","Computational efficiency","Computational complexity","Simulation","Manganese"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Angular parameter estimation","distributed sources","compressive sensing","linear programming"]}],"abstract":"The distributed source parameter estimator (DSPE) is one of the well-known angular parameter estimation techniques for coherently distributed sources. However, the computational cost of DSPE is not attractive due to the two-dimensional spectrum peak search. To overcome this problem, this letter proposes a novel DSPE algorithm based on compressive sensing theory, named as LP-DSPE algorithm. In the proposed method, at first, the nominal direction of arrival (DOA) estimation can be transformed into a linear programming problem through sparse recovery theory, whose feasible solution set is further expanded to improve the estimation accuracy. Then the angular spread can be obtained via a one-dimensional peak search utilizing the estimated nominal DOA. Compared with the previous works, the proposed algorithm can offer more accurate parameter estimation performance with lower computational complexity, even if in large angular spread scenarios. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3116350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09551962.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"83","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3116350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LP-DSPE Algorithm for Angular Parameter Estimation of Coherently Distributed Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"LP-DSPE Algorithm for Angular Parameter Estimation of Coherently Distributed Sources","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9551962/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971117"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"F2020501007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LP-DSPE Algorithm for Angular Parameter Estimation of Coherently Distributed Sources","sourcePdf":"lcomm-tang-3116350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084431S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9551962","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9551964,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Management, Yangtze Normal University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9551964/zhu-3116480-small.gif","p":["Jianfeng Zhu received the M.S. degree in enterprise management from the School of Management, Xiamen University, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in enterprise management from the School of Business Administration, Northeastern University, China, in 2014.

Deep learning has recently boomed and applied in many fields since it is good at mapping complicated nonlinear functions based on series of artificial neural networks. In this paper, a novel image reconstruction method based on a deep neural network is proposed. The proposed image reconstruction algorithm mainly uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network, which is abbreviated as LSTM-IR algorithm. A big simulation dataset containing 160k pairs of instances is created to train and test the performance of the proposed LSTM-IR algorithm. Each pair of the sample has a predefined permittivity distribution vector and corresponding capacitance vector. The generalization ability and feasibility of the LSTM-IR network are measured using contaminated data, data not included in the training dataset, and experimental data. The preliminary results show that the proposed LSTM-IR method can create fast and more accurate ECT images than traditional and deep learning image reconstruction algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2021.3116164","startPage":"25818","endPage":"25830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3116164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9612611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/9612611/09551973.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Reconstruction in Electrical Capacitance Tomography Based on Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551973/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image Reconstruction in Electrical Capacitance Tomography Based on Deep Neural Networks","volume":"21","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/9551973/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004919","fundingName":"National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (MAARIFAH), King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia","grantNumber":"13-ELE469-10"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Reconstruction in Electrical Capacitance Tomography Based on Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-deabes-3116164-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097961S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9612611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9612611","articleId":"9551973","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9551979,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Wang","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi\u2019an, China","Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-8445-1391","id":"37086116960"},{"name":"Xiuqin Su","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi\u2019an, China","Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xiuqin","lastName":"Su","orcid":"0000-0002-6554-2762","id":"37530892300"},{"name":"Guizhong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Guizhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37281348100"},{"name":"Junfeng Han","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi\u2019an, China","Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"Han","id":"37086413159"},{"name":"Wenhua Zhu","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi\u2019an, China","Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086486720"},{"name":"Zengxin Liu","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi\u2019an, China","Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zengxin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088981749"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"9551979","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551979","abstract":"The quadrant detector (QD), has developed into a core detector in the free space optical communication system.

Most papers make theoretical studies based on elementary models, while the prototyping of RIS-aided wireless communication and real-world field trials are scarce. In this paper, we describe a new RIS prototype consisting of 1100 controllable elements working at 5.8 GHz band. We propose an efficient algorithm for configuring the RIS over the air by exploiting the geometrical array properties and a practical receiver-RIS feedback link. In our indoor test, where the transmitter and receiver are separated by a 30 cm thick concrete wall, our RIS prototype provides a 26 dB power gain compared to the baseline case where the RIS is replaced by a copper plate. A 27 dB power gain was observed in the short-distance outdoor measurement. We also carried out long-distance measurements and successfully transmitted a 32 Mbps data stream over 500 m. A 1080p video was live-streamed and it only played smoothly when the RIS was utilized. The power consumption of the RIS is around 1 W. Our paper is vivid proof that the RIS is a very promising technology for future wireless communications.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3116151","startPage":"8627","endPage":"8640","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Meta-Learning-Based Few-Shot Wireless Impersonation Detection for Wi-Fi Networks","abstract":"As the common wireless open medium of the Internet of Things (IoT), Wi-Fi networks are often suffering from impersonation attacks. For the purpose of Wi-Fi impersonation attack detection (WIAD), recently, deep learning-based techniques provide superior detection performance. However, considering the dynamics of the WIAD task, these methods require retraining deep learning network (DNN) through large-scale samples and long training time to adapt to new WIAD tasks. In this letter, we propose a meta-learning-based Wi-Fi impersonation detection (\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Meta-WF</i>\n) algorithm, which learns knowledge from historical multiple WIAD scenarios and quickly adapts to new WIAD scenarios with few-shot samples. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving 98% accuracy for new WIAD tasks by 1-step fine-tune using less than 0.1% (50-shot) of the training set samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","volume":"25","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9551984/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"<i>Meta-WF</i>: Meta-Learning-Based Few-Shot Wireless Impersonation Detection for Wi-Fi Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62072408 and 62073292"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LY20F020030"},{"fundingName":"New Century 151 Talent Project of Zhejiang Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<italic>Meta-WF</italic>: Meta-Learning-Based Few-Shot Wireless Impersonation Detection for Wi-Fi Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-hong-3112518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175401S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9610143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9610143","articleId":"9551984","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9551995,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeongjin Ann","affiliation":["Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea","CONNECT-AI Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9551995/ann-3116034-small.gif","p":["Kyeongjin Ann (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in computer science engineering from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, South Korea, in 2019.

However, in the medical field, the class-imbalanced problem is extremely common due to the differences in prevalence among diseases, making it difficult to develop these applications. Many GAN-based methods have been proposed to solve the class-imbalance problem on chest X-ray (CXR) data. However, these models have not been trained well for small-sized diseases because it is challenging to extract sufficient information with only a few pixels. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative model called a class activation region influence maximization conditional generative adversarial network (CARIM-cGAN). The proposed network can control the target disease\u2019s presence, location, and size with a controllable conditional mask. We newly introduced class activation region influence maximization (CARIM) loss to maximize the probability of disease occurrence in the bounded region represented by a conditional mask. To demonstrate an enhanced generative performance, we conducted numerous qualitative and quantitative evaluations with the samples generated using a CARIM-cGAN. The results showed that our method has a better performance than other methods. In conclusion, because the CARIM-cGAN can generate high-quality samples based on information on the location and size of the disease, we can contribute to solving problems such as disease classification, -detection, and -localization, requiring a higher annotation cost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diseases","Generators","Generative adversarial networks","Training","Computational modeling","X-ray imaging","Training data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conditional generative model","medical image augmentation","class activation map","high resolution image","nodule classification and detection","chest X-ray"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551995","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116034","startPage":"139426","endPage":"139437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09551995.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551995/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Scale Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Small-Sized Lung Nodules Using Class Activation Region Influence Maximization","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9551995/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Korea Medical Device Development Fund grant funded by Korea Government (the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety)","grantNumber":"202016B02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multi-Scale Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Small-Sized Lung Nodules Using Class Activation Region Influence Maximization","sourcePdf":"access-chang-3116034-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113301S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9551995","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":9551997,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaai Liu","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9551997/liu-3116239-small.gif","p":["Jiaai Liu received the B.E. degree in information engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2018, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, in 2020.

Each active transmitter\u2019s information bits are first channel encoded. The coded bits are divided into sub-blocks and each sub-block is modulated and transmitted. For both MIMO and massive MIMO channels, the conventional nonlinear modulation can be employed where each sub-block of coded bits is mapped to a transmitted signal vector. For the massive MIMO channel, we propose a new hybrid modulation scheme to reduce the receiver complexity, where the first sub-block is nonlinearly modulated, and the subsequent sub-blocks are linearly modulated and spread by the first sub-block signal. We also propose sparsity-exploiting blind receiver algorithms. Specifically, for the MIMO case, we exploit the codeword sparsity inherent in the UMA system, and a channel clustering technique, to estimate the channel and the transmitted signal of each transmitter. For the massive MIMO, in addition to the codeword sparsity, we further exploit the channel sparsity and user sparsity in estimating the channel and transmitted signal of each transmitter. The proposed receiver algorithms for both MIMO and massive MIMO channels output either hard or soft estimates of the coded bits, and therefore single-user channel decoding of the information bits can be performed for each transmitter. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3116239","startPage":"8055","endPage":"8067","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09551997.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3116239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-Exploiting Blind Receiver Algorithms for Unsourced Multiple Access in MIMO and Massive MIMO Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Receivers","Massive MIMO","Codes","Channel estimation","Decoding","Encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unsourced multiple access (UMA)","MIMO","massive MIMO","codeword sparsity","channel sparsity","user sparsity","orthogonal matching-pursuit (OMP)","matrix completion","clustering","soft demodulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9551997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-Exploiting Blind Receiver Algorithms for Unsourced Multiple Access in MIMO and Massive MIMO Channels","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9551997/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CCF 1814803 and SHF 7995357"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR)","grantNumber":"N000142112155"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-Exploiting Blind Receiver Algorithms for Unsourced Multiple Access in MIMO and Massive MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-3116239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072987S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9551997","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9552002,"authors":[{"name":"Wuyi Ming","affiliation":["Henan Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing of Mechanical Equipment, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, Zhengzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9552002/ming-3116131-small.gif","p":["Wuyi Ming was born in Hubei, China, in 1981.

We evaluate our approach on standard classification and part segmentation benchmarks to demonstrate competitive results compared to the prior work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552005/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21103655","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Point Transformer","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Point Transformer","sourcePdf":"access-engel-3116304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121424S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9552005","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9552008,"authors":[{"name":"Minseok Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Minseok","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0002-7490-9183"},{"name":"Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hoon","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0003-0753-8324"},{"name":"Hongju Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hongju","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-1160-5887"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0003-3701-4433"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9552008","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Cost function","Task analysis","Deep learning","Supervised learning","Neural networks","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","Sinkhorn operator","assignment problem"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Resource Assignment for Wireless Networks","abstract":"This letter studies a deep learning approach for binary assignment problems in wireless networks, which identifies binary variables for permutation matrices.

The mean vector \u00b5 has its zero and nonzero elements correspond respectively to small dense errors caused by system noise, and large sparse errors caused by discarding relatively small coefficients in sparse recovery. To suppress small errors with zero mean, one major solution is to average the recovery results of multiple dictionaries. This will linearly decrease the error's variance \u03c3\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and then enable the error taking zero value with high probability. Unfortunately, the averaging method cannot promise to decrease large errors with nonzero means. Moreover, in practice, large errors of distinct dictionaries tend to occur at the same coordinates with the same value signs, because the dictionaries learned independently tend to converge to the points close to each other and thus yield similar large errors in sparse recovery. This property prevents large errors from being decreased by average. In the paper, we prove that the average performance could be improved, if large errors of distinct dictionaries have disjoint supports.

It is commonly used in monitoring critical parts of the power plants, in aeronautics, oil and gas, and the automotive industry. Since most ultrasonic inspections rely on expert's previous experience they must constantly practice on new, unseen data. Acquiring enough data for training human experts on non-destructive ultrasonic scan analysis can be an expensive and time-consuming task. The only possibility to get new data for practicing is to implant synthetic defects in real metal blocks. Artificial defects are made by temperature strain, electrical discharge, and physical damage. All of those methods are very complicated and expensive to perform. Also metal blocks have to be taken from the components of the power plants to have the same structure and be realistic. In this work, some attempts have been made to generate 3D ultrasonic scans using computer vision and deep learning methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552069/","accessionNumber":"21201431","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9552069/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synthetic 3D Ultrasonic Scan Generation Using Optical Flow and Generative Adversarial Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"KK.01.2.1.01.0151"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic 3D Ultrasonic Scan Generation Using Optical Flow and Generative Adversarial Networks","confLoc":"Zagreb, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0045-0055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076196S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9552029","isNumber":"9552037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9552029","xplore-issue":"9552037","articleId":"9552069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9552074,"authors":[{"name":"Jednipat Atiwetsakun","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering King Mongkut's, University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Jednipat","lastName":"Atiwetsakun","id":"37088980724"},{"name":"Santitham Prom-on","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering King Mongkut's, University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Santitham","lastName":"Prom-on","id":"38275116900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2841-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2842-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9552074","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Correlation","Big Data","Transformers","Tokenization","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attention","Deep learning","word segmentation","Thai language"]}],"abstract":"Word segmentation is an important preprocessing step in natural language processing applications, particularly in languages with no demarcation indicators including Thai. A simple method like dictionary-based segmentation does not consider the context of the sentence. This paper proposes an attention-based deep learning approach for Thai word segmentation. With the help of attention, the model can learn character correlations across the entire sentence without gradient vanishing or gradient explode problems and tokenize them into word vectors. The goal of this research is to test three different types of attention mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of word tokenization. The visualization of attention for each attention mechanism is also included as an outcome.","doi":"10.1109/IBDAP52511.2021.9552074","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Practices (IBDAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Practices (IBDAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9552030/9552031/09552074.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IBDAP52511.2021.9552074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9552031","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thai Tokenization with Attention Mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thai Tokenization with Attention Mechanism","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552074/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552074/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thai Tokenization with Attention Mechanism","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1570746014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055462S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9552030","isNumber":"9552031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9552030","xplore-issue":"9552031","articleId":"9552074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9552078,"authors":[{"name":"Bhuvan Mittal","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, USA"],"firstName":"Bhuvan","lastName":"Mittal","id":"37088982475"},{"name":"IungHwan Oh","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, USA"],"firstName":"IungHwan","lastName":"Oh","id":"37088981107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2639-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2640-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1849-2266"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1845-5921"}],"articleNumber":"9552078","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Image segmentation","Computed tomography","Computational modeling","Lung","Signal processing","Semisupervised learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Covid-19","medical imaging","segmentation","disease severity quantification","deep learning","machine learning","lung computed tomography (CT) scan"]}],"abstract":"The Covid-19 is a highly contagious and virulent disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Over 175 million cases and 3.8 million deaths were reported worldwide as of June 2021. Covid-19 disease induces lung changes observed in lung Computerized Tomography (CT) predominantly as ground-glass opacification (GGO) with occasional consolidation in the peripheries. It was revealed in some literature that 88% of Covid-19 positive patients' CT scans showed GGO and 32% showed consolidation. Moreover, it was reported that the percentage of the lung showing GGO, and consolidation is tied to disease severity. Thus, segmentation of ground-glass opacities and consolidations in CT images will help to quantify disease severity and assist physicians in disease triage, management, and prognosis. In this paper, we propose CoviSegNet, an enhanced U-Net model to segment these ground-glass opacities and consolidations. The performance of CoviSegNet was evaluated on three public CT datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed CoviSegNet is highly promising.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CoviSegNet - Covid-19 Disease Area Segmentation using Machine Learning Analyses for Lung Imaging","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","doi":"10.1109/ISPA52656.2021.9552078","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9552029/9552037/09552078.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA52656.2021.9552078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9552037","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"CoviSegNet - Covid-19 Disease Area Segmentation using Machine Learning Analyses for Lung Imaging","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9552078/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CoviSegNet - Covid-19 Disease Area Segmentation using Machine Learning Analyses for Lung Imaging","confLoc":"Zagreb, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0018-0001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089711S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9552029","isNumber":"9552037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9552029","xplore-issue":"9552037","articleId":"9552078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9552089,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe J.

Convolutional Neural Network with Squeeze-and-Excitation Modules for Efficient Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Sensors","abstract":"Human activity recognition (HAR) relying on wearable sensors has become a new challenging area of research in pervasive and ubiquitous computing due to the rapid advancements in sensor technology. Since several deep learning (DL) networks have been introduced to handle the problem of feature extraction in machine learning, these techniques have recently garnered considerable attention. Nevertheless, most recent DL networks utilize sensory data by automatically extracting spatial properties without addressing cross-channel data at the same level. This information from each sensor channel was independently conveyed in a hierarchical method from shallow levels to deeper levels. This paper introduces SE-DeepConvNet, a lightweight deep convolutional neural network with squeeze-and-excitation modules for recognizing human activity from smartphone sensor data. The recommended SE-DeepConvNet was developed and assessed on the UCI-HAR dataset, a public benchmark HAR dataset. According to the results obtained, the SE-DeepConvNet outperforms other baseline DL networks with a maximum accuracy of 99.27%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552111/","accessionNumber":"21201629","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9552111/","publicationDate":"26 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Squeeze-and-Excitation Modules for Efficient Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Squeeze-and-Excitation Modules for Efficient Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Sensors","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1570747786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0854S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9552030","isNumber":"9552031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9552030","xplore-issue":"9552031","articleId":"9552111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9552113,"authors":[{"name":"Mani Sharifi","affiliation":["Distributed Systems & Multimedia Processing Laboratory (DSMP lab), Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Dr. Mani Sharifi is a post-doctoral research fellow at both DSMP and RRMR Lab at Ryerson University.

We use mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) mathematical model to find the optimal task scheduling and compare it with the performance of the FIFO online scheduling strategies for a fog computing sample that consists of n edge processors (EP) and one cloud processor. The MILP mathematical dispatching strategy optimizes the jobs' scheduling on the EPs and cloud processors. Finally, solving the model and simulation of more scenarios is presented to compare the performance of the optimized job scheduling model with two FIFO scenarios for a real-time application on fog computing.

In this paper, we perform Emergency Siren Detection with a Convolutional Neural Network-based deep learning model. We investigate acoustic features to propose a low computational cost algorithm. We employ Short-Time Fourier Transform spectrograms as features and improve the classification performance by applying a harmonic percussive source separation technique. The enhancement of the harmonic components of the spectrograms gives better results than more computationally complex features. We also demonstrate the relevance of the siren harmonic contents in the classification task. The reduction of the network hyperparameters decreases the computational load of the algorithm and facilitates its implementation in real-time embedded systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9552037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA52656.2021.9552140","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9552029/9552037/09552140.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"53","doi":"10.1109/ISPA52656.2021.9552140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic Features for Deep Learning-Based Models for Emergency Siren Detection: An Evaluation Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic Features for Deep Learning-Based Models for Emergency Siren Detection: An Evaluation Study","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552140/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","accessionNumber":"21201438","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552140/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009883","fundingName":"Marche Region","grantNumber":"B28I19000330007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic Features for Deep Learning-Based Models for Emergency Siren Detection: An Evaluation Study","confLoc":"Zagreb, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0017-0047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138792S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9552029","isNumber":"9552037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9552029","xplore-issue":"9552037","articleId":"9552140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9552170,"authors":[{"name":"Nadezhda Koriakina","affiliation":["Centre for Image Analysis, Uppsala University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nadezhda","lastName":"Koriakina","orcid":"0000-0002-2891-5435","id":"37086250515"},{"name":"Nata\u0161a Sladoje","affiliation":["Centre for Image Analysis, Uppsala University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nata\u0161a","lastName":"Sladoje","orcid":"0000-0002-6041-6310","id":"37064092000"},{"name":"Joakim Lindblad","affiliation":["Centre for Image Analysis, Uppsala University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Lindblad","orcid":"0000-0001-7312-8222","id":"37270617800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2639-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2640-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1849-2266"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1845-5921"}],"articleNumber":"9552170","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Memory management","Signal processing","Reliability","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","sampling methods","supervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised learning","biomedical imaging","instance level attention weights","inference","bag-level sampling","end-to-end attention-based MIL method","end-to-end multiple instance learning","within-bag sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Instance Learning","sampling","deep learning","attention","interpretability","memory management"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552170","doi":"10.1109/ISPA52656.2021.9552170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA52656.2021.9552170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9552037","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9552029/9552037/09552170.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Within-Bag Sampling on End-to-End Multiple Instance Learning","abstract":"End-to-end multiple instance learning (MIL) is an important concept with a wide range of applications. It is gaining increased popularity in the (bio)medical imaging community since it may provide a possibility to, while relying only on weak labels assigned to large regions, obtain more fine-grained information. However, processing very large bags in end-to-end MIL is problematic due to computer memory constraints. We propose within-bag sampling as one way of applying end-to-end MIL methods on very large data. We explore how different levels of sampling affect the performance of a well-known high-performing end-to-end attention-based MIL method, to understand the conditions when sampling can be utilized. We compose two new datasets tailored for the purpose of the study, and propose a strategy for sampling during MIL inference to arrive at reliable bag labels as well as instance level attention weights. We perform experiments without and with different levels of sampling, on the two publicly available datasets, and for a range of learning settings. We observe that in most situations the proposed bag-level sampling can be applied to end-to-end MIL without performance loss, supporting its confident usage to enable end-to-end MIL also in scenarios with very large bags.

Our proposed system consists of multiple narrow-angle light-emitting diode (LED)/photodiode (PD) elements at the source, near user, and far user. In order to achieve communication, our system selects a single LED/PD at each node. We propose several low complexity LED/PD selection schemes that aim to maximize the link throughput and in addition consider optimal and random LED/PD selection for benchmarking. In order to characterize the performance of each scheme, bounds and closed-form tight approximations on the average achievable sum rates are presented. The use of multi element nodes and NOMA increase the average sum rate significantly over conventional orthogonal access. Moreover, near-optimal throughput can be achieved using channel gain based and line-of-sight based LED/PD selection schemes in the medium-to-high transmit power regimes. The derived expressions are also useful to investigate the impact of key system and channel parameters such as the source transmit power, power allocation factor, node placement, and the number of elements at each node.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average Rate Analysis of Cooperative NOMA Aided Underwater Optical Wireless Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3116146","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09552193.pdf","startPage":"2292","endPage":"2310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3116146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Average Rate Analysis of Cooperative NOMA Aided Underwater Optical Wireless Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9552193/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Average Rate Analysis of Cooperative NOMA Aided Underwater Optical Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-palitharathna-3116146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1345S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9552193","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9552332,"authors":[{"name":"Leonid Filins'kyy","affiliation":["Oles Honchar Dnipro National University, Dnipro, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Filins'kyy","id":"37973994100"},{"name":"Maksym Potapov","affiliation":["Oles Honchar Dnipro National University, Dnipro, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Maksym","lastName":"Potapov","id":"37088982788"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0102-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0101-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0103-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3593"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2165-3585"}],"articleNumber":"9552332","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"abstract":"A device is proposed for measuring the characteristics of reflection from foams, homogeneous dielectrics and other radio-absorbing materials in the form of flat-layered structures.

In this proposed architecture, multiple signals are encoded with othogonal Walsh-Hadamard (WH) codes and multiplexed into a single channel. The combined signal is fed into a single Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) at the digital baseband, leading to significant reduction in size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C). As a result, the hardware complexity of the receiver is reduced by more than 95 %. A key challenge addressed in this paper is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation due to inter-channel interference. Interference is greatly dependent on the choice of the employed orthogonal WH codes. In this paper, we introduce methods to achieve greater than 30 dB inter-channel interference rejection across a bandwidth of 400 MHz. As such, the proposed reduced SWaP-C and interference mitigation can have a major impact in realizing innovations for the 28-GHz and beyond mmWave links.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/USNC-URSIRSM52661.2021.9552370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9552336","startPage":"064","endPage":"068","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 USNC-URSI Radio Science Meeting (USCN-URSI RSM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9552335/9552336/09552370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power and Low Cost Millimeter-Wave Digital Beamformer Using An Orthogonal Coding Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552370/","displayDocTitle":"Low Power and Low Cost Millimeter-Wave Digital Beamformer Using An Orthogonal Coding Scheme","conferenceDate":"9-13 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"9 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power and Low Cost Millimeter-Wave Digital Beamformer Using An Orthogonal Coding Scheme","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"906.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054897S","chronDate":"9-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9552335","isNumber":"9552336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9552335","xplore-issue":"9552336","articleId":"9552370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9552382,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Wei","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Wei","orcid":"0000-0003-4032-5996"},{"name":"Jun Yan","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center of Communications and Networking, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yan","orcid":"0000-0001-7113-0249"},{"name":"Xiaofu Wu","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center of Communications and Networking, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofu","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-9861-331X"},{"name":"Chen Wang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-8317-1785"},{"name":"Gengxin Zhang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Gengxin","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-7962-6695"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9552382","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Training","Data preprocessing","Generative adversarial networks","Convolutional neural networks","Generators","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-free localization","WiFi","fingerprint","channel state information (CSI)","generative adversarial network (GAN)","multimodal"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data Preprocessing Method for Deep Learning-Based Device-Free Localization","abstract":"Deep learning models are widely used in the field of Device-Free Localization (DFL), and their performances rely heavily on the labeled dataset. In this letter, a novel data preprocessing method is proposed for exploiting the full potential of a collected dataset in DFL. Firstly, we propose to employ a pix-level multimodal representation of radio images for a fusion of both amplitude and phase features from Channel State Information (CSI). Then, a novel Conditional Generative Adversarial Network with Auxiliary Classifier (AC-GAN) model is used to generate artificial samples for further expanding the collected dataset. We further employ a regression formulation to train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for positioning. The experimental results show that using the proposed method gains approximately 18% Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) improvement over the CSI amplitude-only method and 22% over the CSI phase-only method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3116150","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3116150","startPage":"3868","endPage":"3872","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09552382.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552382/","displayDocTitle":"A Data Preprocessing Method for Deep Learning-Based Device-Free Localization","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552382/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771256 and 91738201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data Preprocessing Method for Deep Learning-Based Device-Free Localization","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wu-3116150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061683S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9552382","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9552386,"authors":[{"name":"Weihong Yang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Weihong","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0003-4981-0381"},{"name":"Yang Qin","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Qin","orcid":"0000-0002-1981-1423"},{"name":"Zhangchengzhe Yi","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhangchengzhe","lastName":"Yi"},{"name":"Xuan Wang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-3512-0649"},{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-2486-5765"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9552386","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Topology","TCPIP","Synchronization","Routing","Renewable energy sources","Publishing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cache consistency","edge caching","ICN-based IoT","push communication paradigm"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing Cache Consistency Guarantee for ICN-Based IoT Based on Push Mechanism","abstract":"This letter develops POPCache (POpularity-aware Push-based Cache), a cache management strategy to support cache consistency in ICN-based IoT.

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar technology is known to achieve high performance sensing by probing with multiple orthogonal waveforms. However, implementing a low cost low power MIMO radar is challenging. One of the reasons for this difficulty stems from the increased cost and power consumption required by analog-to-digital convertors (ADCs) in acquiring the multiple waveforms at the radar receiver. In this work we study reduced cost MIMO radar receivers restricted to operate with low resolution ADCs. We design bit-limited MIMO radar (BiLiMO) receivers which are capable of accurately recovering their targets while operating under strict resolution constraints. This is achieved by applying an additional analog filter to the acquired waveforms, and designing the overall hybrid analog-digital system to facilitate target identification using task-based quantization methods. In particular, we exploit the fact that the target parameters can be recovered from a compressed representation of the received waveforms. We thus tune the acquisition system to recover this representation with minimal distortion, from which the targets can be extracted in digital, and characterize the achievable error in identifying the targets. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BiLiMO receiver operating with a bit budget of one bit per sample achieves target recovery performance which approaches that of costly MIMO radars operating with unlimited resolution ADCs, while substantially outperforming MIMO receivers operating only in the digital domain under the same bit limitations.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09552445.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3116343","startPage":"6267","endPage":"6282","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3116343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"BiLiMO: Bit-Limited MIMO Radar via Task-Based Quantization","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"69","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552445/","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Benoziyo Endowment Fund"},{"fundingName":"Estate of Olga Klein \u2013 Astrachan"},{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research, and innovation","grantNumber":"646804-ERC-COG-BNYQ"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"0100101"},{"fundingName":"Futurewei Technologies"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571228"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BiLiMO: Bit-Limited MIMO Radar via Task-Based Quantization","sourcePdf":"tsp-xi-3116343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123553S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9552445","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9552448,"authors":[{"name":"Yiyang Shu","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Semiconductor and Integrated Micro-System, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9625642/9552448/shu-3113555-small.gif","p":["Yiyang Shu (Member, IEEE) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in microelectronics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2016 and 2021, respectively.","His research interests include the integrated wideband microwave/millimeter-wave/terahertz oscillator and frequency synthesizer.","Dr. Shu was a recipient/co-recipient of the IEEE International Symposium on Radio frequency Integration Technology (RFIT) Student Design Competition Award in 2016, the IEEE International Microwave Symposium (IMS) Student Design Competition Award in 2018, the IEEE International Wireless Symposium (IWS) Best Student Paper Award in 2018, the 2020\u20132021 IEEE Solid-State Circuits (SSC)-Society Predoctoral Achievement Award, the 2020 IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques (MTT)-Society Graduate Fellowship Award, the 2020 Chinese Institute of Electronics Integrated Circuit Scholarship (Grand Prize), and the IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium (RFIC) Best Student Paper Award in 2021.

The common-mode (CM) resonances around the second harmonic and the differential-mode (DM) resonances around the third harmonic are utilized to suppress the flicker noise up-conversion and achieve harmonic shaping. Meanwhile, the dual-resonance response expands the high-impedance frequency ranges around the harmonics, and thus, the effect of harmonic shaping can be obtained over a wide frequency range. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS process, the oscillator measured exhibits low phase noise and high FoM simultaneously with a compact chip size.

This trend has prompted demand for low-power, high-performance information processing on the edge side. Here, an Ising model architecture that can efficiently solve optimization problems would be an efficient processing solution for edges. In this study, we implemented a 512- spin fully connected Ising model on an LSI chip fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process. The fully connected Ising model was implemented in the chip by using pseudo-annealing (PA), which is easier to implement than simulated annealing (SA). In addition, we devised a multi-spin-thread structure, concurrent update structure, and a folded interaction placement for accuracy, speed, and compactness. Because eight spin threads are implemented, the calculation throughput could be increased by a factor of eight in comparison with a single spin-thread implementation. Moreover, as a measure of solution accuracy, the average route length of a 22-city traveling salesman problem was reduced by 19% and the standard deviation (SD) was reduced by 46%. Likewise, the average cut value of a 512- node max-cut problem was increased by 1.6% and SD was decreased by 60%. The concurrent update almost doubled the calculation speed in comparison with the case of no concurrent update. In addition, the circuit area was reduced by about 38% as a result of the folded interaction placement. The time required to obtain a solution was 128 ms. The chip at annealing processing (main processing) had a power consumption of 12 mW at 1 MHz.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3114422","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3114422","startPage":"5061","endPage":"5071","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09552452.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552452/","displayDocTitle":"Annealing Processing Architecture of 28-nm CMOS Chip for Ising Model With 512 Fully Connected Spins","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552452/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Annealing Processing Architecture of 28-nm CMOS Chip for Ising Model With 512 Fully Connected Spins","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kawahara-3114422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06424S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9552452","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9552454,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob M.

Chaotic sensing is one such methodology that employs deterministic, fractal sampling in conjunction with finite, iterative reconstruction schemes to form an image from limited samples. Using a sampling pattern constructed entirely from periodic lines in DFT space, chaotic sensing was found to outperform traditional compressed sensing for magnetic resonance imaging; however, only one such sampling pattern was presented and the reason for its fractal nature was not proven. Through the introduction of a novel image transform known as the kaleidoscope transform, which formalises and extends upon the concept of downsampling and concatenating an image with itself, this letter: (1) demonstrates a fundamental relationship between multiplication in modular arithmetic and downsampling; (2) provides a rigorous mathematical explanation for the fractal nature of the sampling pattern in the DFT; and (3) leverages this understanding to develop a collection of novel fractal sampling patterns for the 2D DFT with customisable properties. The ability to design tailor-made fractal sampling patterns expands the utility of the DFT in chaotic imaging and may form the basis for a bespoke chaotic sensing methodology, in which the fractal sampling matches the imaging task for improved reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3116510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09552454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3116510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","startPage":"2053","endPage":"2057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bespoke Fractal Sampling Patterns for Discrete Fourier Space via the Kaleidoscope Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bespoke Fractal Sampling Patterns for Discrete Fourier Space via the Kaleidoscope Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552454/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552454/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000925","fundingName":"National Health and Medical Research Council","grantNumber":"APP113986"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bespoke Fractal Sampling Patterns for Discrete Fourier Space via the Kaleidoscope Transform","sourcePdf":"lsp-white-3116510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083708S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9552454","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9552473,"authors":[{"name":"Parisa Karimi","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Parisa","lastName":"Karimi","orcid":"0000-0003-3724-8723","id":"37085651644"},{"name":"Zhizhen Zhao","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhizhen","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0003-3594-5840","id":"37089001529"},{"name":"Mark D.

The desired results of FH require correct identity and photorealistic image quality, however, developing a method that satisfies both requirements remains challenging. Although the lifelike faces predicted by some existing methods, such as PULSE, are impressive, the loss of original identity is unacceptable. In view of the deficiency of PULSE, in this letter we incorporate a conditional constraint to its unsupervised pixel recovery process. Specifically, we embed a PULSE generator within the Laplacian pyramid framework and install a corresponding pre-trained conditional adversarial net (CGAN) at each pyramid level to predict the difference between the reconstructed SR image obtained by PULSE and the ground truth. The difference is added to the reconstructed SR image at each level to obtain a new SR image that is closer to the ground truth, such a process is repeated across the subsequent levels until a full-resolution version is yielded. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our architecture can obtain a realistic high-resolution (HR) face with a correct identity, which is not possible obtained by other FH methods before.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Level Difference Repair Architecture for Face Hallucination","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3116507","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09552496.pdf","startPage":"2048","endPage":"2052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3116507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Level Difference Repair Architecture for Face Hallucination","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9552496/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003009","fundingName":"Science and Technology Development Fund","grantNumber":"0016/2019/A1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Level Difference Repair Architecture for Face Hallucination","sourcePdf":"lsp-wong-3116507-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091355S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9552496","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9552498,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixuan Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Future IC Technology and Science, School of Integrated Circuit, Peking University, Beijing, China","Advanced Institute of Information Technology, Peking University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9583614/9552498/zwang-3113257-small.gif","p":["Zhixuan Wang (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from the College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China, in 2016, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2021.","In 2021, he joined Beijing Laboratory of Future IC Technology and Science, School of Integrated Circuit, Peking University, as a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant.

To significantly reduce the long-term average (LTA) power consumption and realize multiapplication and intelligent event detection, three techniques are proposed: 1) In a three-stage pipelined event-driven architecture, a frame generator and a convolutional neural network intelligent inference engine (CNN IIE) in stage III are event-driven by the preliminary detectors in stage II, and the detectors are triggered by a level-crossing (LC) analog-to-digital converter (ADC), i.e., stage I, dramatically reducing the overall power consumption. 2) The clock-free pulse-based instant rate of change (IROC) feature extractor directly processes the asynchronous pulses of the LC-ADC outputs in the temporal domain instead of utilizing a conventional power-hungry frequency-domain method. 3) A reconfigurable IROC, the frame generator, and the CNN IIE provide adaptive intelligence for various IoT events, enhancing the accuracy of multipurpose detection with ultralow power.

Many recent studies optimize loss functions defined solely in the time or complex domain, without including a loss on magnitude. Although such loss functions typically produce better scores if the evaluation metrics are objective time-domain metrics, they however produce worse scores on speech quality and intelligibility metrics and usually lead to worse speech recognition performance, compared with including a loss on magnitude. While this phenomenon has been experimentally observed by many studies, it is often not accurately explained and there lacks a thorough understanding on its fundamental cause. This letter provides a novel view from the perspective of the implicit compensation between estimated magnitude and phase. Analytical results based on monaural speech separation and robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks in noisy-reverberant conditions support the validity of our view.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3116502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09552504.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3116502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","startPage":"2018","endPage":"2022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Compensation Between Magnitude and Phase in Speech Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Compensation Between Magnitude and Phase in Speech Separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552504/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Compensation Between Magnitude and Phase in Speech Separation","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-3116502-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13252S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9552504","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9552516,"authors":[{"name":"Yilun Xu","affiliation":["1Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8924785/9347847/9552516/xu-3116540-small.gif","p":["Yilun Xu received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in engineering physics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2018, respectively.","Since 2018, he has been with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA.

To tackle this challenge and keep pace with rapidly evolving classical control requirements, full control stack access is essential to system-level optimization. We design a modular field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based system called QubiC to control and measure a superconducting quantum processing unit. The system includes room temperature electronics hardware, FPGA gateware, and engineering software. A prototype hardware module is assembled from several commercial off-the-shelf evaluation boards and in-house-developed circuit boards. Gateware and software are designed to implement basic qubit control and measurement protocols.

The optimal resolution may vary significantly depending on the dataset. Modern CNNs hard-code their resolution hyper-parameters in the network architecture which makes tuning such hyper-parameters cumbersome. We propose to do away with hard-coded resolution hyper-parameters and aim to learn the appropriate resolution from data. We use scale-space theory to obtain a self-similar parametrization of filters and make use of the N-Jet: a truncated Taylor series to approximate a filter by a learned combination of Gaussian derivative filters.

While many such networks can upscalelow-resolution (LR) images using just the raw pixel-level information, the ill-posed nature of SR can make it difficult to accurately super-resolve an image which has undergone multiple different degradations. Additional information (metadata) describing the degradation process (such as the blur kernel applied, compression level, etc.) can guide networks to super-resolve LR images with higher fidelity to the original source. Previous attempts at informing SR networks with degradation parameters have indeed been able to improve performance in a number of scenarios. However, due to the fully-convolutional nature of many SR networks, most of these metadata fusion methods either require a complete architectural change, or necessitate the addition of significant extra complexity. Thus, these approaches are difficult to introduce into arbitrary SR networks without considerable design alterations. In this letter, we introduce meta-attention, a simple mechanism which allows any SR CNN to exploit the information available in relevant degradation parameters. The mechanism functions by translating the metadata into a channel attention vector, which in turn selectively modulates the network's feature maps. Incorporating meta-attention into SR networks is straightforward, as it requires no specific type of architecture to function correctly. Extensive testing has shown that meta-attention can consistently improve the pixel-level accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks when provided with relevant degradation metadata. Despite average memory/runtime overheads of less than \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\approx$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n2.6%/0.025 seconds for the datasets and models considered, meta-attention improves the performance for both PSNR and SSIM; for PSNR, the gain onblurred/downsampled (\u00d74) images is of 0.2969 dB (on average) and 0.3320 dB for SOTA general and face SR models, respectively.

The key is fully exploring the spatial-temporal context. This letter proposes a Focusing-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (FDGCN) to address this issue. Each skeleton frame is first decomposed into two opposite-direction graphs for subsequent focusing and diffusion processes. Next, the focusing process generates a spatial-level representation for each frame individually by an attention module. This representation is regarded as a supernode to aggregate the feature from each joint node in each frame for spatial context extraction. After generating supernodes for the entire sequence, a transformer encoder layer is proposed to capture the temporal context further. Finally, these supernodes pass the embedded spatial-temporal context back to the spatial joints through the diffusion graph in the diffusing process. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D and Skeleton-Kinetics benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3116513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09552599.pdf","startPage":"2058","endPage":"2062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3116513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skeleton-Based Action Recognition With Focusing-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552599/","displayDocTitle":"Skeleton-Based Action Recognition With Focusing-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Networks","volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9552599/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Cloudwalk Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772513"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skeleton-Based Action Recognition With Focusing-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"lsp-gao-3116513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120656S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9552599","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9552620,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9552620/zhao-3116309-small.gif","p":["Zhibin Zhao received the B.S. degree (Hons.) and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2015 and 2020, respectively.","He was a Visiting Ph.D. Student in AI for healthcare with The University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., from 2019 to 2020.

However, machines often operate with various working conditions, or the target task has different distributions with the collected data used for training (the domain shift problem). Besides, the newly collected test data in the target domain are usually unlabeled, leading to unsupervised deep transfer learning (UDTL)-based IFD problem. Although it has achieved huge development, a standard and open source code framework and a comparative study for UDTL-based IFD are not yet established. In this article, we construct a new taxonomy and perform a comprehensive review of UDTL-based IFD according to different tasks. Comparative analysis of some typical methods and datasets reveals some open and essential issues in UDTL-based IFD, which is rarely studied, including transferability of features, the influence of backbones, negative transfer, physical priors, and so on. To emphasize the importance and reproducibility of UDTL-based IFD, the whole test framework will be released to the research community to facilitate future research. In summary, the released framework and comparative study can serve as an extended interface and basic results to carry out new studies on UDTL-based IFD.

The memory industry has already adopted monolithic 3-D integration (e.g., in 176-layer 3-D NAND Flash), while the 3-D vertical integration structure of logic transistors (e.g., 3-D stacked nanosheets, NMOS on top of PMOS) is emerging for sub-3-nm logic nodes. The other trend is to stack the embedded nonvolatile memories [e.g., resistive random access memory (RRAM), phase change memory (PCM), magnetic random access memory (MRAM), and ferroelectric field-effect-transistor (FeFET)] on top of CMOS using the back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing. Taking one step further, the integration of multiple tiers of active transistors with embedded memories is expected to offer significant improvements in the throughput and energy efficiency thanks to the massive connectivity between logic and memories. Besides the technological breakthroughs, circuit design automation methodologies have become key enablers to optimize the tier partitioning in monolithic 3-D architectures. In addition, heat dissipation should be taken care of by accurate thermal modeling in these monolithic 3-D architectures. New heat spreading materials and advanced embedded cooling techniques are also important.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2021","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","publicationDate":"June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552630/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Special Topic on Monolithic 3-D Integration for Energy-Efficient Computing","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Special Topic on Monolithic 3-D Integration for Energy-Efficient Computing","sourcePdf":"jxcdc-yu-3111236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029425S","chronDate":"June  2021","xplore-pub-id":"6570653","isNumber":"9548857","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570653","xplore-issue":"9548857","articleId":"9552630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9552654,"authors":[{"name":"Kainan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA"],"firstName":"Kainan","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Zhi Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Tian"},{"name":"Zhipeng Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA"],"firstName":"Zhipeng","lastName":"Cai"},{"name":"Daehee Seo","affiliation":["National Center of Excellence in Software, Sangmyung University, Seoul 03016, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Daehee","lastName":"Seo"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"9552654","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Social networking (online)","Training","Adversarial machine learning","Decoding","Topology","Differential privacy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["graph embedding","privacy preservation","adversarial learning"]}],"abstract":"The inefficient utilization of ubiquitous graph data with combinatorial structures necessitates graph embedding methods, aiming at learning a continuous vector space for the graph, which is amenable to be adopted in traditional machine learning algorithms in favor of vector representations. Graph embedding methods build an important bridge between social network analysis and data analytics, as social networks naturally generate an unprecedented volume of graph data continuously. Publishing social network data not only brings benefit for public health, disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other applications, but also gives birth to threats that jeopardize each individual's privacy and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in publishing social graph embedding data only focus on preserving social graph structure with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited from social networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence of a sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a predictive model with the exposed social network embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding framework using adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's prediction accuracy on sensitive links, while persevering sufficient non-sensitive information, such as graph topology and node attributes in graph embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework using ground truth social network datasets.","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971803/9552649/09552654.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link-privacy preserving graph embedding data publication with adversarial learning","doi":"10.26599/TST.2021.9010015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9552649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.26599/TST.2021.9010015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2022","displayDocTitle":"Link-privacy preserving graph embedding data publication with adversarial learning","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","publicationDate":"April 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Link-privacy preserving graph embedding data publication with adversarial learning","sourcePdf":"244256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015372S","chronDate":"April  2022","isNumber":"9552649","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","articleId":"9552654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9552834,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Tasdighi","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, CNRS UMR 6285, Universit\u00e9 Bretagne-Sud, Lorient, France"],"bio":{"p":["Alireza Tasdighi received the M.A.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in information/coding theory from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, in 2016.

This is because GaN-on-GaN has a higher thermal conductivity of the GaN epitaxial layer and a lower thermal boundary resistance than GaN-on-SiC. Next, the thermal design of a 400-W/eight-channel selective heating microwave oven, which consists of eight pairs of patch antennas and power amplifier (PA) modules, involving a 50-W-class GaN-on-GaN HEMT PA, a driving amplifier, an oscillator, and several circuits, was carried out. The fan and fin specifications and enclosure configuration have been optimized to keep the temperature of the metal base on which the PA modules are mounted below 40 \u00b0C during full operation.

Despite its central importance, an account that is both physically grounded and applicable to a broad class of problems and amenable to yielding closed-form expressions including timing jitter is lacking. We consider an optical-pulse train produced by an active- or hybrid-mode-locked laser with timing jitter originating in both the locking oscillator and the mode-locked laser. Our focus is on the power spectral density of a stationary random signal generated by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process sampled by the mode-locked laser. Based on an analytically tractable theoretical treatment, we find conditions under which the power spectral density of the sampled signal maintains reasonable fidelity with the original within the signal bandwidth and elucidate the r\u00f4les of the departure from periodicity in the sampling and the effect of the timing jitter on the sampled signal on the degradation of the PSD due to timing jitter.

The decentralized edge computing process handles the task at the user\u2019s end to accomplish latency applications, but recent research adopted centralized methodologies for computing in the edge network, placing additional overhead for cluster management and grouping. In this paper, we formulate an edge nodes group on task arrivals with a decentralized technique to process jobs, in a parallel mode, to complete execution. In addition, high availability will be added to promise effective processing of IoT based applications executed in the edge computing system. In the edge node environment, where resources are restricted, there is a requirement for high availability methods, which can deliver system reliability according to the local device information, without the data of network topology. In this paper, our technique is to enhance network reliability with the help of the edge node\u2019s local information, which is executed in the distributed edge computing network, while also proposing a high availability technique to enhance the overall IoT environment. Our proposed Latency Aware Algorithm for Edge Computing with High Availability (LAAECHA) detects edge nodes faults, repairs edge nodes and replaces edge nodes with backups, using a new algorithm in a decentralized mode. Our research results show that the proposed LAAECHA method is more effective than existing methods, ensuring latency-aware IoT applications achieve their deadlines, while significantly reducing network traffic as well as guaranteeing system availability and reliability of the IoT network.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09552858.pdf","startPage":"138994","endPage":"139008","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decentralized Edge Computing Latency-Aware Task Management Method With High Availability for IoT Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Edge computing","Internet of Things","Task analysis","Fault tolerant systems","Reliability","Fault tolerance","Servers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge computing","distributed computing","Internet of Things","fault tolerance","high availability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Decentralized Edge Computing Latency-Aware Task Management Method With High Availability for IoT Applications","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9552858/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Decentralized Edge Computing Latency-Aware Task Management Method With High Availability for IoT Applications","sourcePdf":"access-bukhsh-3116717-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121069S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9552858","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9552861,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","International College of Semiconductor Technology, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9552861/lu-3116611-small.gif","p":["Wei Lu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Dong Hwa University (NDHU), Hualien, Taiwan, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan.

Fortunately, 3D-SRAM cubes by TSV 3D-stacking technologies provide promising solutions and become feasible for on-device DNN accelerators. In this paper, a flexible interconnect architecture, 3D cross-ring, and an efficient dataflow are proposed with 3D-SRAM cubes for an energy-efficient hybrid-DNN accelerator.

By applying varying symbol rates, the set of possible transmission rate pairs enlarges and we can reach higher data rates compared to existing modulation and coding schemes (MCS). We also propose an algorithm to efficiently find the rate pairs. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that NOMA with a varying symbol rate not only can reach higher data rates than orthogonal schemes such as time division multiple access, but it can also outperform existing MCS-based methods which have a fixed symbol rate. The experiments also show that there is a noticeable gap between NOMA in theory and practice. In addition to the new NOMA experiments, we review the state-of-the-art in experimental NOMA.

In TEP, optimal number of new transmission lines and their installation time and place are determined in an economic way. Uncertainties in load demand, place of power plants, and fuel price as well as voltage level of substations influence TEP solutions effectively. Therefore, in this paper, a scenario based-model is proposed for evaluating the fuel price impact on TEP considering the expansion of substations from the voltage level point of view. The fuel price is an important factor in power system expansion planning that includes severe uncertainties. This factor indirectly affects the lines loading and subsequent network configuration through the change of optimal generation of power plants. The efficiency of the proposed model is tested on the real transmission network of Azerbaijan regional electric company using a discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) and quadratic programming (QP) based method. Moreover, discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) and decimal codification genetic algorithm (DCGA) methods are used to verify the results of the DABC algorithm. The results evaluation reveals that considering uncertainty in fuel price for solving TEP problem affects the network configuration and the total expansion cost of the network. In this way, the total cost is optimized more and therefore the TEP problem is solved more precisely. Also, by comparing the convergence curve of the DABC with that of DPSO and DCGA algorithms, it can be seen that the efficiency of the DABC is more than DPSO and DCGA for solving the desired TEP problem.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Planning","Costs","Fuels","Substations","Voltage","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DABC","static TEP (STEP)","uncertainty in fuel price","network losses","expansion of substations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552867","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116802","startPage":"135983","endPage":"135995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09552867.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552867/","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Expansion Planning Considering Power Losses, Expansion of Substations and Uncertainty in Fuel Price Using Discrete Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9552867/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)-Finance","grantNumber":"001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the Project Energy Systems Integration Partnership Program (ESIPP)","grantNumber":"SFI/15/SPP/E3125"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Transmission Expansion Planning Considering Power Losses, Expansion of Substations and Uncertainty in Fuel Price Using Discrete Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm","sourcePdf":"access-alhelou-3116802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093554S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9552867","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9552874,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Nasser","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9552874/nasse-3116706-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Nasser (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electronics and communications engineering from Suez Canal University, Egypt, in 2012, the M.Sc. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Egypt-Japan University for Science and Technology (E-JUST), Egypt, in 2016, and the dual Ph.D. degree from Kyushu University, Japan, and E-JUST, in 2020.

The EE and SE tradeoff is modeled as a multi-objective problem (MOP) under the maximum power and quality of service (QoS) constraints, which is non-convex. The MOP is relaxed into a convex single objective problem (SOP) by adopting a weighted sum strategy with the hypograph transformation. The SOP is solved in two steps. In the first step, we propose a power allocation technique based on non-cooperative (NC) game for EE and SE in NOMA HetNets. In the proposed NC game, the macro base station (MBS) and the small BSs (SBSs) compete with an equal priority in order to optimize their transmit powers towards maximizing the weighted sum of SE and EE. In the second step, a closed-form formula is proposed to control the power allocated to users while taking into account both QoS constraint and successive interference cancellation (SIC) condition. From simulations, the proposed technique can, in some dedicated settings, considerably improve the tradeoff between EE and SE over conventional techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09552874.pdf","startPage":"136334","endPage":"136345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Cooperative Game Based Power Allocation for Energy and Spectrum Efficient Downlink NOMA HetNets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Games","Interference","Quality of service","Resource management","Power control","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous networks (HetNets)","energy efficiency (EE)","spectrum efficiency (SE)","interference mitigation","power control (PC)","non-cooperative (NC) game"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Non-Cooperative Game Based Power Allocation for Energy and Spectrum Efficient Downlink NOMA HetNets","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9552874/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006091","fundingName":"Support Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology Research Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP17K06427"},{"fundingName":"Research Project \u201cSuper-HETs, Empowering 5G HetNets for better Performance\u201d funded by the National Telecom Regulatory Authority (NTRA) Egypt"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004096","fundingName":"Kyushu University Platform of Inter/Transdisciplinary Energy Research (Q-PIT)"},{"fundingName":"Suez Canal University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-Cooperative Game Based Power Allocation for Energy and Spectrum Efficient Downlink NOMA HetNets","sourcePdf":"access-nasser-3116706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101695S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9552874","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9552877,"authors":[{"name":"Givanildo L.

Our algorithm identifies the sensor data behavior through the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane and performs data reduction by removing redundant data without losing the system\u2019s properties.

Thus, we determine when to update the sampling period to maximize the system\u2019s information content, i.e., the statistical complexity quantifier. To confirm the sampling adaptability, we apply our method in three different chaotic attractors: Rossler, Lorenz, and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${B}_{7}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n.

We use the K-S test, the average Data Error, and the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane to compare the results. Using our sampling approach, we observed K-S test distances less than 3% for chaotic maps and 1% for natural environments data. The best results were in the Data Error, showing an average error rate up to 13.4% lower when evaluating chaotic data and 15.7% lower when evaluating natural environments. Regarding the dispersion of points in the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane, the sampled time-series reached regions of higher statistical complexity, indicating that they preserved information content, hence the original data\u2019s dynamics.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9612611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3116548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/9612611/09552877.pdf","startPage":"25831","endPage":"25842","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2021.3116548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Sampling Algorithm Based on Complexity-Entropy Plane for Smart Sensing Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data Sampling Algorithm Based on Complexity-Entropy Plane for Smart Sensing Applications","volume":"21","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/9552877/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Council for Scientific and Technological Development\u2013Brazil (CNPq)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003401","fundingName":"Research Support Foundation of the State of Alagoas\u2013Brazil (FAPEAL)","grantNumber":"60030.0000000352/2021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Sampling Algorithm Based on Complexity-Entropy Plane for Smart Sensing Applications","sourcePdf":"jsen-nascimentojr-3116548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089087S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9612611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9612611","articleId":"9552877","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9552882,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Xu","affiliation":["Cybersecurity Laboratory, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9552882/xu-3116612-small.gif","p":["Wen Xu received the master\u2019s degree in information science from Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand.

With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), there has been a number of Autoencoder (AE) based deep learning approaches for network anomaly detection to improve our posture towards network security. The performance of existing state-of-the-art AE models used for network anomaly detection varies without offering a holistic approach to understand the critical impacts of the core set of important performance indicators of AE models and the detection accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel 5-layer autoencoder (AE)-based model better suited for network anomaly detection tasks. Our proposal is based on the results we obtained through an extensive and rigorous investigation of several performance indicators involved in an AE model. In our proposed model, we use a new data pre-processing methodology that transforms and removes the most affected outliers from the input samples to reduce model bias caused by data imbalance across different data types in the feature set. Our proposed model utilizes the most effective reconstruction error function which plays an essential role for the model to decide whether a network traffic sample is normal or anomalous. These sets of innovative approaches and the optimal model architecture allow our model to be better equipped for feature learning and dimension reduction thus producing better detection accuracy as well as f1-score. We evaluated our proposed model on the NSL-KDD dataset which outperformed other similar methods by achieving the highest accuracy and f1-score at 90.61% and 92.26% respectively in detection.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09552882.pdf","startPage":"140136","endPage":"140146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Performance of Autoencoder-Based Network Anomaly Detection on NSL-KDD Dataset","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552882/","displayDocTitle":"Improving Performance of Autoencoder-Based Network Anomaly Detection on NSL-KDD Dataset","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9552882/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Cyber Security Research Programme\u2014Artificial Intelligence for Automating Response to Threats from the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) of New Zealand as a part of the Catalyst Strategy Funds","grantNumber":"MAUX1912"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Improving Performance of Autoencoder-Based Network Anomaly Detection on NSL-KDD Dataset","sourcePdf":"access-xu-3116612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073049S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9552882","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9552894,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Lin","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Lin","orcid":"0000-0002-8416-2335"},{"name":"Jiajia Chen","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jiajia","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-6989-9048"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9552894","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information-theoretic security based on quantum mechanics. Integrating QKD with classical data traffic by using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) techniques in a single fibre is a cost-efficient way to improve security in legacy infrastructure. In such a system, the main noise source to the quantum channel is spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) caused by the classical channels. In this letter we introduce a channel allocation strategy for both quantum and classical signals to minimize the SRS noise. A use case that quantum and classical channels co-exist in a dense WDM system is investigated. The results show >26% increase of achievable transmission distance for the QKD system when implementing the introduced channel allocation strategy. Moreover, a network updating plan is proposed, which provides a guideline to light the new wavelengths for classical communications while minimizing the SRS noise to quantum channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Minimizing Spontaneous Raman Scattering for QKD Secured DWDM Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3116755","endPage":"3921","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09552894.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"3918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3116755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552894","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum channels","Benchmark testing","Resource management","WDM networks","Encryption","C-band","Raman scattering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical fibre communication","optical communication network","quantum key distribution (QKD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Minimizing Spontaneous Raman Scattering for QKD Secured DWDM Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552894/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9552894/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001729","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"Celtic-Plus sub-project PROTECT"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"Vinnova, Genie project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002835","fundingName":"Chalmers University of Technology Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Minimizing Spontaneous Raman Scattering for QKD Secured DWDM Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-lin-3116755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04417S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9552894","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9552896,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Yang","affiliation":["School of Wireless Communication Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-6016-2472"},{"name":"Qiuyun Zou","affiliation":["School of Wireless Communication Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiuyun","lastName":"Zou","orcid":"0000-0001-8187-8920"},{"name":"Hongwen Yang","affiliation":["School of Wireless Communication Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongwen","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-7541-8474"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9552896","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Message Passing Based Calculation of MI and MMSE Matrix for Massive MIMO Systems With Finite-Alphabet Inputs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational complexity","Monte Carlo methods","Approximation algorithms","Mutual information","Message passing","Closed-form solutions","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mutual information","minimum mean-square error","approximate message passing","finite-alphabet inputs"]}],"abstract":"Under finite-alphabet inputs, the mutual information (MI) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) matrix have no closed-form solutions, and numerical integrations, e.g., Monte Carlo simulation, endure prohibitive computational burden for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

There remains a clear need for accurate air temperature prediction at the suburban scale at high temporal and spatial resolutions. This research proposed a framework based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning network to generate day-ahead hourly temperature forecasts with high spatial resolution. Air temperature observations are collected at a very fine scale (~150m) along major roads of New York City (NYC) through the Internet of Things (IoT) data for 2019-2020. The network is a stacked two layer LSTM network, which is able to process the measurements from all sensor locations at the same time and is able to produce predictions for multiple future time steps simultaneously. Experiments showed that the LSTM network outperformed other traditional time series forecasting techniques, such as the persistence model, historical average, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and feedforward neural networks (FNN). In addition, historical weather observations are collected from in situ weather sensors (i.e., Weather Underground, WU) within the region for the past five years. Experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the LSTM network with different training datasets: 1) IoT data alone, or 2) IoT data with the historical five years of WU data. By leveraging the historical air temperature from WU, the LSTM model achieved a generally increased accuracy by being exposed to more historical patterns that might not be present in the IoT observations. Meanwhile, by using IoT observations, the spatial resolution of air temperature predictions is significantly improved.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116809","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09552907.pdf","startPage":"137406","endPage":"137418","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Internet of Things (IoT) for Localized Surface Temperature Forecasting in an Urban Environment","topic":"Deep Learning for Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Internet of Things (IoT) for Localized Surface Temperature Forecasting in an Urban Environment","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21176116","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552907/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment Seed Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Internet of Things (IoT) for Localized Surface Temperature Forecasting in an Urban Environment","sourcePdf":"access-yu-3116809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085065S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","topics":["Deep Learning for Internet of Things"],"articleId":"9552907","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9552908,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Cao","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Cao","orcid":"0000-0002-8439-7142"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-9817-3473"},{"name":"Peng Ran","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ran","orcid":"0000-0001-6419-480X"},{"name":"Dazhong He","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dazhong","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0002-1895-0122"},{"name":"Gang He","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0003-4964-8871"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9552908","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACCsiNet: Asymmetric Convolution-Based Autoencoder Framework for Massive MIMO CSI Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Kernel","Decoding","Training","Massive MIMO","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CSI feedback","massive MIMO","aysmmetric convolution","lightweight neural network","multi-model fusion"]}],"abstract":"Channel state information (CSI) is a critical part for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system.

On the other hand, data owners (users) may not want to reveal data information to cloud providers to protect their privacy. Therefore, users may upload encrypted data to the cloud or third-party platforms, such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Service, and Microsoft Azure. Conventionally, data must be decrypted before being analyzed in the cloud, which raises privacy concerns. Moreover, decryption of big data such as images requires enormous computation resources, which is unsuitable for energy-constrained devices, particularly Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Data privacy in most popular applications, such as image query or classification, can be preserved if encrypted images can be directly classified on the cloud or IoT devices without decryption. This paper proposes a high-speed double random phase encoding (DRPE) technique of encrypting images into white-noise images. DRPE-encrypted images are then uploaded and stored in the cloud. Images that are encrypted without being decrypted are classified using deep convolutional neural networks in the cloud. The simulation results indicated the feasibility and good performance of the proposed approach. The proposed privacy-preserving image classification method can be useful in data-sensitive fields, such as medicine and transportation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552911/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21126864","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Image Classification With Deep Learning and Double Random Phase Encoding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean Government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"2020R1A2C3006234"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Privacy-Preserving Image Classification With Deep Learning and Double Random Phase Encoding","sourcePdf":"access-moon-3116876-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187809S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9552911","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9552915,"authors":[{"name":"Raed Alsurdeh","affiliation":["School of Computer, Data and Mathematical Sciences, Western Sydney University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9552915/alsur-3116716-small.gif","p":["Raed Alsurdeh received the master\u2019s degree in computer science and information system from the Arab Academy for Banking and Financial Sciences University, in 2007.

The framework consists of three steps, including resource estimation, resource provisioning, and workflow scheduling. In the resource estimation stage, the number of resources and time to run the workflow are estimated under task execution constraints, including deadline, throughput, and waiting time. Accordingly, workflow tasks are formulated in execution groups. Next, the required computation nodes at the edge cloud system are provisioned to host the execution of these groups. Two types of resources are involved, namely, public clouds and edge nodes.

The main challenge of this combination is the differentiation of service quality constraints between batch and stream computations. Stream processing is highly latency-sensitive while batch processing is more likely resource-intensive. In this work, we propose an end-to-end hybrid workflow scheduling on an edge cloud system as a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we propose a resource estimation algorithm based on a linear optimization approach, gradient descent search (GDS), and in the second stage, we propose a cluster-based provisioning and scheduling technique for hybrid workflows on heterogeneous edge cloud resources. We provide a multi-objective optimization model for execution time and monetary cost under constraints of deadline and throughput. Results demonstrate the framework performance in controlling the execution of hybrid workflows by efficiently tuning several parameters including stream arrival rate, processing throughput, and workflow complexity. In comparison to a meta-heuristics technique using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the proposed scheduler provides significant improvement for large-scale hybrid workflows in terms of execution time and cost with an average of 8% and 35%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09552915.pdf","startPage":"134783","endPage":"134799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Workflow Scheduling on Edge Cloud Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552915/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Workflow Scheduling on Edge Cloud Computing Systems","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9552915/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Hybrid Workflow Scheduling on Edge Cloud Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"access-alsurdeh-3116716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131714S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9552915","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9552916,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086543204"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["CNIC, CAS, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38026660700"},{"name":"Chi-Wing Fu","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Wing","lastName":"Fu","id":"37336329800"},{"name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","affiliation":["University Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Daniel","lastName":"Fekete","id":"37407972900"},{"name":"Yunhai Wang","affiliation":["Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Yunhai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085804605"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"9552916","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Sampling methods","Coherence","Reservoirs","Scalability","Visual analytics","Rivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scatterplots","sampling","pyramid","progressive visualization","streaming visualization","scalability","big data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552916","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9663056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/9663056/09552916.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pyramid-based Scatterplots Sampling for Progressive and Streaming Data Visualization","abstract":"We present a pyramid-based scatterplot sampling technique to avoid overplotting and enable progressive and streaming visualization of large data.

We minimize the average power consumption of the BS due to wirelessly charging under the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for uplink users. Based on this, the downlink/uplink beamforming, downlink/uplink time allocation, and uplink multiuser power control are jointly designed. The non-convex problem is first solved with fixed time allocation and uplink receive beamforming via a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach, based on which an iterative algorithm is proposed for updating the optimal time allocation and the receive beamforming. The feasibility condition and the equivalence condition between the original and relaxed problems are analyzed. Simulation results show that the average charging power consumption of the BS is significantly reduced compared with a heuristic scheme that adopts the average user channel gain as energy beamforming in the downlink and exhausts the harvested energy for multiuser power control with zero-forcing (ZF) receive beamforming in the uplink.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552932/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Charging Power Minimization in Multiuser Wireless-Powered Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 109-2221-E-008-056 and MOST 110-2221-E-008-037"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Charging Power Minimization in Multiuser Wireless-Powered Networks","sourcePdf":"access-ku-3116580-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10363S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9552932","onlineDate":"29 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9552950,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Tai Yan","affiliation":["Office of Research and Development, Tainan National University of the Arts, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9594522/9552950/yan-3113918-small.gif","p":["Jin-Tai Yan (Member, IEEE) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer and information science from National Chiao-Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1988, 1990, and 1995, respectively.","From 1999 to 2019, he was a Faculty Member with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chung-Hua University, Hsinchu.

In this article, given a set of nets including some inter-chip or through-silicon buses between chips and package, inside a silicon interposer, a via-avoidance-oriented routing algorithm can be proposed to minimize the number of the used layers by satisfying the noncrossing constraint between two nets and the constraint of using no via on the inter-chip sub-nets and no vertical detour on the through-silicon sub-nets in multiple-layer interposer routing. The routing process in our proposed algorithm can be divided into two sequential steps: iterative routing step and refinement step. In the iterative routing step, the routing process of all the given nets can be completed for layer minimization in a top-down layer-by-layer manner. In each iteration, based on the definition of the obstacle-aware routing pattern for the inter-chip sub-net on one given net, the assignment of the obstacle-aware routing patterns can be firstly obtained in single-layer routing. Furthermore, the routing paths of some inter-chip sub-nets and the partial or full routing paths of some through-silicon sub-nets can be assigned and routed onto the available layer by using a maze routing process under the detour constraints. In the refinement step, based on the routing result of the given nets on the used layers, the detoured inter-chip or through-silicon sub-nets can be firstly reassigned and rerouted for the detour reduction of the given nets. Furthermore, a set of zigzag paths can be inserted onto some nets inside the given inter-chip or through-silicon buses for skew minimization. Compared with the combination of the iterative routing using Cadence\u2019s automatic router and the detouring-path insertion on the number of the used layers, the experimental results show that our proposed routing algorithm can use reasonable CPU time and shorter wirelength to decrease 19.3% of the number of the used layers for eight tested examples on the average.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9594522/09552950.pdf","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3113918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3113918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Via-Avoidance-Oriented Interposer Routing for Layer Minimization in 2.5-D IC Designs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Silicon","Integrated circuits","Pins","Minimization","Metals","Costs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2.5-D integrated circuit (IC) designs","interposer routing","layer minimization","via avoidance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Via-Avoidance-Oriented Interposer Routing for Layer Minimization in 2.5-D IC Designs","volume":"29","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9552950/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Via-Avoidance-Oriented Interposer Routing for Layer Minimization in 2.5-D IC Designs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yan-3113918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084948S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9594522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9594522","articleId":"9552950","onlineDate":"30 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9552953,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Sengupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08550 USA.

While \u2018silicon photonics\u2019 has demonstrated the path towards such advancements in the IR regime, the field of VIS/NIR integrated optics has seen less progress. Therefore, while currently ultra high-density and higher performance image sensors are commonplace in CMOS, all passive optical components (such as lenses, filters, gratings, collimators) that typically constitute a high-performance sensing or imaging system, are typically non-integrated, bulky and expensive, severely limiting their application potential in the space of connected sensors. Here, we present an approach to utilize the embedded copper-based metal interconnect layers in modern CMOS processes with sub-wavelength feature sizes to realize multi-functional nano-optical structures and components. Based on our prior works, we illustrate this electronic-photonic co-design approach exploiting metal/light interactions and integrated electronics in the 400nm-900 nm wavelengths with three design examples. Realized in 65-nm CMOS, these demonstrate for the first time: fully integrated multiplied fluorescence based biosensors with integrated filters, optical spectrometer, and CMOS optical physically unclonable function (PUF). These examples cover a range of optical processing elements in silicon, from deep sub-wavelength nano-optics to diffractive structures. We will demonstrate that when co-designed with embedded photo-detection and signal processing circuitry, this approach can foster millimeter-scale, intelligent optical sensors for a wide range of emerging applications in healthcare, diagnostics, smart sensing, food, air quality, environment monitoring and others.","doi":"10.1109/OJSSCS.2021.3116563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782712/9530264/09552953.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJSSCS.2021.3116563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9530264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visible and Near-IR Nano-optical Components and Systems in CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Visible and Near-IR Nano-optical Components and Systems in CMOS","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000148","fundingName":"Division of Electrical Communications and Cyber Systems"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Visible and Near-IR Nano-optical Components and Systems in CMOS","sourcePdf":"ojsscs-3116563-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070156S","isNumber":"9530264","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782712","articleId":"9552953","onlineDate":"30 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":9552961,"authors":[{"name":"Benedikt Schweizer","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9171629/9562119/9552961/schwe-3110164-small.gif","p":["Benedikt Schweizer (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Ulm University, Ulm, Germany, in 2016.","From 2014 to 2015, he interned with Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA.

While a lot of research has been carried out for interference between different modulation schemes, the mechanisms of interference from OFDM to OFDM radars have been barely addressed. This paper provides a thorough analysis of mutual OFDM to OFDM interference based on radar measurements using a 4x4 77\u2009GHz multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM radar prototype. The effects of interference are described both qualitatively and quantitatively for cyclic-prefix and stepped-carrier OFDM. Second, it is shown that conventional mitigation methods in the spectrogram are not suitable due to the random coding of cyclic-prefix OFDM. As an alternative, the application of adaptive beamforming is proposed and two realization possibilities are provided. Finally, new mitigation strategies in the modulation domain are proposed. They allow to shape interference to specific range-Doppler cells, yielding an interference-free range-velocity map for the area of interest. Additionally, the method may be used as the basis to enable simple conventional interference mitigation strategies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Interference of Automotive OFDM Radars\u2014Analysis and Countermeasures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Microwaves","doi":"10.1109/JMW.2021.3110164","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Microwaves","pdfPath":"/iel7/9171629/9562119/09552961.pdf","startPage":"950","endPage":"961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMW.2021.3110164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Interference of Automotive OFDM Radars\u2014Analysis and Countermeasures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9552961/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research","grantNumber":"16EMO0345"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Mutual Interference of Automotive OFDM Radars\u2014Analysis and Countermeasures","sourcePdf":"jmw-schweizer-3110164-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117473S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"9171629","isNumber":"9562119","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9171629","xplore-issue":"9562119","articleId":"9552961","onlineDate":"30 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9552967,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"9552967","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552967","abstract":"These instructions give guidelines for preparing papers for this publication.

While dealing with complex tasks, deep learning adopts a number of transformation stages to deliver the in-depth description and interpretation of the data. Deep learning achieves exceptional power and flexibility by learning to represent the task through a nested hierarchy of layers, with more abstract representations formed successively in terms of less abstract ones. One of the key issues of existing deep learning approaches is that the meaningful representations can be learned only when their hyperparameter settings are properly specified beforehand, and general parameters are learned during the training process. Until now, not much research has been dedicated to automatically set the hyperparameters, and accurately find the globally optimal general parameters. However, this problem can be formulated as optimization problems, including discrete optimization, constrained optimization, large-scale global optimization, and multiobjective optimization, by engaging mechanisms of evolutionary computation.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/9552966/09552976.pdf","startPage":"810","endPage":"814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9552966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2021.3096336","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2021.3096336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guest Editorial Evolutionary Computation Meets Deep Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9552976/","displayDocTitle":"Guest Editorial Evolutionary Computation Meets Deep Learning","isDynamicHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9552976/","volume":"25","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guest Editorial Evolutionary Computation Meets Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"tevc-ding-3096336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024107S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"9552966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","xplore-issue":"9552966","articleId":"9552976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9553004,"authors":[{"name":"Seok Young Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seok Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"37088800866"},{"name":"Chang Hyun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Chang Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086877539"},{"name":"Seon Wook Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seon Wook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279297600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3553-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2957-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9553004","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Graphics processing units","Computer architecture","Speech recognition","Parallel processing","Hardware","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent Neural Networks","Floating-point MAC unit","Bfloat16","Long Short-Term Memory"]}],"abstract":"The characteristics of recurrent and functional reduction in RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) may cause an inefficient execution in conventional hardware such as CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). Their large number of recurrent data prevents the CPU from exploiting their locality, while the reduction feature limits the GPU parallelism. As a result, several dedicated hardware for efficient RNN execution has been proposed recently. In this paper, we propose a processing element that performs primary operations (i.e., multiplication and accumulation operation and activation function operation) of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), the most dominant model of RNN We implemented the processing element on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) and verified the accuracy by measuring the BLEU score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy score) of the PyTorch-based LSTM application. It was decreased by 2.3% compared to the CPU result.","doi":"10.1109/ITC-CSCC52171.2021.9553004","publicationTitle":"2021 36th International Technical Conference on Circuits/Systems, Computers and Communications (ITC-CSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 36th International Technical Conference on Circuits/Systems, Computers and Communications (ITC-CSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9501257/9501258/09553004.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITC-CSCC52171.2021.9553004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9501258","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Pipelined Adder Tree for Long Short-Term Memory Cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Pipelined Adder Tree for Long Short-Term Memory Cells","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2021","xploreNote":"This article was mistakenly omitted from the original submission to IEEE Xplore.

This paper proposes a decentralized computation offloading scheme where a user does not require information about other users and about the MEC network (e.g., number of servers, network topology). Under the proposed computation offloading scheme, a user infers the transmission delay from the link rate assigned by its associated base station (BS). Further, each user privately deploys a moving average model to estimate the network delay after transmission. Using such information and its own information (i.e., local computing resource and energy availability), the user decides whether to offload its task to the MEC network via the BS. In case, a user decides to offload its task then the task deadline is not revealed to the MEC network to maintain fairness. Thereafter, the central controller of the MEC network performs optimal task allocation and notification of the computation results to the users. The impact of various user-parameters such as task generation probability, deadline, task size and processing density on the users and the MEC network are analyzed using extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9553007","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555400/9553005/09553007.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9553007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Computation Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Computation Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","htmlLink":"/document/9553007/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Computation Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570738400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093124S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555400","isNumber":"9553005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555400","xplore-issue":"9553005","articleId":"9553007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9553013,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Boni","affiliation":["University of Parma, Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9684154/9553013/boni-3112342-small.gif","p":["Andrea Boni (Member, IEEE) received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information technologies from the University of Parma, Italy, in 1993 and 1997, respectively.

The modulator targets healthcare and medical diagnostic applications where the readout of small-bandwidth signals is required. The design of the proposed A/D converter was optimized to achieve the minimum power consumption and area. A remarkable performance improvement is obtained through the integration of a low-noise amplifier with modified Miller compensation and rail-to-rail output stage. The manuscript also presents a set of design equations, from the small-signal analysis of the amplifier, for an easy design of the modulator in different technology nodes. The Sigma-Delta converter achieves a measured 96-dB dynamic range, over a 250-Hz signal bandwidth, with an oversampling ratio of 500.

Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays an important role for oil spill detection with its advantage of wide coverage and all-weather observations. However, discriminating whether the dark formations in the SAR imagery are from actual oil spills or look-alikes has been a challenging part. This study applied You Only Look Once version 4 (YOLOv4) object detection algorithm as an one-class (i.e. oil spill) object detector for learning oil spill features inside the Region of Interests (ROIs) and the background information from the rest of the image. The preliminary results pointed out that the pixel threshold for removing some tiny oil spills is suggested as they appeared regularly in the study area but are hardly visible. The average precisions (AP) of the trained model on validation and test sets are 67.80% and 65.37%, showing that the model is not overfitting on our training and validation sets. In addition, this study recommended some data augmentation strategies which might help improve the

Nevertheless, most of them cannot meet what we expect when the numbers of labeled samples are small. Also, due to the rectangular convolution kernels, the long-range context information within HSIs is cannot fully be explored. To solve these problems, we propose a semi-supervised method based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). First, HSIs are over segmented into various superpixels and GCN is employed for mining the advanced spectral features. Second, we input the obtained spectral features to the Bi-LSTM model for exploring global spatial features. Due to the diverse receptive fields, the short-and long-range spatial relations can be discovered simultaneously. Finally, we map the features from region-level to pixel-level for classifying HSIs. The positive experimental results counted on two HSIs demonstrate that our method is superior to some popular methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9553035/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Spectral Graph and Bidirectional LSTM Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801351"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M620441"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Spectral Graph and Bidirectional LSTM Network","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0003661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063492S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9553050,"authors":[{"name":"Xianghai Wang","affiliation":["School of Geography, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China","School of Computer and Information Technology, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xianghai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293616500"},{"name":"Chengdi Xing","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Chengdi","lastName":"Xing","id":"37088468943"},{"name":"Yining Feng","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yining","lastName":"Feng","id":"37088992430"},{"name":"Ruoxi Song","affiliation":["School of Geography, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Ruoxi","lastName":"Song","id":"37086526926"},{"name":"Zhenhua Mu","affiliation":["School of Geography, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Mu","id":"37088427116"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553050","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Geoscience and remote sensing","Transforms","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Data mining","Hyperspectral imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral image","Change detection","3D-Wavelet transform","Active learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553050","abstract":"Change detection techniques of hyperspectral images(HSI) has witnessed great improvements with the applications of deep convolutional networks (CNN).

Then, to enhance the change discrimination ability of the primary features, the directional subbands are concatenated from coarse to fine scales to form the initial 3D-Wavelet feature map. In the conventional implementation, active learning strategy is iteratively adopted to extract the deep features of the constructed feature map, in each active learning round, the most informative unlabeled samples will be selected to enlarge the training set, which greatly reduces the labor of annoteing data.

The deep neural networks (DNN) extract visual features using numerous techniques, including convolutional and pooling layers, residual modules, inception modules, neural architecture search, and attention networks. Researchers have increasingly found that DNN are biased towards texture, and that this bias is a deficiency that when corrected, can boost classification and detection performance of deep learners. A morphology-based network utilizing the differential morphological profile (DMP) as a non-parametric feature extraction layer, known as DMPNet, was proposed with promising results when compared to VGG16. In this work, the original DMPNet is expanded with increased profile depth, as well as alternate convolutional phases, such as ResNet-18 and MobileNet. The resulting architecture shows an ability to increase shape information in the network, and with it, generalizability on high resolution remote sensing imagery.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553057","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553057.pdf","startPage":"2823","endPage":"2826","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Classification of High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery with Differential Morphological Profile Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Improved Classification of High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery with Differential Morphological Profile Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9553057/","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Classification of High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery with Differential Morphological Profile Neural Network","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061831S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9553067,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088758589"},{"name":"Xiaohui Wei","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086520276"},{"name":"Xudong Kang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Kang","id":"38252233200"},{"name":"Puhong Duan","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Puhong","lastName":"Duan","id":"37086421776"},{"name":"Shutao Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shutao","lastName":"Li","id":"37279618700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553067","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"abstract":"It is well known that classification accuracy highly relies on the number of labeled samples. However, it is difficult to obtain sufficient labeled samples in real-world applications. To solve this issue, a novel hyperspectral image (HSI) classification method based on polygonal partition is proposed for crop mapping. This method only needs single sample per class as an initial training set. Specifically, multiscale polygonal partition is applied on the first three components of the HSI. Then, a spectral similarity-based sample expansion method is proposed to obtain more labeled samples. Next, a pixel-wise classifier, the support vector machine (SVM), is used to acquire an initial classification result. Finally, classification result is further optimized according to the partition maps. Experimental results show that classification performance of the proposed method is satisfactory even when the number of labeled sample is single for each class.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Support vector machines","Crops","Geoscience and remote sensing","Feature extraction","Hyperspectral imaging","Image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polygonal partition-based hyperspectral image classification","single labeled sample","classification accuracy","sufficient labeled samples","novel hyperspectral image classification method","HSI","multiscale polygonal partition","spectral similarity-based sample expansion method","initial classification result","partition maps","classification performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral image classification","sample expansion","polygonal partition","single sample","crop mapping"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553067","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553067.pdf","startPage":"3225","endPage":"3228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polygonal Partition-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification with Single Labeled Sample","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polygonal Partition-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification with Single Labeled Sample","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553067/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9553067/","accessionNumber":"21227414","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61890962,61601179"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polygonal Partition-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification with Single Labeled Sample","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0003225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054175S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9553088,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The proposed EDLAD aims to simultaneously alleviate anomaly contamination and build a stable background component for anomaly detection. To reduce anomaly contamination, the EDLAD first utilizes a well-designed encoder-decoder LSTM to reconstruct the hyperspectral image. Based on the concept that the anomaly pixels occupy an extremely small fraction of the image, the well-designed encoder-decoder LSTM network tends to maintain the background and alleviate anomaly during the reconstruction process since the whole image is employed for training the network. Then the dimension reduction is used to further alleviate the anomaly contamination and build a stable background component. Finally, the EDLAD applies the Mahalanobis distance differences to detect the probable anomalies. The experiments on two benchmark hyperspectral images demonstrate the superiority of the EDLAD in anomaly detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EDLAD: An Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory Network-Based Anomaly Detector for Hyperspectral Images","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553145","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553145.pdf","startPage":"4412","endPage":"4415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"EDLAD: An Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory Network-Based Anomaly Detector for Hyperspectral Images","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553145/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Technology Research and Development Program/National Key R & D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFA0605500,2018AAA0101100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61822113"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013091","fundingName":"Science and Technology Major Project of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2019AEA170"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EDLAD: An Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory Network-Based Anomaly Detector for Hyperspectral Images","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059603S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9553161,"authors":[{"name":"Helgi Hrafn Omarsson","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Helgi Hrafn","lastName":"Omarsson","id":"37088993331"},{"name":"Qian Du","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Du","id":"37267187900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553161","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Feature extraction (FE) can greatly improve classification performance, when dealing with hyperspectral imagery (HSI) which is notable by its high dimensionality. Unsupervised FE methods have proven to perform competitively in this arena. Preprocessing methods have been used to further improve their performance. One such an approach to improving FE for classification of HSI is investigated in this paper. This approach is based on exploiting the intermediate nature of spectral signatures transformed via fractional fourier transform (FrFT) as the result from the transform, which carry information from both the original reflectance spectral domain and its fourier transfer domain. The fractional discrete cosine transform (FrDCT) is also investigated for the same purposes. Pairing these methods involved with dimensionality reduction, with a well-known FE algorithm, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), is explored. Results obtained with a real hyperspectral dataset are promising with preprocessing based on selecting an appropriate fractional transform order, low-pass (LP) filtering in the fractional domain to an appropriate degree, followed by the PCA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553161.pdf","startPage":"2743","endPage":"2746","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification by Fractional Discrete Cosine Transform Based Feature Extraction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dimensionality reduction","Reflectivity","Feature extraction","Iron","Discrete cosine transforms","Tuning","Spectral analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification by Fractional Discrete Cosine Transform Based Feature Extraction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553161/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification by Fractional Discrete Cosine Transform Based Feature Extraction","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048181S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9553218,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Martins","affiliation":["Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, UFMS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Martins","id":"37087092195"},{"name":"Keiller Nogueira","affiliation":["University of Stirling, Stirling, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Keiller","lastName":"Nogueira","id":"37085455723"},{"name":"Pedro Zamboni","affiliation":["Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, UFMS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Zamboni","id":"37088993611"},{"name":"Paulo Tarso Sanches de Oliveira","affiliation":["Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, UFMS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Paulo Tarso Sanches","lastName":"de Oliveira","id":"37088989900"},{"name":"Wesley Nunes Gon\u00e7alves","affiliation":["Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, UFMS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Wesley Nunes","lastName":"Gon\u00e7alves","id":"37949709100"},{"name":"Jefersson A. dos Santos","affiliation":["Federal University of Minas Gerais, UFMG, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jefersson A.","lastName":"dos Santos","id":"37085446897"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Marcato","affiliation":["Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, UFMS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Marcato","id":"37087089914"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553218","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553218","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Image segmentation","Urban areas","Semantics","Neural networks","Vegetation","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semantic Segmentation","Deep Learning","Remote sensing","Urban environment","Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553218","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553218.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","startPage":"6932","endPage":"6935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of Tree Canopies in Urban Environments Using Dilated Convolutional Neural Network","abstract":"Object detection and image segmentation are essential for environmental monitoring.

Still, there are advances to perceive and questions on how to get the optimal performance and improve the results. With this aim, we assessed a state-of-the-art CNN, the Dynamic Dilated Convolution Neural Network (DDCN), to segment trees inside an urban environment. We chose DDCN because it exploits the paradigm of multi-context without increasing the number of trainable parameters of the network and defines, while training, the best patch size that should be used by the network in the test phase, helping to tune the CNN. With this technique, we achieved: pixel accuracy of 95.86%; average accuracy of 90.63%; F1-score of 90.93%; Kappa index of 81.87% and IoU of 72.78%. We are showing the capabilities of this CNN to segment complex images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553218/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553218/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of Tree Canopies in Urban Environments Using Dilated Convolutional Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"CNPq","grantNumber":"303559/2019-5,433783/2018-4,304173/2016-9"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"CAPES","grantNumber":"88881.211850/2018-01,001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005672","fundingName":"Fundect","grantNumber":"59/300.066/2015,59/300.095/2015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of Tree Canopies in Urban Environments Using Dilated Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0006932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043102S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9553233,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhui Zhao","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China","Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Advanced Marine Communication and Information Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chunhui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37287524500"},{"name":"Chuang Li","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China","Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Advanced Marine Communication and Information Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Li","id":"37088532078"},{"name":"Shou Feng","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China","Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Advanced Marine Communication and Information Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shou","lastName":"Feng","id":"37088432598"},{"name":"Nan Su","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China","Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Advanced Marine Communication and Information Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Su","id":"37085594830"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553233","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"abstract":"Without any prior information of anomalies or background, hyperspectral anomaly detection has received a wide attention. However, such unsupervised style brings difficulties in training and learning effective features of hyperspectral image to perform detection. This paper proposes a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithm using bilateral-filtered generative adversarial networks (BFGAN). Bilateral filter can smooth images and remove anomalous points while preserving edges. With closeness weights and similarity weights, the bilateral-filtered hyperspectral image can be considered as background data, so that hyperspectral background labels are obtained. Only with one class of labels, the structure of generative adversarial networks has an ability to solve two-class problem. By using the filtered background data and their labels, generative adversarial networks are trained to improve discriminator's discriminative capability for background data in a competing style. Finally, the model discriminator can finally output big probabilities for background samples and small probabilities for anomalous samples. Experiments on two real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art competitors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and

Multiple-image SR benefits from data fusion which allows for more accurate reconstruction of the underlying high-resolution information. Deep learning is extensively used for single-image SR, but its application to multiple-image SR is much less explored. Recently, several deep networks were proposed to enhance Proba-V images, and in this paper, we focus on employing them to super-resolve the Sentinel-2 images. In particular, we investigate the influence of the training data, including real and simulated low-resolution images, on the final SR outcome.

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently been shown to perform well for classification of IR images, we consider the common scenario in which the target object is partially occluded. Recent work demonstrates that deep CNNs struggle to generalize under occlusion, and Compositional CNNs (CompNets) have been proposed as deep models to mitigate this shortcoming. In this work, we apply CompNets to IR imagery, discuss the considerations in moving from natural images to IR, and analyze performance on a dataset that has been artificially occluded. Our results indicate that CompNets do, indeed, bolster robustness to occlusion in the IR domain.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553370","startPage":"2799","endPage":"2802","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Compositional Neural Networks for Robust Classification of Infrared Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553370/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Compositional Neural Networks for Robust Classification of Infrared Imagery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553370/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Compositional Neural Networks for Robust Classification of Infrared Imagery","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045558S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9553374,"authors":[{"name":"Aouaidjia Kamel","affiliation":["Algerian Space Agency, Space Techniques Center, Arzew, Oran, Algeria"],"firstName":"Aouaidjia","lastName":"Kamel","id":"37086940775"},{"name":"Boukerch Issam","affiliation":["Algerian Space Agency, Space Techniques Center, Arzew, Oran, Algeria"],"firstName":"Boukerch","lastName":"Issam","id":"37088991455"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553374","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Measurement","Satellites","Image color analysis","Machine learning","Generative adversarial networks","Labeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["land cover classification","data augmentation","few shot learning","GANs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553374","abstract":"In machine learning, few shot learning techniques try to generate high prediction accuracy from few training examples.

First, we train a cGAN with a small dataset to classify images by mapping each pixel of the input image to its class. Second, we augment the images of the dataset by generating new samples using a traditional GAN model, then the labels of the new samples are generated using the previously trained cGAN model. The new augmented labeled data is associated with the original dataset to train the cGAN model again with more samples to improve the classification accuracy. Training experiments were performed on SPARCS publicly available dataset. We tested the proposed method on images of Landsat 8 and Alsat 2 satellites. The classification results show that the performance after data augmentation is better than using the original small dataset.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553374","startPage":"2309","endPage":"2312","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553374.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Augmentation for Land Cover Classification Using Generative Adversarial Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553374/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Data Augmentation for Land Cover Classification Using Generative Adversarial Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553374/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Augmentation for Land Cover Classification Using Generative Adversarial Networks","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08309S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9553386,"authors":[{"name":"Keli Cheng","affiliation":["University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Keli","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37088990999"},{"name":"Ilinca M.

This is especially true in sub-Saharan African countries that lack specific resources and technologies. Often, international non-profit groups provide targeted support for populations' health on specific matters, such as clean water initiatives and basic health clinics. This is especially critical in various ethnic populations that are not well integrated into a country's existing public health services. In countries such as Tanzania, one such ethnic population is the Maasai people. In this paper, we demonstrate how machine learning algorithms, combined with remote sensing data, can aid non-profit health delivery organizations to map Maasailand boma homesteads in northern Tanzania. Our study area encompasses over 3900 square kilometers of Massailand, where we have manually identified 635 bomas. We have evaluated four different deep neural network architectures for their ability to recognize boma, ResNet50, Xception, Inception-ResNet-V2, and ProxylessNAS, with cross-validation F1 scores of 95.32%, 95.45%, 96.78%, and 97.28%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553386","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553386.pdf","startPage":"2839","endPage":"2842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Maasailand Boma Mapping with Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9553386/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Maasailand Boma Mapping with Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054042S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9553393,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Levering","affiliation":["Wageningen University, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Levering","id":"37088758556"},{"name":"Diego Marcos","affiliation":["Wageningen University, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Marcos","id":"37085905897"},{"name":"Devis Tuia","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Devis","lastName":"Tuia","id":"37395181300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553393","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Visualization","Urban areas","Buildings","Predictive models","Convolutional neural networks","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Remote Sensing","Interpretability","Deep Learning","Liveability","Explainable AI"]}],"abstract":"Urban planners are increasingly interested in understanding what makes a neighbourhood pleasant and liveable.

We predict building quality scores from aerial images using deep neural networks and demonstrate that liveability can be predicted from overhead aerial images of a neighbourhood. We make our model interpretable by adding the intermediate task of predicting a list of housing factors, but found this to substantially degrade the results. This suggests that the unconstrained model used visual cues that are unrelated to the housing variables, and shows the difficulty of housing variable prediction from above due to the absence of visual cues such as facades.","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553393.pdf","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Liveability from Above: Understanding Quality of Life with Overhead Imagery and Deep Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Liveability from Above: Understanding Quality of Life with Overhead Imagery and Deep Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9553393/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Liveability from Above: Understanding Quality of Life with Overhead Imagery and Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039393S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9553396,"authors":[{"name":"Hamsalekha A Kumaresan","affiliation":["Lee Kong Chian Faculty Engineering and Science, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hamsalekha A","lastName":"Kumaresan","id":"37088991650"},{"name":"H.T Ewe","affiliation":["Lee Kong Chian Faculty Engineering and Science, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia"],"firstName":"H.T","lastName":"Ewe","id":"37370518800"},{"name":"Gobi Vetharatnam","affiliation":["Lee Kong Chian Faculty Engineering and Science, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Gobi","lastName":"Vetharatnam","id":"37088230805"},{"name":"Li-Jun Jiang","affiliation":["The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Li-Jun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272130700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553396","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave integrated circuits","Shape","Snow","Computational modeling","Microwave theory and techniques","Mathematical models","Finite element analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active microwave remote sensing","Computational Electromagnetics (CEM)","Coupled FEM with MoM","Relaxed Hierarchical Equivalent Source Algorithm (RHESA)","Snow medium"]}],"abstract":"Active microwave remote sensing is essential to monitor the conditions of the environment by analyzing the microwave returns from the earth terrain.

These theoretical models consider three shapes of scatterers which can be used to represent the ice particles of snow medium. These mentioned shapes are sphere, droxtal and hexagonal column.

distinct substances. The parameters of the estimated models are difficult to set. In this paper, we first propose a spatial-spectral conditional generative adversarial networks (scGANs) method to solve this problem, based on the following assumptions: the unmixing process from pixels to abundance can be viewed as a transformation of two modalities with an intrinsic specific relationship. The method learns the manifold structure of the hyperspectral data using an adversarial strategy, inputting pixels blocks with spatial information to generate the abundance of the central pixels. Then, we proposed superpixel segmentation and random splitting method to synthesize data with spatial structure. Finally, the proposed scGANs method is evaluated using synthetic data and real hyperspectral data, and compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method outperforms all the comparison methods in the experiments.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553398","startPage":"3329","endPage":"3332","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553398.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pixels-to-Abundances Translation with Spatial-Spectral Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Hyperspectral Unmixing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553398/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pixels-to-Abundances Translation with Spatial-Spectral Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Hyperspectral Unmixing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553398/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61877066"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pixels-to-Abundances Translation with Spatial-Spectral Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Hyperspectral Unmixing","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0003329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057332S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9553449,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Xiao","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37088991400"},{"name":"Siying Chen","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088758818"},{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088750296"},{"name":"Zhengang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37087093368"},{"name":"Tao Huang","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37087090713"},{"name":"Yuchen Liang","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuchen","lastName":"Liang","id":"37088751171"},{"name":"Jin Qin","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Qin","id":"37086503336"},{"name":"Rong Ma","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37088811672"},{"name":"Zongyao Yin","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zongyao","lastName":"Yin","id":"37088993771"},{"name":"Ruiqing Yan","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruiqing","lastName":"Yan","id":"37088992242"},{"name":"Xianchuan Yu","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xianchuan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37280837000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553449","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553449","abstract":"Convolutional neural network has been widely used in hyperspectral image classification. Compared with the early machine learning method, it has made great progress. However, the convolution kernel used in hyperspectral image classification ignores the intrinsic relationship among spatial pixels when extracting spectral features, which will lead to poor contour and very small false prediction in the classification results. Besides, The hyperspectral data can only be labeled by experts, which requires a lot of labor and material resources. In order to improve the classification accuracy of hyperspectral images and reduce the dependence on labeled samples, this paper proposed a hyperspectral image classification algorithm based on graph neural network. Through the characteristics of inherent points and edges in the graph, the spatial information and spectral information of hyperspectral images are fused. The features of unlabeled samples are used to participate in the training to improve the effect of classification model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Machine learning","Prediction algorithms","Feature extraction","Graph neural networks","Classification algorithms","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","graph theory","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["early machine learning method","convolution kernel","hyperspectral data","classification accuracy","hyperspectral images","hyperspectral image classification algorithm","graph neural network","classification model","graph convolutional network","convolutional neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral image","graph convolutional network","graph attention network"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553449","startPage":"3677","endPage":"3680","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553449.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HSGACN: Hyperspectral Image Classification Algorithm Based on Graph Convolutional Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"HSGACN: Hyperspectral Image Classification Algorithm Based on Graph Convolutional Network","accessionNumber":"21228240","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9553449/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41672323"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HSGACN: Hyperspectral Image Classification Algorithm Based on Graph Convolutional Network","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0003677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100382S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":9553515,"authors":[{"name":"Haifa Tamiminia","affiliation":["State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF), NY, USA"],"firstName":"Haifa","lastName":"Tamiminia","id":"37088992570"},{"name":"Bahram Salehi","affiliation":["State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF), NY, USA"],"firstName":"Bahram","lastName":"Salehi","id":"38236017500"},{"name":"Masoud Mahdianpari","affiliation":["C-CORE, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Mahdianpari","id":"38569552000"},{"name":"Colin M.

This paper aimed to estimate shrub willow AGB using multi-spectral unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery and machine learning techniques. To accomplish this goal, a machine learning model (i.e., random forest (RF)) and a deep learning method (i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN)) were applied to the spectral bands and some vegetation indices over a site in Camillus, NY, US in July 2019. The results demonstrated the superiority of the RF model (RMSE of 1.73 Mg/ha and R2 of 0.95) compared to the CNN (RMSE of 2.69 Mg/ha and R2 of 0.89) technique. Adding vegetation indices to spectral bands and using a convolutional approach for training purposes could significantly improve the modeling efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553515","startPage":"8269","endPage":"8272","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553515.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Forest Outperformed Convolutional Neural Networks for Shrub Willow Above Ground Biomass Estimation Using Multi-Spectral UAS Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553515/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Random Forest Outperformed Convolutional Neural Networks for Shrub Willow Above Ground Biomass Estimation Using Multi-Spectral UAS Imagery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553515/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000199","fundingName":"USDA NIFA","grantNumber":"2018-68005-27925"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004765","fundingName":"Honeywell International"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Forest Outperformed Convolutional Neural Networks for Shrub Willow Above Ground Biomass Estimation Using Multi-Spectral UAS Imagery","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0008269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070209S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9553597,"authors":[{"name":"Ferdaous Chaabane","affiliation":["COSIM laboratory, SUP'COM, Carthage University, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ferdaous","lastName":"Chaabane","id":"37265698900"},{"name":"Safa R\u00e9jichi","affiliation":["COSIM laboratory, SUP'COM, Carthage University, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Safa","lastName":"R\u00e9jichi","id":"37601264200"},{"name":"Florence Tupin","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Florence","lastName":"Tupin","id":"37267795900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553597","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Image synthesis","Time series analysis","Generative adversarial networks","Feature extraction","Spatial resolution","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks","Multispectral VHR time series","deep learning techniques","etc."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553597","abstract":"Recently classical deep learning approaches are commonly used to perform spatial and temporal classification especially for Very High Resolution (VHR) images. They learn from existing low resolution or undersized datasets because of the availability and prices of VHR remote sensing images. Thus, they have witnessed a conspicuous success because it is quite challenging to classify high-dimensional multispectral time series data with few labeled samples. It is also difficult to simulate high quality samples having the same features as the real ones. It goes without saying that the introduction of GANs (Generative Adversarial Network) models as an unsupervised learning method, has allowed the extraction of accurate representations of the data via latent codes and backpropagation techniques. However, it is difficult to acquire high-quality samples with unwanted noises and uncontrolled divergences. To generate high-quality multispectral time series samples, a Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) is proposed in this work. SAGAN allows attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for VHR Multispectral time series image generation tasks. Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations which improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN performs better than traditional GANs, boosting the best inception score. The main contribution of this work is the use of one of the new generation of learning techniques, SAGAN, for Times Series VHR Multispectral Image Generation. SAGAN has been recently used only for single image generation.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553597","startPage":"4644","endPage":"4647","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553597.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks for Times Series VHR Multispectral Image Generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553597/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks for Times Series VHR Multispectral Image Generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553597/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks for Times Series VHR Multispectral Image Generation","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050583S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9553599,"authors":[{"name":"Manilo Monaco","affiliation":["University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Manilo","lastName":"Monaco","id":"37088993650"},{"name":"Giovanni Nico","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Mathematics, National Research Council, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Nico","id":"37270299200"},{"name":"Pier Francesco Biagi","affiliation":["University of Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Pier Francesco","lastName":"Biagi","id":"37945162200"},{"name":"Anita Ermini","affiliation":["University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Anita","lastName":"Ermini","id":"37088537866"},{"name":"Aleksandra Nina","affiliation":["Institute of Physics Belgrade, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Nina","id":"37088427834"},{"name":"Mario G.C.A.

However, only spatial relationship of pixels being considered by GCN-based models, the relationship between spectral bands are underutilized. To solve above issue, benefit from introducing tensor theory to GCN, a novel spatial-spectral tensor graph convolutional network (SSTGCN) is proposed to learn tensor representation of spatial-spectral feature. Firstly, from the perspective of the spatial-spectral characteristic in HSI, spatial graph tensor and spectral graph tensor are constructed to model the spatial and spectral relationships, respectively. Then, two types of modules, i.e., the spatial tensor graph convolution (SATGC) module and spectral tensor graph convolution (SETGC) module, are designed to extract discriminative features. Experimental results on the Indian Pines data set demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other HSI classification methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553641/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553641/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spatial-Spectral Tensor Graph Convolutional Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871335"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-Spectral Tensor Graph Convolutional Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050089S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9553657,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Cao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, P.

While the unsupervised learning unmixing methods are easily misled by the traditional way of initialization.

Although the micro-Doppler signatures play a critical role in target classification, the signature is a function of a radar aspect angle. Obtaining diverse signatures of a target from different aspect angles requires labor as well as monetary costs. To circumvent this issue, we synthesis the micro-Doppler signatures of diverse aspect angles from a given micro-Doppler signature of a single aspect angle. We trained separate GANs through simulated micro-Doppler signatures for each angle. The trained GANs produce artificial micro-Doppler signatures of the desired angle when micro-Doppler signatures from a certain angle are inputted. The synthesized micro-Doppler signatures from GANs and the true ones obtained by simulations are compared.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553743","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553743.pdf","startPage":"5056","endPage":"5058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Generation of Micro-Doppler Signatures of Different Aspect Angles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553743/","displayDocTitle":"Application of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Generation of Micro-Doppler Signatures of Different Aspect Angles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9553743/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"EIA-0196217"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Generation of Micro-Doppler Signatures of Different Aspect Angles","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0005056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041838S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9553765,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Motto Ros","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo Motto","lastName":"Ros","id":"37948441900"},{"name":"Michele Caon","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Caon","id":"37088993433"},{"name":"Tiziano Bianchi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Tiziano","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37269910100"},{"name":"Maurizio Martina","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Martina","id":"37296189500"},{"name":"Enrico Magli","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Magli","id":"37267305900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553765","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical losses","Image coding","Throughput","Optical imaging","Loss measurement","Radar polarimetry","Software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-level synthesis","Hardware accelerator","FPGA","Optical and SAR imaging","lossy compression","CCSDS-123","Earth observation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553765","abstract":"Transmitting images from earth observation satellites to ground is a major challenge, and a compression/encryption stage is actually mandatory. Development of hardware accelerators is highly recommended, both to relieve the software from such demanding task, and to improve performance, aiming at quasi-real-time data processing. To this end, we discuss the design, development, deployment and test of a FPGA-based accelerator, featuring a lossless and lossy (near-lossless) compression, including the data encryption too. Its architecture is well suited for different image types, including single- and multi-band optical and SAR images and can be fully run-time configurable. Measured performance showed a throughput of 10 Msamples/s, in agreement with related state-of-the-art works, focused on lossless compression only.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553765","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09553765.pdf","startPage":"7835","endPage":"7838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Level Synthesis of a Single/Multi-Band Optical and SAR Image Compression and Encryption Hardware Accelerator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9553765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"High-Level Synthesis of a Single/Multi-Band Optical and SAR Image Compression and Encryption Hardware Accelerator","htmlLink":"/document/9553765/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Level Synthesis of a Single/Multi-Band Optical and SAR Image Compression and Encryption Hardware Accelerator","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0007835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052157S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9553765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9553776,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Ding","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Ding","id":"37088990942"},{"name":"Zhulin Zong","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Zhulin","lastName":"Zong","id":"37872087000"},{"name":"Bolun Liu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Bolun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088989937"},{"name":"Shiwei Yuan","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Shiwei","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37088868372"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9553776","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Radar remote sensing","Pipelines","Imaging","Radar imaging","Hardware","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Omega-K","pipeline structure","soft IP multiplexed","real-time imaging"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces the hardware design and implementation of Omega-K imaging algorithm.

However, most of methods based on CNN fail to distinguish the difference of multispectral bands, and only use a uniform set of convolutional kernels to extract features. In this paper, we design a progressive, band-separated convolutional network architecture for discriminatively learning the features and relation among spectral bands, aiming to address the problem mentioned before. More specifically, the proposed architecture mainly consists of three aspects. First, to accurately preserve the spectral peculiarities, we divide the multispectral input image in terms of its bands into several groups. Second, our original panchromatic and multispectral inputs are filtered by a high-pass operation to further yield more spatial details. Third, we use a spectral fusion module (SFM) for each group and associate them to progressively assemble the whole architecture. It is worth mentioning that the architecture could be integrated into any other competitive CNNs to improve the performance. Both visual and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554024","startPage":"4464","endPage":"4467","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554024.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive Band-Separated Convolutional Neural Network for Multispectral Pansharpening","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554024/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Progressive Band-Separated Convolutional Neural Network for Multispectral Pansharpening","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554024/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive Band-Separated Convolutional Neural Network for Multispectral Pansharpening","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060218S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9554035,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37655013500"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088993339"},{"name":"Haonan Chen","affiliation":["Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Haonan","lastName":"Chen","id":"38507100200"},{"name":"Guangxin He","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education (KLME)","International Joint Research Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC)","Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing, University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guangxin","lastName":"He","id":"37088992799"},{"name":"Yurong Ge","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, China"],"firstName":"Yurong","lastName":"Ge","id":"37088990572"},{"name":"Lei Han","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Han","id":"37085873442"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554035","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554035","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Recurrent neural networks","Storms","Radar","Radar imaging","Predictive models","Spatiotemporal phenomena"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554035","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554035.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","startPage":"363","endPage":"366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Channel 3D Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network for Convective Storm Nowcasting","abstract":"Convective storm nowcasting has long been an important issue and has attracted substantial interest. 3D radar images and 3D re-analysis data contain spatiotemporal information of the convective processes. This paper proposes a multi-channel 3D convolutional recurrent neural network (3D-CRN) for convective storm nowcasting, which aims to learn spatiotemporal information directly from these 3D radar and reanalysis data. 3D-CRN is composed of two sub-networks: three multi-channel 3D convolutional networks are used as the front-end spatial sub-networks, and the convLSTM encoder-decoder is constructed as a back-end temporal sub-network. By combing two subnets into one unified network, 3D-CRN can be jointly trained effectively. In order to give forecasts at different lead time simultaneously, we construct a many-to-many encoder-decoder structure to avoid tedious need to train several models respectively.

However, finding the best shape and size of the SE for classification of urban remote sensing imagery is a challenging research topic, because the formats of the features may become more and more complex. For this purpose, this paper proposes a new adaptive algorithm based on the combination of parallel PSO with MM for the construction of adaptive SEs. Such that the shapes and sizes of the constructed SEs change adaptively according to the spatial features of the image and the considered classification task. As a result, the application of parallel PSO reduces the execution time compared to serial PSO, and makes the proposed algorithm can adopt several SEs simultaneously for image classification without complicating the main PSO algorithm.

Fast-spreading nature of the wildfires determine quick uncontrollable situations' causing significant effects in short periods. Despite increased difficulty in image processing approaches due to temporal resolution, complexity of spectral bands and illumination conditions, imagery data streams available from sun-synchronous satellites provide geospatial intelligence in monitoring and preventing fire threats. In this paper, we proposed a local scale burned area estimation framework that employs multispectral images in a deep learning architecture for detecting burned surfaces at patch level. This goal is accomplished by using an autoencoder (AE) network in which the latent feature layer learns normal background distribution, beneficial to background reconstruction. Furthermore, an outlier detection method (OCSVM) is used with aggregated features, latent and covariance components, in order to estimate burned coverage. Our method operates on data retrieved from Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation streaming source, which mainly contain normal scenes and limited fire affected spots.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554169","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554169.pdf","startPage":"8620","endPage":"8623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Post Fire Assessment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554169/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Post Fire Assessment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9554169/","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Post Fire Assessment","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0008620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058124S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9554234,"authors":[{"name":"Xindi Liu","affiliation":["Chang'an University"],"firstName":"Xindi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088990586"},{"name":"Gucheng Tang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Academy of Surveying and Mapping"],"firstName":"Gucheng","lastName":"Tang","id":"37088992277"},{"name":"Weibao Zou","affiliation":["Chang'an University"],"firstName":"Weibao","lastName":"Zou","id":"37411483200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554234","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554234","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Atmospheric modeling","Object detection","Real-time systems","Complexity theory","Reliability","Aircraft"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Remote Sensing","Deep Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Real-time Object Detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554234","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554234.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","startPage":"4775","endPage":"4778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of Detection Accuracy of Aircraft in Remote Sensing Images Based on YOLOV5 Model","abstract":"Recently, object detection has experienced great progress.

Meanwhile, the speed of detection is another factor to be considered. At present, the model of You Only Look Once v5s (YOLOv5s) for object detection can achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. So, YOLOv5s is adopted in the study.

Aiming at these issues, this paper proposes a novel detection framework, which consists of two important parts, i.e., a Positive Sample Reweighting (PSR) module and a Feature Decoupling (FD) module. Specifically, PSR re-weights each positive proposal according to the positional relationship between each positive proposal and its ground truth. FD employs two parallel branches to extract the weights to decouple features for classification and localization tasks.

As we know there exist different types of soil around the land regions of the earth. But the physical and chemical properties of soil varies not only with change in regions, but also with time due to the factors like, deforestation, addition chemical waste etc. Here in this work we aim to develop a method to classify different types of soil based on their physical and chemical properties by analysing satellite images. Here four primary soil types, namely, alluvial, black, desert and red, available in India has been considered for our experimentation. An image repository, with around 1000 images, labelled with their soil-types, is also created for this work. The images, used here are of high resolution, acquired with LANDSAT-8 satellite. We have performed our study with these large number of labelled images from each soil type, captured in different time. We developed a method of soil classification with deep convolutional neural network. The merits of this method is experimentally validated with suitable comparison and proved to be effective in identifying proper soil class accurately.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554290","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554290.pdf","startPage":"4087","endPage":"4090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soil Type Classification from High Resolution Satellite Images with Deep CNN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Soil Type Classification from High Resolution Satellite Images with Deep CNN","htmlLink":"/document/9554290/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soil Type Classification from High Resolution Satellite Images with Deep CNN","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085055S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9554304,"authors":[{"name":"Junrong Qu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-spatial Information Processing and Application System, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junrong","lastName":"Qu","id":"37088993091"},{"name":"Xiaolan Qiu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-spatial Information Processing and Application System, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolan","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37289437100"},{"name":"Chibiao Ding","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-spatial Information Processing and Application System, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chibiao","lastName":"Ding","id":"37302077800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554304","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface reconstruction","Geoscience and remote sensing","Big Data applications","Radar polarimetry","Spatial resolution","Synthetic aperture radar","L-band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single-polarized data","full-polarized data","image resolution","polarization channels","DNN"]}],"abstract":"High-resolution (HR) SAR images contain rich details thus offer better capabilities on describing the target spatial properties. Besides, Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data can convey physical characteristics embedded in the polarimetric information. However, HR and polarimetric are two conflicting properties since acquiring PolSAR data will limit the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) for each polarization hence limit the resolution. Tackling this issue, recovering HR full-polarized (FP) data from HR single-polarized (SP) data using DNN is a meaningful approach. This paper studies the ability of DNN to recover FP information from SP data of different resolutions and different polarization channels in various areas. We use UAVSAR L-band data for experiments. Results demonstrate the feasibility of using DNN trained by lower-resolution FP data to recover HR FP data from HR SP data. It is showed that the performance is more notable over natural surfaces than in built-up areas, and HH polarization has a better reconstruction result compared with other channels. Besides, the recovery capability in different regions is also compared, which provides some inspirations for FP and HR SAR data applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Recovering Polsar Information from Single-Polarized Data Using DNN","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554304","startPage":"812","endPage":"815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554304.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Recovering Polsar Information from Single-Polarized Data Using DNN","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554304/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Recovering Polsar Information from Single-Polarized Data Using DNN","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0000812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065268S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9554345,"authors":[{"name":"Takato Yamada","affiliation":["the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takato","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37088756771"},{"name":"Akira Iwasaki","affiliation":["the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Iwasaki","id":"37567246200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554345","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554345","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Training","Time series analysis","Geoscience and remote sensing","Computational efficiency","Convolutional neural networks","Multiresolution analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet transform","convolutional neural network","hyperspectral data","classification","multi-resolution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554345","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554345.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","startPage":"3685","endPage":"3688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Multi-Resolution Hyperspectral Data by Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"To realize the pixel-based classification of hyperspectral data, wavelet transform is applied to produce two-dimensional data, which makes it possible to combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Such applications aim to detect potential suspicious events, violent human actions from an untrimmed and lengthy UAV video. Anomaly detection methods are highly in demand because it is unrealistic for human experts to manually detect all abnormal events in image scene. However, anomaly detection methods in aerial videos are rarely studied in the remote sensing community. In this paper, We propose a future frame prediction network based on convolutional variational autoencoder networks to detect anomalous events. Compared to several models, our network has a superior performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554396.pdf","startPage":"8237","endPage":"8240","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Aerial Videos Via Future Frame Prediction Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surveillance","Data acquisition","Streaming media","Inspection","Feature extraction","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial videos","anomaly detection","convolutional variational autoencoder networks","future frame prediction","unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Aerial Videos Via Future Frame Prediction Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554396/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Aerial Videos Via Future Frame Prediction Networks","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0008237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080867S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9554401,"authors":[{"name":"Jianing Wang","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088993046"},{"name":"Hanjiang Xiong","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hanjiang","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37086323455"},{"name":"Jianya Gong","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianya","lastName":"Gong","id":"37290570100"},{"name":"Xianwei Zheng","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xianwei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086325220"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554401","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554401","abstract":"Detecting buildings with structure information (e.g., rooflines) from satellite images is a significant yet challenging task. Existing methods usually suffer from the spatial and spectral diversity and complexity of the architectures. In this paper, a deep learning-based approach is proposed to extract structured building rooflines. We use convolutional neural networks to detect corner and line segment primitives. Meanwhile, a collaborative branch of semantic annotation information is combined to obtain the building segmentation map, which ensures the spatial and topological relations of the extracted primitives. Experiments on the SpaceNet dataset show that our proposed approach improves the accuracy of building extraction. Furthermore, the planar graph representation promotes three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and other subsequent applications.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554401","startPage":"2417","endPage":"2420","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554401.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured Building Extraction from High-Resolution Satellite Images with a Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Satellites","Buildings","Semantics","Robustness","Data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Building extraction","planar graph","convolutional neural network","segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Structured Building Extraction from High-Resolution Satellite Images with a Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554401/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured Building Extraction from High-Resolution Satellite Images with a Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9554418,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Sharma","affiliation":["Chester F.

While TT has been successfully used before for compressing classification CNNs, this work is the first one that uses it to compress a detection CNN. We refer to the resulting network as YOLOrs-lite and compare its performance against standard YOLOrs as well as other state-of-the-art detection networks.

However, at faster track deviations, the algorithm has to make a trade-off between handling higher motion error frequency and finer instantaneous squint angles. Subaperture selection plays a crucial role in the overall performance of SATA. This paper proposes two techniques based on adaptive blocking and complex dual apodization (CDA) to improve the performance of SATA in the presence of high frequency motion error. The techniques are verified both using simulated and real L-band datasets. A significant improvement in the overall focusing quality of far range targets is achieved using the adaptive technique. The apodization based scheme can improve both the resolution and sidelobe levels that are otherwise traded-off in a fixed block length SATA.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554447","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554447.pdf","startPage":"3161","endPage":"3164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Subaperture Based Aperture-Dependent Motion Compensation Based on Adaptive Blocking and Apodization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554447/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Subaperture Based Aperture-Dependent Motion Compensation Based on Adaptive Blocking and Apodization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9554447/","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Subaperture Based Aperture-Dependent Motion Compensation Based on Adaptive Blocking and Apodization","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0003161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044837S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9554448,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086048271"},{"name":"Yujing Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yujing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088993094"},{"name":"Minghua Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Minghua","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37087088397"},{"name":"Jiawei Ning","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Ning","id":"37087318942"},{"name":"Min Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088989698"},{"name":"Yunsong Li","affiliation":["Joint Laboratory of High Speed Multi-source Image Coding and Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yunsong","lastName":"Li","id":"37292407800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554448","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel hyperspectral image (HSI) anomaly detection method is proposed. This method is inspired by three ideas. First, the spatial resolution of the HSIs is sacrificed for their spectral information. Structural information of the HSIs tends to be smooth and distorts from that of the real scene. Second, with a loose false alarm rate, it is not difficult to pick out all the anomalies. Third, gradients of these probable anomalies can be transformed to enhance the spatial information of the HSI. Meanwhile, it is desirable that the enhanced HSI could be detected more precisely. Three modules are designed with respect to these three ideas, which are locating the probable pixels, local gradient guidance, and the anomaly detection for the enhanced HSI. Specifically, some probable anomalies are firstly selected. Secondly, the gradients of these selected pixels are transformed and utilized to guide the spatial enhancement for the HSI locally. Finally, the final detection is implemented on the enhanced HSI. Experimental results obtained on four real HSIs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554448.pdf","startPage":"4432","endPage":"4435","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Local Gradient Guidance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data analysis","Geoscience and remote sensing","Detectors","Spatial resolution","Anomaly detection","Hyperspectral imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","hyperspectral image","local gradient guidance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Local Gradient Guidance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554448/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61901362"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002338","fundingName":"Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"112-425920021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Local Gradient Guidance","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053434S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9554470,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Obviously, information about the palm trees number and health conditions is very fundamental for assessing stress and disease, monitoring stage of growth and development, as well as predicting yield. Deep learning is an innovative method, recently adapted and applied in forest environment to detect and delineate individual tree crowns from remote sensing imagery. This paper aims the experimentation of U-N et deep neural network model to detect individual date palm tree crowns from very high spatial resolution images acquired above \u201cTarga N'Touchka\u201d Oasis plantations in south-west of Morocco. To achieve this goal, a scene of Bing-images has been used. It was sampled in 420 of 128x128 pixels and divided into 70% sub-images to train the data and 30% were used to test and validate the output results. The U-Net model was implemented using Tensor-Flow and Keras. The accuracy of results obtained indicates better classification efficiency (96.94%). Overall, individual crowns of date palms are satisfactory delimited and mapped. However, despite its sophistication and performance, the model requires extensive training information and high investment in calibration mode. As well as, the trees with overlapping crowns are not properly recognized as separate entities.

However, attitude jitter of observation satellites is a problem that degenerates the development of imaging quality and resolution. In order to reduce the geo-positioning errors and improve the geometric accuracy of remote sensing images, satellite jitter have been studied in recent years. In this work, a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture is proposed to automatically learn and correct the deformed scene features from a single remote sensing image. In the proposed GAN, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to discriminate the inputs and another CNN is used to generate so-called fake inputs. In order to explore the usefulness and effectiveness of GAN for jitter detection, the proposed GAN are trained on part of PatternNet dataset and tested on three popular remote sensing datasets. Several experiments show that the proposed models provide competitive results compared to other methods. the proposed GAN reveals the huge potential of GAN-based methods for the analysis of attitude jitter from remote sensing images.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554491","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554491.pdf","startPage":"2683","endPage":"2686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Remote Sensing Image Jitter Restoration Based on Deep Generative Adversarial Network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9554491/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote Sensing Image Jitter Restoration Based on Deep Generative Adversarial Network","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044828S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9554522,"authors":[{"name":"Shujun Li","affiliation":["Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shujun","lastName":"Li","id":"37088993266"},{"name":"Lianzhi Huo","affiliation":["Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lianzhi","lastName":"Huo","id":"37902022000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554522","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Change detection algorithms","Biological system modeling","Feature extraction","Information retrieval","Explosives","Data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fully Convolutional Network","Pyramid Attention","Change Detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554522","abstract":"Change detection technology based on remote sensing image can monitor the changes of ecological environment, which is of great significance for the study of the interaction between human and natural environment. However, it's difficult to automatically mine useful change information in traditional methods with the explosive growth of remote sensing data. With the development of deep learning methods, change detection of remote sensing images based on fully convolutional neural network has become one of the research hotspots to extract change information automatically. Recently, two advanced deep learning models, FC-EF and FC-Siam-diff, have been proposed for change detection of bi-temporal remote sensing images. To dig deeper multiscale and multilevel features thoroughly and improve detection accuracy, pyramid attention layer is added and an improved fully convolutional network FC-Siam-diff-PA is proposed in this paper. By introducing pyramid attention layer, the multiscale change information is further extracted from the difference feature map processed by the encoder structure of original network. Experiments were performed in the region of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the FC-EF network model and FC-Siam-diff model in change information extraction.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554522","startPage":"4352","endPage":"4355","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554522.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Based on Fully Convolutional Network With Pyramid Attention","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554522/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Based on Fully Convolutional Network With Pyramid Attention","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554522/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Based on Fully Convolutional Network With Pyramid Attention","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036312S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9554545,"authors":[{"name":"Yuya Matsumoto","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuya","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37088993278"},{"name":"Ryo Natsuaki","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Natsuaki","id":"37400379700"},{"name":"Akira Hirose","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37298386700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554545","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554545","abstract":"This paper proposes a quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN) for PolSAR land classification.

In addition, we propose the Intersection Over Union (IOU) loss function for increasing the overlap between the predicted classes and ground reference data. The proposed method was applied to identify soybean and corn from a study area situated in the US corn belt using multi-temporal Landsat images. The study shows that our method outperforms related methods, obtaining a Kappa coefficient of 91.8%.

Firstly, YOLO network is used to detect targets under strong clutter. That is, the trained YOLO network is used to detect and classify targets in the fore- and aft-beam SAR images, so as to effectively distinguish background clutter from targets. At the same time, the YOLO network is used to carry out the bounding box regression of the target in the fore- and aft-beam SAR image to realize the extraction of the target position in the SAR image. Furthermore, aiming at the problem that the detection results of YOLO network have both stationary targets and moving targets, we excluded stationary targets according to whether there is an azimuth location offset of the target in between the fore-and aft-beam SAR images, and finally obtained detection results of the moving target. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554604","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554604.pdf","startPage":"5315","endPage":"5318","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Moving Target Detection Method Based on Yolo for Dual-Beam Sar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Moving Target Detection Method Based on Yolo for Dual-Beam Sar","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9554604/","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2017- YFB0502700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571099,61501098,61671113"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Moving Target Detection Method Based on Yolo for Dual-Beam Sar","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0005315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046771S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9554633,"authors":[{"name":"Yuansheng Hua","affiliation":["Data Science in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany","Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Yuansheng","lastName":"Hua","id":"37086504484"},{"name":"Lichao Mou","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Lichao","lastName":"Mou","id":"37076570200"},{"name":"Pu Jin","affiliation":["Data Science in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Pu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37088581159"},{"name":"Xiao Xiang Zhu","affiliation":["Data Science in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany","Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Xiao Xiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37404573000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554633","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554633","abstract":"Aerial scene recognition is a fundamental research problem in interpreting high-resolution aerial imagery. Over the past few years, most studies focus on classifying an image into one scene category, while in real-world scenarios, it is more often that a single image contains multiple scenes. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a more practical yet underexplored task-multi-scene recognition in single images. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset, called Mul-tiScene dataset, composed of 100,000 unconstrained images each with multiple labels from 36 different scenes. Among these images, 14,000 of them are manually interpreted and assigned ground-truth labels, while the remaining images are provided with crowdsourced labels, which are generated from low-cost but noisy OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. By doing so, our dataset allows two branches of studies: 1) developing novel CNNs for multi-scene recognition and 2) learning with noisy labels. We experiment with extensive baseline models on our dataset to offer a benchmark for multi-scene recognition in single images. Aiming to expedite further researches, we will make our dataset and pre-trained models available\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\nhttps://github.com/Hua-YS/Multi-Scene-Recognition.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554633","startPage":"4948","endPage":"4951","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554633.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconstrained Aerial Scene Recognition with Deep Neural Networks and a New Dataset","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Image recognition","Geoscience and remote sensing","Benchmark testing","Noise measurement","Convolutional neural networks","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network (CNN)","multi-scene recognition in single images","crowdsourced annotations","large-scale aerial image dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Unconstrained Aerial Scene Recognition with Deep Neural Networks and a New Dataset","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554633/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC)","grantNumber":"ERC-2016-StG-714087"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconstrained Aerial Scene Recognition with Deep Neural Networks and a New Dataset","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063074S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9554662,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Meng","affiliation":["School of Geosciences, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Meng","id":"37087101474"},{"name":"Qingyu Tian","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Qingyu","lastName":"Tian","id":"37088643155"},{"name":"Handan Sun","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Handan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37088992082"},{"name":"Danya Xu","affiliation":["Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory(Zhuhai), Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Danya","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088993761"},{"name":"Tao Song","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China","Polytechnical University of Madrid, Boadilla del Monte, Spain"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Song","id":"37391686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554662","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554662","abstract":"Cyclone, especially tropical cyclones, are one of the most significant meteorological disasters in the world, which seriously threaten the safety of life and property.

Traditional deforestation monitoring requires a lot of manpower and material resources through manual visual interpretation and manual change patterns labelling, which has problems of low efficiency and high missed alarm rate. Therefore, this paper explores the detection for deforestation changes from remote sensing images based on deep learning framework, and aims to help forestry department manage and monitor forest resources. In this paper, an U-Net+LSTM framework is used to detect the changes of deforestation from remote sensing images. The evaluation data is Sentinel-2 dataset and the study area is Guangxi Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County in China. The results show that the F1 score of the framework is as high as 0.715, which proves the proposed model can effectively detect the change from forest to bare soil in remote sensing images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554689/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554689/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deforestation Detection Based on U-Net and LSTM in Optical Satellite Remote Sensing Images","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009407","fundingName":"TUOHAI special project 2020 from Bohai Rim Energy Research Institute of Northeast Petroleum University","grantNumber":"HBHZX202002,KYCXTD201903"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deforestation Detection Based on U-Net and LSTM in Optical Satellite Remote Sensing Images","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0003753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056706S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9554705,"authors":[{"name":"Rongfang Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Rongfang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086120070"},{"name":"Weidong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086943701"},{"name":"Pinghai Dong","affiliation":["Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Pinghai","lastName":"Dong","id":"37088993102"},{"name":"Wei Haojiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Haojiang","id":"37088992914"},{"name":"Licheng Jiao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Licheng","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37276095000"},{"name":"Jia- Wei Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jia- Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600062700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554705","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Visualization","Neural networks","Speckle","Radar polarimetry","Noise measurement","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Change Detection","SAR Image","Convolutional Neural Network","Few-Shot Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554705","abstract":"In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection, it is quite challenging to exploit the changing information from the noisy difference image subject to the speckle.

This paper is the first step towards a unique deep learning solution for jointly unwrapping and restoring the absolute phase.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554726","startPage":"3376","endPage":"3379","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554726.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Phase Unwrapping and Speckle Filtering by Using Convolutional Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Phase noise","Filtering","Neural networks","Geoscience and remote sensing","Coherence","Speckle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase Unwrapping","Artificial Intelligence","Speckle Filtering","Convolutional Neural Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Phase Unwrapping and Speckle Filtering by Using Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9554726/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Phase Unwrapping and Speckle Filtering by Using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0003376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076102S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9554759,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Meng","affiliation":["School of Geosciences, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Meng","id":"37087101474"},{"name":"Pengfei Xie","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37088992754"},{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37088993822"},{"name":"Handan Sun","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Handan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37088992082"},{"name":"Danya Xu","affiliation":["Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory(Zhuhai), Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Danya","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088993761"},{"name":"Tao Song","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Song","id":"37391686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554759","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Sea surface","Image resolution","Tropical cyclones","Atmospheric modeling","Neural networks","Estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tropical cyclone size","Deep learning","Deep convolutional neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554759","abstract":"The accurate estimation of tropical cyclone (TC) size is one of the key steps in TC forecasting and disaster warninglmanagement.

found very useful in ground moving target indication (GMTI) for they can indicate the real positions of moving targets at different times, which is significant for SAR reconnaissance and surveillance. However, nearly all the shadow-based SAR GMTI methods only focused on detecting shadows in every separate frame and failed to make full use of the continuous observation ability of video SAR. In this paper, we propose to apply a deep learning-based multi-target tracking method to solve this problem and find that the FairMOT network which jointly detects and re-identifies objects in sequential frames is suitable for this task. To verify its performance, video SAR datasets that contain shadows of ground moving targets are obtained by simulation. The experiments on the simulation datasets show that the introduced network in this work can achieve a state-of-the-art result, for instance, the multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) can reach 83.4%.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554763","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554763.pdf","startPage":"4584","endPage":"4587","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video SAR Ground Moving Target Indication Based on Multi-Target Tracking Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Video SAR Ground Moving Target Indication Based on Multi-Target Tracking Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9554763/","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video SAR Ground Moving Target Indication Based on Multi-Target Tracking Neural Network","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049584S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9554769,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Yuan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37087087863"},{"name":"Yan Jiang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37088991502"},{"name":"Yanxia Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yanxia","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085615680"},{"name":"Richard Jiang","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communication, Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086854295"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554769","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Visualization","Speckle","Feature extraction","Radar polarimetry","Sensors","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-calibrated convolution","image de-speckling","CNNs","SAR"]}],"abstract":"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are contaminated by speckle noise, which has largely limited its practical applications. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have indicated good potential for various image processing tasks.

To enlarge the receptive field of the network, downsampling and dilated convolutions are employed in each self-calibrated block. Also, the contextual information from spaces with different scales is extracted and concentrated to obtain accurate despeckled images.

The performance of such empirical relations is highly dependent on the variations of raindrop size distribution. In real applications, such empirical algorithms often need to be adjusted for different climate regimes and/or different rainfall types, and we do not have a simple parametric expression linking radar observables to rainfall intensity. Even if one can eliminate all the random errors associated with radar measurements, the parameterization uncertainty inherent in the empirical relations is hard to reduce. In addition, it is difficult to estimate surface rain rates with the radar measurements aloft, especially during the precipitation events characterized by dramatically changing vertical structures (i.e., precipitation particle sizes and distributions are changing during the falling process). In this paper, a convolutional neural network-based machine learning approach is developed to estimate surface rainfall rate from multidimensional polarimetric measurements. This deep learning algorithm can extract the complex relation from high dimensional input space (i.e., radar data) to the target space (i.e., surface rain rate). Polarimetric radar observations and rain gauge data collected near Melbourne, Florida are utilized for demonstration. The trained model is also extended to the whole radar coverage domain to provide complete rainfall mapping. Independent verification results show that this deep learning model has superior performance to conventional fixed-parameter rainfall relations based on either single- or dual-polarization radar measurements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Radar remote sensing","Rain","Uncertainty","Radar measurements","Spaceborne radar","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

Within the presented work, we exploited Sentinel-5p radiance data (Level 1 b) to detect and retrieve SO2 volcanic emissions through a neural network based algorithmthat produces rapid SO2 vertical column estimates. The dataset used for training the net was composed of 13 TROPOMI Level 2 \u201cOffline\u201d SO2 data collected during the Etna Volcano eruption that occurred in 2018 from 22 December to 1 January.

Random sampling - while being the virtual standard in the field to divide the available data into train and test set - is the worst choice in this scenario as it leads to a large degree of spatial correlation between these two sets which are assumed to be independent. Already pointed out in several earlier works, this paper reconfirms this fact and compares several alternatives. Two of the evaluated techniques allow to draw a large amount of unbiased test samples and lead to significantly less biased error estimates. The urgent recommendation is using multi-image datasets or - if only a single image is available - refraining to use random sampling and instead rely on either of these or similar methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9554961/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","accessionNumber":"21228870","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The Trap Of Random Sampling and How to Avoid It - Alternative Sampling Strategies for a Realistic Estimate of the Generalization Error in Remote Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Trap Of Random Sampling and How to Avoid It - Alternative Sampling Strategies for a Realistic Estimate of the Generalization Error in Remote Sensing","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0002020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05657S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9554977,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, P.R.

However, the complex hyperspectral image does not conform to the assumption of multivariate normal distribution in most methods. At the same time, the existence of unknown abnormal targets in the background will also affect the modeling of the background. To solve the above problems, a hyperspectral anomaly detection method based on adaptive weighted sparse dictionary learning (AWSDLD) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the dictionary learning framework based on adaptive weights is used to learn more representative background dictionaries without considering the background distribution. Secondly, due to the capped norm property, the proposed method can effectively suppress the influence of abnormal targets on background modeling. Finally, the abnormal targets are more significant and easier to be detected in the residual image between the reconstructed image and the original image. The experimental results on three real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554977","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09554977.pdf","startPage":"4176","endPage":"4179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Based on Adaptive Weighted Sparse Dictionary Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9554977/","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Based on Adaptive Weighted Sparse Dictionary Learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9554977/","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Project","grantNumber":"2020YFB2103902"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100017128","fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61825603"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61632018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Based on Adaptive Weighted Sparse Dictionary Learning","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0004176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055781S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9554977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9554982,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodi Shang","affiliation":["Center of Hyperspectral Imaging in Remote Sensing (CHIRS), Information and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodi","lastName":"Shang","id":"37086510121"},{"name":"Shihui Liu","affiliation":["Center of Hyperspectral Imaging in Remote Sensing (CHIRS), Information and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Shihui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088993204"},{"name":"Meiping Song","affiliation":["Center of Hyperspectral Imaging in Remote Sensing (CHIRS), Information and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Meiping","lastName":"Song","id":"37278155200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9554982","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Diversity reception","Geoscience and remote sensing","Object detection","Particle measurements","Minimization","Object recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral target detection","particle swarm optimization","constrained energy minimization","target-constrained band selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9554982","abstract":"A large number of spectral bands in hyperspectral data can help to identify ground objects but also bring additional computational burden.

TCPSOBS obtains the local and global optimal values of the particle swarm in the current iteration process by calculating the fitness function of each particle derived by constrained energy minimization (CEM), and iteratively updates the particle swarm to find the particle with the optimal band subset index.

Compared with traditional interpretation methods and machine learning methods, various landslide detection models based on deep learning algorithm such as convolutional neural network (CNN) perform better and more intelligent. DenseN et is an improved CNN algorithm based on image classification, which was proposed in 2017. In this paper, we transferred the DenseNet and CNN to construct landslide detection models. After accuracy comparison, it can be shown that DenseNet performs better than CNN. The Kappa coefficient and F1 score is of 0.965, 0.995 for DenseNet, and 0.908, 0.896 for CNN, respectively.

The NNs are trained using in-situ SM measurements as reference data, and SMOS Level-3 Temperature Brightness (TB) values and other auxiliary information, like MODIS NDVI, soil texture, and Skin Temperature from ECMWF as input. The retrieval is done in three steps. First multiple NN s, one per available in-situ site, are trained. Then a \u201crepresentative\u201d reference SM dataset is defined by examining the statistical relationships which link measurements from individual insitu SM sites and the input data. Finally, this representative reference SM data set is used to train an artificial NN using SMOS TBs and other inputs over the period 2011\u20132014. The resulting NN is in turn applied to 2017 SMOS TBs and others input data to retrieve SM at a global scale. The NN predicted SM is compared against SMOS Level 2 SM products as well as ECMWF forecast and is found to well capture the temporal and spatial variability of SM.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9555011","startPage":"6996","endPage":"6999","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09555011.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9555011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Estimation of Surface Soil Moisture Using Neural Networks Trained by In-Situ Measurements and Passive L-Band Telemetry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Temperature distribution","Soil measurements","Sea measurements","Moisture","Surface soil","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)","Neural Network (NN)","Soil Moisture (SM)","Temperature Brightness (TB)","ISMN","MODIS NDVI","ECMWF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Global Estimation of Surface Soil Moisture Using Neural Networks Trained by In-Situ Measurements and Passive L-Band Telemetry","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9555011/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Estimation of Surface Soil Moisture Using Neural Networks Trained by In-Situ Measurements and Passive L-Band Telemetry","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0006996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057119S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9555011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9555015,"authors":[{"name":"Anas Tukur Balarabe","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Portsmouth, UK"],"firstName":"Anas Tukur","lastName":"Balarabe","id":"37088992747"},{"name":"Ivan Jordanov","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Portsmouth, UK"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Jordanov","id":"37268087700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0368-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4762-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"9555015","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Deep learning","Image segmentation","Image color analysis","Semantics","Merging","Geoscience and remote sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks (CNN)","Deep learning","LULC","multilabel","scene classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555015","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9555015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9555015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553016","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/9553015/9553016/09555015.pdf","startPage":"5985","endPage":"5988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LULC Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Network","abstract":"The topic of land use and land cover classification (LULC) has attracted the interest of many researchers in recent times.

In this work, we investigate class heterogeneity, which so far, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored in LULC or scene classification.

However, the CNN model faces the \u201coverfitting\u201d problem when the number of training samples is small. To improve the classification accuracy of CNN under the condition of limited training set, an ensemble CNN method based on pixel-pair and random feature selection (RFS) for HSIC is proposed in this paper. With the purpose of expanding training samples, the pixel-pair feature (PPF) is used in the presented study. Besides, ensemble CNN based on RFS is applied to further improve the classification performance. Experimental results based on two standard hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better classification performance than the PPF based on CNN (PPF-CNN) and RFS based on SVM (RFS-SVM) methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Radio frequency","Support vector machines","Geoscience and remote sensing","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural

Firstly, since there is no labeled input data for training in anomaly detection, the detection model is obtained by training convolutional neural network with transferred learning. Then the model is decomposed to increase the number of convolution layers, that is, the depth of the network, so as to give more accurate results without over fitting. At the same time, the spatial information of the input data is extracted in order to make full use of the existing data for detection. Finally, combining the spectral and spatial information of the current pixel, the detection result is given.

Fusarium wilt on Phalaenopsis. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) and constrained energy minimization (CEM) were used to find abnormal areas.

The results showed that, on the fifth day of Phalaenopsis infection, the best accuracy rates for detecting Fusarium wilt using VNIR and SWIR hyperspectral imaging were 93.5% and 94.9%, respectively.

However, the generated samples by the GAN s sometimes even lead to a decrease in the performance of the ATR model. In this paper, we propose a filtering approach to address this harm of generated samples. The proposed filtering approach is based on a stable generation model. The stable generation model can continuously and stably generate different batches of target samples. Then, multiple SVMs trained by different SAR target sample sets provide pseudo-labels to the other SVMs to improve the accuracy of the filtering results. Therefore, the proposed approach improves the recognition ability of the A-TR model dynamically while continuously filtering generated target samples. Several experimental results show the superiority of the proposed filtering approach based on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data set. When the number of training samples is 14.5% of the original training set, the recognition rate of the ATR model still reaches 91.27% with the help of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-16 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555135/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Filtering Approach for Generated Samples by GANS in SAR ATR","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971101,61971104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Filtering Approach for Generated Samples by GANS in SAR ATR","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0005255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043925S","chronDate":"11-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9553015","isNumber":"9553016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9553015","xplore-issue":"9553016","articleId":"9555135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9555149,"authors":[{"name":"Surya Prakash Tiwari","affiliation":["Center for Environment & Water, Research Institute, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Surya Prakash","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37086521391"},{"name":"Sudhir Kumar Chaturvedi","affiliation":["University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Sudhir Kumar","lastName":"Chaturvedi","id":"38231099100"},{"name":"Subhrangshu Adhikary","affiliation":["Dr. B.C.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel sparse SAR automatic target recognition (ATR) framework, which is composed by the regularization sparse recovery algorithm and YOLO networks, so as to identify the SAR target quickly and accurately. In the proposed framework, we first use the complex approximate message passing (CAMP) based sparse image recovery algorithm to construct the sparse SAR image dataset, then identify the SAR targets by YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 networks.

To tackle this challenging issue, we propose a novel end-to-end learning-based framework. Specifically, by taking advantage of the linear approximation theorem, we first formulate the problem explicitly, which boils down to determining the interpolation weights and high-order approximation errors. Then, we design a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">lightweight</i>\n neural network to adaptively learn unified and sorted interpolation weights as well as the high-order refinements, by analyzing the local geometry of the input point cloud. The proposed method can be interpreted by the explicit formulation, and thus is more memory-efficient than existing ones. In sharp contrast to the existing methods that work only for a pre-defined and fixed upsampling factor, the proposed framework only requires a single neural network with one-time training to handle various upsampling factors within a typical range, which is highly desired in real-world applications. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy to drive such a flexible ability. In addition, our method can handle non-uniformly distributed and noisy data well. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Existing QoS prediction methods have made great progress in modeling users and services as well as exploiting contexts of service invocations. However, they ignore the completion of service requests/responses relies on the underlying network topology and the complex interactions between Autonomous Systems. To tackle this challenge, we propose a topology-aware neural (TAN) model for collaborative QoS prediction. In the TAN model, the features of users, services, and intermediate nodes on the communication path are projected to a shared latent space as input features. To jointly characterize the invocation process, the path features and end-cross features are captured respectively through an explicit path modeling layer and an implicit cross-modeling layer. After that, a gating layer fuses and transmits these features to the prediction layer for estimating unknown QoS values. In this way, TAN provides a flexible framework that can comprehensively capture the invocation context for making accurate QoS prediction. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that TAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the tasks of response time, throughput, and reliability prediction. Also, TAN shows better extensibility of using auxiliary information.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3116865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9603995/09555220.pdf","startPage":"1538","endPage":"1552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3116865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology-Aware Neural Model for Highly Accurate QoS Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555220/","displayDocTitle":"Topology-Aware Neural Model for Highly Accurate QoS Prediction","volume":"33","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 July 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9555220/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61962061, 61562090 and 61872084"},{"fundingName":"Yunnan Provincial Foundation for Leaders of Disciplines in Science and Technology","grantNumber":"202005AC160005"},{"fundingName":"Top Young Talents of \u201dTen Thousand Plan\u201d in Yunnan Province","grantNumber":"YNWR-QNBJ-2019-188"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007839","fundingName":"Yunnan University"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for Intelligent Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Technology","grantNumber":"2020B1212030010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology-Aware Neural Model for Highly Accurate QoS Prediction","sourcePdf":"tpds-wu-3116865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143551S","chronDate":"July 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9603995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9603995","articleId":"9555220","onlineDate":"30 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9555233,"authors":[{"name":"Qingzhi Liu","affiliation":["Information Technology Group, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands","Interconnected Resource-aware Intelligent Systems Group, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9591458/9555233/liu-3116863-small.gif","p":["Qingzhi Liu received the BS degree in telecommunication and the MEng degree in software engineering from Xidian University, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the MSc (with cum laude) and the PhD degrees from the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, in 2011 and 2016, respectively.

Although the relevant problems in communication and computation have been well studied in data center environments, few works have considered the issues in an Internet of Things (IoT) edge scenario. In fact, processing data in a load balancing way for the latter case is more challenging. The main reason is that, unlike a data center, both the data sources and the network infrastructure in an IoT edge system can be dynamic. Moreover, with different performance requirements from IoT networks and edge servers, it will be hard to characterize the performance model and to perform runtime optimization for the whole system. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose a load-balancing aware networking approach for efficient data processing in IoT edge systems. Specifically, we introduce an IoT network dynamic clustering solution using the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which can both fulfill the communication balancing requirements from IoT networks and the computation balancing requirements from edge servers. Moreover, we implement our system with a long short term memory (LSTM) based Dueling Double Deep Q-Learning Network (D3QN) model, and our experiments with real-world datasets collected from an autopilot vehicle demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve significant performance improvement compared to benchmark solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3116863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9591458/09555233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3116863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591458","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Load-Balancing Aware Network Control in IoT Edge Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Load-Balancing Aware Network Control in IoT Edge Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 June 2022","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555233/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2021MS017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Load-Balancing Aware Network Control in IoT Edge Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-cheng-3116863-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115782S","chronDate":"June 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9591458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9591458","articleId":"9555233","onlineDate":"30 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9555250,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-7120-1577"},{"name":"Zihan Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zihan","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Zhimin Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, Shanghai Dianji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-8477-3163"},{"name":"Ziyu Guo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ziyu","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0002-4792-1398"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9555250","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The direction of arrival (DOA) estimation problem is addressed in this letter. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided system for the DOA estimation is proposed. Unlike traditional DOA estimation systems, a low-cost system with only one complete functional receiver is given by changing the phases of the reflected signals at the RIS elements to realize the multiple measurements. Moreover, an atomic norm-based method is proposed for the DOA estimation by exploiting the target sparsity in the spatial domain and solved by a semi-definite programming (SDP) method. Furthermore, the RIS elements can be any geometry array for practical consideration, so a transformation matrix is formulated and different from the conventional SDP method. Simulation results show that the proposed method can estimate the DOA more accurately than the existing methods in the non-uniform linear RIS array.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09555250.pdf","startPage":"2023","endPage":"2027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3116789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3116789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Sparse DOA Estimation Method With Non-ULA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Atomic measurements","Simulation","Sparse matrices","Q measurement","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DOA estimation","reconfigurable intelligent surface","atomic norm","sparse reconstruction","non-uniform linear array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Sparse DOA Estimation Method With Non-ULA","volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9555250/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801112"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20180357"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFE0120700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011421","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"K202029"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Sparse DOA Estimation Method With Non-ULA","sourcePdf":"lsp-chen-3116789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048721S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9555250","onlineDate":"30 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9555258,"authors":[{"name":"Saya Mizutani","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Saya","lastName":"Mizutani","id":"37086961632"},{"name":"Masahiro Fujiwara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Fujiwara","id":"37711470200"},{"name":"Yasutoshi Makino","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasutoshi","lastName":"Makino","id":"37280554800"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Shinoda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Shinoda","id":"37280567100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-9077-6473-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-4-9077-6472-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0591-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555258","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving In-vivo Imaging Accuracy by Using Capsule Sound Source","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555258","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflectivity","Ultrasonic imaging","Transducers","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Area measurement","Imaging","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasound imaging","Wireless","Capsule sound source","Sound speed compensation"]}],"abstract":"Organs are distributed in the human abdomen complicatedly, so that it is difficult to obtain a clear abdominal image by ultrasound echo especially deep inside the body.

However, the expensive cost of a hyperspectral camera poses a problem for introducing it to other fields. Contrastingly, RGB images can be easily obtained using digital cameras, including smartphones. Hence, we have proposed an estimation method of hyperspectral images from RGB images using a neural network. In our proposed method, spectral characteristics of light sources strongly affect the estimation accuracy of hyperspectral images. In this study, we evaluate the effect of light source spectrum on the estimation accuracy in both outside and inside situations. Two models are constructed using neural networks independently by input images shot in an outside, and inside situation. Two images of a cushion taken outside and inside are respectively input into the constructed models, and the hyperspectral image is estimated for each. Comparing estimated images in outside and inside situations, estimated images in an outside situation showed high quality, accuracy, and high similarities. Considerable noise was included in images shot in an inside situation, and the estimation accuracy was found to be lower than that of the corresponding images shot in outside situations. Thus, light source spectrum has a huge effect on the estimation accuracy of hyperspectral images, and it is best for estimating hyperspectral images to input images shot under solar light using neural networks.","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1465","publicationTitle":"2021 60th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan (SICE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555180","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 60th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan (SICE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9552420/9555180/09555285.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the Effect of Light Source Spectrum on the Estimation Accuracy of High Dimensional Spectral Images Using Neural Networks Based on RGB Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555285/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the Effect of Light Source Spectrum on the Estimation Accuracy of High Dimensional Spectral Images Using Neural Networks Based on RGB Images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9555285/","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the Effect of Light Source Spectrum on the Estimation Accuracy of High Dimensional Spectral Images Using Neural Networks Based on RGB Images","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"0093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083976S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9552420","isNumber":"9555180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9552420","xplore-issue":"9555180","articleId":"9555285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9555312,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Wu","affiliation":["School of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37536741400"},{"name":"Kun Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Li","id":"37086269855"},{"name":"Yuhu Wu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yuhu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085523339"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088987877"},{"name":"Shengming Li","affiliation":["School of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Shengming","lastName":"Li","id":"37086114678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-9077-6473-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-4-9077-6472-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0591-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555312","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"abstract":"Recently, growing attention has been paid in the process of point cloud with deep learning method. It is natural to process these data hierarchical as 2D convolutional neural network(CNN) suggests, which needs to downsample the point clouds. Classic sampling approaches, such as farthest point sampling (FPS), do not consider the downstream task. Recent works showed that learning a task-specific sampling method can improve results for different tasks. We introduce a novel differentiable sampling method called IndexSample and its corresponding loss constrain. With sampled points, we add a confidence layer to further balance the sampled points' weight. During the sampling task, we have to make sure the sampling covers the most remarkable features and keep the result consistent between different point clouds, which is challenging. Experiments show that our sampling method achieves on par or better performance than classic sampling methods with much faster speed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Instruments","Sampling methods","Convolutional neural networks","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["point cloud","deep learning","sampling method"]}],"publicationTitle":"2021 60th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan (SICE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 60th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan (SICE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9552420/9555180/09555312.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IndexSample: A Learnable Sampling Network in Point Cloud Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IndexSample: A Learnable Sampling Network in Point Cloud Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555312/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555312/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IndexSample: A Learnable Sampling Network in Point Cloud Classification","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"0154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062914S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9552420","isNumber":"9555180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9552420","xplore-issue":"9555180","articleId":"9555312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9555318,"authors":[{"name":"Kota Watanabe","affiliation":["Saga University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kota","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37088988441"},{"name":"Shun Jono","affiliation":["Saga University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Jono","id":"37088988250"},{"name":"Kiyotaka Izumi","affiliation":["Saga University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyotaka","lastName":"Izumi","id":"37085379112"},{"name":"Takeshi Tsujimura","affiliation":["Saga University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Tsujimura","id":"37295265200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-9077-6473-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-4-9077-6472-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0591-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555318","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser theory","Measurement by laser beam","Aerospace electronics","Optical receivers","Adaptive optics","Laser beams","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free Space Optics","Laser Beam","Beam Profiler","Directional Control"]}],"abstract":"Free space optics needs to control the laser beam direction accurately to realize automatic adjustment of the laser optical axis and long-distance communication.

Manual measurements can have errors; therefore, to reduce the maintenance cost and improve the accuracy of measurement, developing an automatic inspection system is essential. In this study, we propose an automatic inspection system of railcar wheel condition monitoring using laser sensors and image data. The system is developed to replace the existing manual monitoring process for accurate measurements and monitoring.

These overlays can be mapped to using higher level compilers, achieving fast compilation, software-like programmability and run-time management, and high-level design abstraction. OpenCL allows programs running on a host computer to launch accelerator kernels which can be compiled at run-time for a specific architecture, thus enabling portability. However, prohibitive hardware compilation times in traditional design flows mean that the tools cannot effectively use just-in-time (JIT) compilation or runtime performance scaling on FPGAs. We present a methodology for runtime compilation of dataflow graphs expressed as OpenCL kernels onto coarse-grained overlays. The methodology benefits from the high level of abstraction afforded by using the OpenCL programming model, while the mapping to the overlay significantly reduces compilation and load times. Key characteristics of this work include highly performant DSP-optimized functional units that scale to large overlays on modern devices and the ability to perform automatic resource-aware kernel replication up to the size of the overlay. We demonstrate place and route times orders of magnitude better than traditional HLS flows, even when running on an embedded processor in the Xilinx Zynq.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coarse Grained FPGA Overlay for Rapid Just-In-Time Accelerator Compilation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3116859","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9591458/09555373.pdf","startPage":"1478","endPage":"1490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3116859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2022","displayDocTitle":"Coarse Grained FPGA Overlay for Rapid Just-In-Time Accelerator Compilation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9555373/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"1 June 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"MOE2017-T2-1-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Coarse Grained FPGA Overlay for Rapid Just-In-Time Accelerator Compilation","sourcePdf":"tpds-fahmy-3116859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123982S","chronDate":"June 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9591458","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9591458","articleId":"9555373","onlineDate":"30 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9555374,"authors":[{"name":"Weipeng Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Weipeng","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0003-2886-7346"},{"name":"Haifeng Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0002-4884-323X"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9555374","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Prototypes","Feature extraction","Faces","Task analysis","Lighting","Kernel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NIR-VIS face recognition","cross-modal face alignment","domain discrepancy elimination"]}],"abstract":"Due to its potential application in criminal cases, security systems and multimedia information retrieval, Near InfraRed (NIR) to VISible (VIS) face recognition has attracted increasing research attention in the field of computer vision. However, it is still a challenging task because of the large intra-class variations including spectrum, occlusion, lighting, blurry, expression and pose. To address the above problem, we propose a novel Domain discrepancy Elimination and Mean face Representation learning (DEMR) for NIR-VIS face recognition. The DEMR consists of two key components comprising Class-wise Domain Discrepancy Elimination (CDDE) and Cross-modal Mean Face Alignment (CMFA). Specifically, two-branch modality-specific networks are designed to extract features for VIS images and NIR images, respectively. Considering that distribution variations of cross-modal images will decrease recognition performance, we present CDDE to eliminate modality gap by narrowing distribution differences of VIS images and NIR images in a category-by-category manner. Moreover, to reduce the intra-class discrepancies and obtain compact feature representation, the CMFA is designed to achieve representation alignment between cross-domain images and VIS prototypes (i.e., VIS mean face representations), through optimizing a quadruplet constraint. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging NIR-VIS databases validate that our DEMR is effective for cross-modal face recognition task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain Discrepancy Elimination and Mean Face Representation Learning for NIR-VIS Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3116861","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09555374.pdf","startPage":"2068","endPage":"2072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3116861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Domain Discrepancy Elimination and Mean Face Representation Learning for NIR-VIS Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9555374/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62076262, 61673402, 61273270 and 60802069"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain Discrepancy Elimination and Mean Face Representation Learning for NIR-VIS Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"lsp-hu-3116861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181091S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9555374","onlineDate":"30 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9555383,"authors":[{"name":"Venkat Mattela","affiliation":["Advanced Embedded Systems and IC Model Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/9310738/9555383/matte-3115936-small.gif","p":["Venkat Mattela received the M.Tech. degree in computer science from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India.

This paper focuses on real-time car make/model information extraction from highway cameras. As we have very limited access to the real world data due to data privacy and protection, we use open-source data (e.g. car selling websites) and transfer learning on open-source pre-trained models to build a model which is generic enough to be applied directly to similar data sets from other sources, (e.g. real-world highway cameras) without losing much accuracy. To achieve this, we propose applying the object detection method \u2018You Only Look Once\u2019 (Yolo) for classification problem of car make/model. The proposed method and trained model achieve an accuracy of 95.6% when applied directly to real-world highway cameras without using their data for training.","doi":"10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555409","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555400/9553005/09555409.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost effective and Accurate Vehicle Make/Model Recognition method Using YoloV5","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Cost effective and Accurate Vehicle Make/Model Recognition method Using YoloV5","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","accessionNumber":"21202220","publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555409/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost effective and Accurate Vehicle Make/Model Recognition method Using YoloV5","confLoc":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570731805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079753S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555400","isNumber":"9553005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555400","xplore-issue":"9553005","articleId":"9555409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9555416,"authors":[{"name":"Faqeer ur Rehman","affiliation":["Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, USA"],"firstName":"Faqeer ur","lastName":"Rehman","id":"37088958528"},{"name":"Clemente Izurieta","affiliation":["Idaho National Laboratories, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, USA"],"firstName":"Clemente","lastName":"Izurieta","id":"37705696900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3545-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3546-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555416","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Support vector machines","Costs","Neural networks","Computer bugs","Software algorithms","Intrusion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","program testing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical hypothesis testing","neural network-based intrusion detection systems","computational complex machine learning classifiers","neural network-based classifiers","metamorphic testing","prioritized test inputs","test input prioritization techniques","machine learning-based classifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","Machine learning testing","Statistical hypothesis testing","Neural networks","Prioritized inputs","Metamorphic testing","Intrusion detection systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555416","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555400/9553005/09555416.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybridized Approach for Testing Neural Network Based Intrusion Detection Systems","abstract":"Enhancing the trust of machine learning-based classifiers with large input spaces is a desirable goal; however, due to high labeling costs and limited resources, this is a challenging task. One solution is to use test input prioritization techniques that aim to identify and label only the most effective test instances. These prioritized test inputs can then be used with some popular testing techniques e.g., Metamorphic testing (MT) to test and uncover implementation bugs in computationally complex machine learning classifiers that suffer from the oracle problem. However, there are certain limitations involved with this approach, (i) using a small number of prioritized test inputs may not be enough to check the program correctness over a large variety of input scenarios, and (ii) traditional MT approaches become infeasible when the programs under test exhibit a non-deterministic behavior during training e.g., Neural Network-based classifiers. Therefore, instead of using MT for testing purposes, we propose a metamorphic relation to solve a data generation/labeling problem; that is, enhancing the test inputs effectiveness by extending the prioritized test set with new tests without incurring additional labeling costs. Further, we leverage the prioritized test inputs (both source and follow-up data sets) and propose a statistical hypothesis testing (for detection) and machine learning-based approach (for prediction) of faulty behavior in two other machine learning classifiers (Neural Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems). In our case, the problem is interesting in the sense that injected bugs represent the high accuracy producing mutated program versions that may be difficult to detect by a software developer. The results indicate that (i) the proposed statistical hypothesis testing is able to identify the induced buggy behavior, and (ii) Random Forest outperforms and achieves the best performance over SVM and k-NN algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555416/","accessionNumber":"21202225","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9555416/","publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybridized Approach for Testing Neural Network Based Intrusion Detection Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybridized Approach for Testing Neural Network Based Intrusion Detection Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570740098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056667S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555400","isNumber":"9553005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555400","xplore-issue":"9553005","articleId":"9555416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9555418,"authors":[{"name":"Rabia Khan","affiliation":["University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK","University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Rabia","lastName":"Khan","id":"37088982987"},{"name":"Rameez Asif","affiliation":["University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK","University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Rameez","lastName":"Asif","id":"37088478816"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3545-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3546-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555418","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"abstract":"In the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT), big Data analytic and the interconnected world, the scientific revolution is increasing the demand for an improved spectrum utilization. An efficient use of the existing spectrum is required for high data-rate transmission. There are several potential ways of solving the challenges of spectrum scarcity. In-Band Full Duplex (IBFD) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) are two techniques that can improve the spectral efficiency (SE) in a 5G and Beyond (5GB) cellular networks. This paper proposes a spectral efficient IBFD scheme, Reflective In-Band Full-Duplex (R-IBFD) algorithm for relay selection to improve security of the system with minimum interference. The interference is basically reduced by the addition of orthogonality between the transmitted and received signal in the IBFD mode. The proposed R-IBFD is evaluated with IBFD, Device-to-Device (D2D) and Artificial Noise (AN). Secrecy Outage Probability (SOP) and throughput is analysed for R-IBFD. The simulation results present the comparison between the R-IBFD and conventional decode-and-forward IBFD communication with one or more users operated as a relay.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555400/9553005/09555418.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","doi":"10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reflective In-Band Full Duplex NOMA Communications for Secure 5G Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","5G mobile communication","Spectral efficiency","Simulation","Interference","Probability","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial noise","Full Duplex","Reflective In-Band Full Duplex","In-Band Full Duplex","Decode-and-Forward","Secrecy outage probability","secrecy capacity","security and secrecy outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Reflective In-Band Full Duplex NOMA Communications for Secure 5G Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9555418/","publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008078","fundingName":"University of Strathclyde"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reflective In-Band Full Duplex NOMA Communications for Secure 5G Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570720454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07904S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555400","isNumber":"9553005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555400","xplore-issue":"9553005","articleId":"9555418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9555431,"authors":[{"name":"Caolan Deery","affiliation":["Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Letterkenny, Ireland"],"firstName":"Caolan","lastName":"Deery","id":"37088981200"},{"name":"Kevin Meehan","affiliation":["Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Letterkenny, Ireland"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Meehan","id":"37070652500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3545-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3546-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555431","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555431","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Deep learning","Pandemics","Tools","Streaming media","Social factors","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolutional neural nets","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","diseases","epidemics","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN","deep learning","COVID-19 control","convolutional neural network","facemask detection application","COVID-19 pandemic","virus","social distancing","monitoring tool","mask wearing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["COVID-19","Computer Vision","Face Detection","Facemask","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555431","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555400/9553005/09555431.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Deep Learning for COVID-19 Control: Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network in a Facemask Detection Application","abstract":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has changed people\u2019s lives in ways that many would not have predicted. In the days, weeks and months since mandatory lockdowns and restrictions came into effect worldwide, people have had to adjust their daily lives in an effort to slow and restrict the spread of the virus -- like regularly sanitising their hands, maintaining social distancing in crowded places, and wearing facemasks. The latter is contentious for some but has been a necessary deterrent in slowing the spread of this virus. There is potential for utilising technology as a supplementary deterrent and monitoring tool to help detect non-compliance of mask wearing. This research investigates the efficacy of AI for such purposes, exploring the applicability of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for predicting if a person in a real time video feed is wearing a facemask. A dataset of over 10,000 images was created to effectively evaluate this research. The CNN developed was tested against the validation dataset to evaluate its performance, the model demonstrated 98.47% accuracy on a varied and balanced dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555431/","accessionNumber":"21202237","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9555431/","publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Deep Learning for COVID-19 Control: Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network in a Facemask Detection Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Deep Learning for COVID-19 Control: Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network in a Facemask Detection Application","confLoc":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570726075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069535S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555400","isNumber":"9553005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555400","xplore-issue":"9553005","articleId":"9555431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9555433,"authors":[{"name":"Raouia Masmoudi Ghodhbane","affiliation":["Safran Tech, Safran Sensing Systems Applied Research (S3AR), Rue des Jeunes Bois, Ch\u00e2teaufort, 78114 Magny les Hameaux, France"],"firstName":"Raouia Masmoudi","lastName":"Ghodhbane","id":"37087084964"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3545-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3546-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555433","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulation","OFDM","Receivers","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Interference constraints","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sharing strategies","Cognitive Radio","Power Allocation","OFDM","Overlay","Underlay","Mixed strategy","Water-filling solution"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixed Spectrum Sharing Strategy for Cognitive Radio Systems","doi":"10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9553005","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555400/9553005/09555433.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets50376.2021.9555433","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555433","abstract":"This paper deals with a power allocation optimization problem in a Cognitive Radio (CR) system composed of opportunistic unlicensed users called secondary users (SUs) and primary users (PUs) owning the spectrum licence. When the SU is allowed to transmit, these constraints guarantee: a maximum average transmit power and the protection of the PUs by maximum average interference levels at the PUs receivers. We study this optimization problem in a mix between underlay access strategy, where spectrum is always accessible to the SU subject to an interference constraint at the PU, and overlay access strategy where the secondary service accesses to the spectrum only during the idle periods. Thus, we propose a novel algorithm by taking into account the combination between idle and busy periods of the PUs. The performance of the maximum achievable capacity of the SU is illustrated for different interference power parameters. The simulation results show that the underlay behavior of the mixed strategy is dominant for very low interference and for very high interference, the overlay behavior of the mixed strategy is dominant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555433/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Mixed Spectrum Sharing Strategy for Cognitive Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixed Spectrum Sharing Strategy for Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570720757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076353S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555400","isNumber":"9553005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555400","xplore-issue":"9553005","articleId":"9555433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9555438,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal A. \u2018t Hart","affiliation":["QuTech Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Pascal A. \u2018t","lastName":"Hart","id":"37088379657"},{"name":"Job van Staveren","affiliation":["QuTech Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Job","lastName":"van Staveren","id":"37087084682"},{"name":"Fabio Sebastiano","affiliation":["QuTech Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Sebastiano","id":"37567267500"},{"name":"Jianjun Xu","affiliation":["Keysight Laboratories, Keysight Technologies Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37537284700"},{"name":"David E.

Reliable simulation models are required to design complex circuits, but CMOS transistor electrical characteristics at cryogenic temperatures substantially deviate from the behavior at room temperature, and no standard physics-based model exists for cryo-CMOS devices. To circumvent those limitations, this paper proposes the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and an associated training (extraction) procedure that automatically generates cryo-CMOS device models directly from experimental data. A device model for the DC characteristics of 40-nm CMOS transistors over a wide range of bias conditions, device geometries and temperatures from 4 K to 300 K has been generated and used to simulate voltage-reference circuits over a wide temperature range (4 K \u2013 300 K). The potential application to dynamic/high-frequency circuits is demonstrated by enhancing the basic model with ANN-based nonlinear multi-terminal capacitive elements to simulate a ring oscillator.

In the present paper we focus on the application of deep learning, a promising category of technical analysis, and in particular LSTM neural networks. In the context of this paper, stock market forecasts are estimated for large technology companies and the factors affecting their performance are studied. Stock market predictions can significantly benefit from the fusion of different information sources providing insights of diverse types and levels. Here we propose the use of LSTM neural networks in order to fuse different types and levels of information and generate predictions about the future prices and the future stock price trend. Specifically, the proposed LSTM model takes as input the price of the stock under examination along with related indices. Hence, it considers not only the historical price data but also the indices implying changes in the market due to several external influences. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other approaches which consider only the historical price data in terms of the price movement prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"12 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555506/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","conferenceDate":"12-14 July 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stock Trend Prediction by Fusing Prices and Indices with LSTM Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stock Trend Prediction by Fusing Prices and Indices with LSTM Neural Networks","confLoc":"Chania Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06626S","chronDate":"12-14 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555494","isNumber":"9555495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555494","xplore-issue":"9555495","articleId":"9555506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9555520,"authors":[{"name":"Iliana Paliari","affiliation":["Graduate of school of science, Hellenic Open University, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Iliana","lastName":"Paliari","id":"37088988954"},{"name":"Aikaterini Karanikola","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Aikaterini","lastName":"Karanikola","id":"37086412064"},{"name":"Sotiris Kotsiantis","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Sotiris","lastName":"Kotsiantis","id":"37294564900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0033-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555520","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Measurement","Deep learning","Time series analysis","Decision making","Predictive models","Stock markets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Financial Forecasting","Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM)","XGBoost","ARIMA model","Australian Stock Market","Short-term Forecast","Stock Exchange."]}],"abstract":"The term time series refers to historical data comprise of observations that are made in a fixed time step, successively, over a period of time.

One of the current trends contains the integration of various AI tools to improve the proposed solutions. The question that has to be revisited is how tools may be put together to form efficient systems suitable for the problem at hand. This paper frames itself in the area of nuclear security where an agent uses a radiation sensor to survey an area for radiological threats. The main goal of this application is to identify anomalies in the measured data that designate the presence of nuclear material that may consist of a threat. To that end, we propose the integration of two kernel modeled Gaussian processes (GP) by using a fuzzy inference system. The GP models utilize different types of information to make predictions of the background radiation contribution that will be used to identify an anomaly. The integration of the prediction of the two GP models is performed with means of fuzzy rules that provide the degree of existence of anomalous data. The proposed system is tested on a set of real-world gamma-ray spectra taken with a low-resolution portable radiation spectrometer.","doi":"10.1109/IISA52424.2021.9555524","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems & Applications (IISA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems & Applications (IISA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555494/9555495/09555524.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISA52424.2021.9555524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Integration of kernel-based Gaussian Processes applied to Anomaly Detection in Nuclear Security","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555524/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Integration of kernel-based Gaussian Processes applied to Anomaly Detection in Nuclear Security","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"12 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555524/","conferenceDate":"12-14 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Integration of kernel-based Gaussian Processes applied to Anomaly Detection in Nuclear Security","confLoc":"Chania Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051469S","chronDate":"12-14 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555494","isNumber":"9555495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555494","xplore-issue":"9555495","articleId":"9555524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9555533,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolas Giannakis","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolas","lastName":"Giannakis","id":"37088988517"},{"name":"Nikolaos Gorgolis","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Gorgolis","id":"37087089028"},{"name":"Ioannis Hatzilygeroudis","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Hatzilygeroudis","id":"37265420000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0033-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555533","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Costs","Recurrent neural networks","Neural networks","Bayes methods","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Gaussian processes","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["problem-specific dependencies","hyperparameter values","design process","structured stardardized procedure","deep neural networks","neural network architectures","DNNs","Gaussian processes","Bayesian optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bayesian optimization","hyperparameter fine tuning","search for optimal parameters configuration","gaussian processes","deep neural networks","convolutional neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555533","abstract":"The design of deep neural networks (DNNs), which in essence concerns the choice of specific values for their hyperparameters, is a very involved process that provides very big challenges to researchers and designers. The fact that there are strong problem-specific dependencies and intuition/experience has been typically used by the designers, has led to the consideration of it as more of an art issue than a well structured and stardardized procedure. The aim of this work is to introduce some structure on the above design process by considering it as a function to be optimized, which takes as input a specific set of hyperparameter values and returns the accuracy of the designed DNN. The process of Bayesian optimization, using Gaussian processes as modeling functions, is employed to fine tune the hyperparameters of DNNs. We arrived at some very promising results. Comparing the proposed process to the random choice of hyperparameters from a specific set, much better accuracy is achieved at no significant extra time cost. Also, the process produces neural network architectures that mimic very closely the known best performing architectures for specific problem sets within the given constraints.","doi":"10.1109/IISA52424.2021.9555533","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems & Applications (IISA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISA52424.2021.9555533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555495","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems & Applications (IISA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555494/9555495/09555533.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian optimization for the design of deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555533/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bayesian optimization for the design of deep neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9555533/","accessionNumber":"21201263","publicationDate":"12 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","conferenceDate":"12-14 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian optimization for the design of deep neural networks","confLoc":"Chania Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090364S","chronDate":"12-14 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555494","isNumber":"9555495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555494","xplore-issue":"9555495","articleId":"9555533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9555534,"authors":[{"name":"Arne Koschel","affiliation":["Faculty IV, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Arne","lastName":"Koschel","id":"37672694200"},{"name":"Samuel Klassen","affiliation":["Faculty IV, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Klassen","id":"37088988007"},{"name":"Kerim Jdiya","affiliation":["Faculty IV, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Kerim","lastName":"Jdiya","id":"37088989048"},{"name":"Marc Schaaf","affiliation":["Institute of Information Systems University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland, Olten, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Schaaf","id":"37886568700"},{"name":"Irina Astrova","affiliation":["School of IT, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Irina","lastName":"Astrova","id":"37670685000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0033-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555534","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Costs","Codes","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Companies","FAA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["serverless architecture","cloud computing","scaling","serverless functions","service models","BaaS (Backend-as-a-service)","FaaS (Function-as-a-service)"]}],"abstract":"A serverless architecture is a new approach to offering services over the Internet.

Consequently, compressed deep learning models gain momentum recently. Meanwhile, adversarial attacks targeting conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) and compressed DNNs are flouring nowadays. This paper firstly surveys the current compressing techniques, including pruning, distillation, quantization and weights sharing. Then, two iterative adversarial attacks, including I-FGSM (Iterative-Fast Gradient Sign Method) and PGD (Project Gradient Descent), are introduced. Three scenarios are built to test each DNN\u2019s robustness against adversarial attacks. Besides, each DNN is trained with samples generated by different adversarial attacks and is then compressed under different pruning rate and tested under different attacks. The experimental results prove firstly that when a DNN is compressed with pruning rate lower than 70.0% is safe and with tiny accuracy decline. Second, iterative adversarial attacks are effective and cause dramatic performance degradation. Third, adversarial training helps to secure the compressed DNNs while lowering transferability of adversarial samples constructed by different attack algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555552/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","publicationDate":"12 July 2021","accessionNumber":"21201293","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of Compressed Deep Neural Networks with Adversarial Training","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness of Compressed Deep Neural Networks with Adversarial Training","confLoc":"Chania Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071645S","chronDate":"12-14 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555494","isNumber":"9555495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555494","xplore-issue":"9555495","articleId":"9555552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9555558,"authors":[{"name":"Glen Uehara","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Glen","lastName":"Uehara","id":"37088988643"},{"name":"Sunil Rao","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085818544"},{"name":"Mathew Dobson","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Mathew","lastName":"Dobson","id":"37088988493"},{"name":"Cihan Tepedelenlioglu","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Cihan","lastName":"Tepedelenlioglu","id":"37268523100"},{"name":"Andreas Spanias","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Spanias","id":"37279657300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0033-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555558","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic systems","Training","Fault detection","Computational modeling","Qubit","Artificial neural networks","Electrical fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","photovoltaic power systems","power engineering computing","power system faults","power system measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photovoltaic fault detection","solar array monitoring","machine learning","quantum computer system","quantum circuit","PV fault detection","quantum neural network parameter estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555558","abstract":"In this paper, we describe solar array monitoring using various machine learning methods including neural networks.

It has popularly resulted in millions of deer-vehicle collisions claims and fatalities. The only way to prevent the above-saddened statics is to drive wildlife safely away from roadways due to morbidity and injuries. This paper undrapes the optimal comparative study between edge-based image segmentation and CNN-HOG for self-acting animal detection. As the fatal crashes peaks during night-time, night vision image detection is focused on this paper with the mounted camera in the vehicle. Edge-based image segmentation is applied to the intelligent animal detection system to demonstrate the prowess of animal detection. The intelligent system processes thermographic images and feature extractions used for the object existence prediction. Deer is the overly populated animal and most commonly spotted animal used as the subject of detection in this research. The animal detection is done using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) transform, whereas optimization is demonstrated using image segmentation. Image segmentation helps in precise animal detection by extending the continuity of the images, which is crucial for image processing during detection. The results vividly conclude the contribution of image segmentation accuracy to the existing HOG-based intelligent system with 91% accuracy using the wide roadsides of San Antonio, TX, in the USA.","doi":"10.1109/IISA52424.2021.9555562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISA52424.2021.9555562","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems & Applications (IISA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems & Applications (IISA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555494/9555495/09555562.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Image segmentation, HOG and CNN Techniques for the Animal Detection using Thermography Images in Automobile Applications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555562/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","publicationDate":"12 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Image segmentation, HOG and CNN Techniques for the Animal Detection using Thermography Images in Automobile Applications","confLoc":"Chania Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.225822S","chronDate":"12-14 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555494","isNumber":"9555495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555494","xplore-issue":"9555495","articleId":"9555562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9555564,"authors":[{"name":"Sunil Rao","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085818544"},{"name":"Vivek Narayanaswamy","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Narayanaswamy","id":"37086863990"},{"name":"Michael Esposito","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Esposito","id":"37088987863"},{"name":"Jayaraman Thiagarajan","affiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Labs"],"firstName":"Jayaraman","lastName":"Thiagarajan","id":"37392160300"},{"name":"Andreas Spanias","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Spanias","id":"37279657300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0033-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555564","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Deep learning","Sensitivity","Pipelines","Tools","Predictive models","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["COVID-19","acoustics","machine learning","respiratory diagnosis","healthcare"]}],"abstract":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, rapid non-invasive testing has become essential.

We utilize features directly extracted from the coughing audio and use deep learning algorithms to develop automated diagnostic tools for COVID-19. In particular, we develop a unique modification of the VGG13 deep learning architecture for audio analysis that uses log-mel spectrograms and a combination of binary cross entropy and focal losses. This unique modification enabled the model to achieve highly robust classification of the DiCOVA 2021 COVID-19 data. We also explore the use of data augmentation and an ensembling strategy to further improve the performance on the validation and the blind test datasets.

Most real datasets include an irregular subset with higher variance than most data, and predictive models do not learn well from these datasets. While most existing prediction models learned from the whole or randomly sampled training datasets, our suggested method draws up training datasets by separating regular and highly biased subsets to build accurate prediction models. We use a two-step approach to prepare the training dataset: (1) divide the initial training dataset into two groups, commonly distributed and highly biased using Principal Component Analysis, (2) enrich the highly biased group by Variational Autoencoders. Then, two deep neural network classifiers learn from the isolated training groups separately. The well-organized training groups enable a chance to build more accurate prediction models. When predicting the risk of coronary heart disease from the given input, only one appropriate model is selected based on the reconstruction error on the Principal Component Analysis model. Dataset used in this study was collected from the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. We have conducted two types of experiments on the dataset. The first one proved how Principal Component Analysis and Variational Autoencoder models of the proposed method improves the performance of a single deep neural network. The second experiment compared the proposed method with existing machine learning algorithms, including Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Adaptive Boosting. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed conventional machine learning algorithms by giving the accuracy of 0.892, specificity of 0.840, precision of 0.911, recall of 0.920, f-measure of 0.915, and AUC of 0.882.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555589/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555589/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","volume":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Prediction Method for Coronary Heart Disease Risk Based on Two Deep Neural Networks Trained on Well-Ordered Training Datasets","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning","grantNumber":"2019K2A9A2A06020672 and 2020R1A2B5B02001717"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61802209"},{"fundingName":"Open Fund of Tianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics/Tianjin Key Laboratory of Human Development and Reproductive Regulation","grantNumber":"2020XHY03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Efficient Prediction Method for Coronary Heart Disease Risk Based on Two Deep Neural Networks Trained on Well-Ordered Training Datasets","sourcePdf":"access-ryu-3116974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14576S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9555589","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9555591,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhao Xu","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of Industrial Spectrum Imaging, School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Knowledge Automation for Industrial Processes of Ministry of Education, School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","Shunde Graduate School, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Foshan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/9650682/9555591/xu-3116937-small.gif","p":["Jinhao Xu received the B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, China, in 2019, where he is currently pursuing the M.Sc. degree with the School of Automation and Electrical Engineering.

In this paper, we use model-driven and data-driven methods to establish a soft sensor, which combines computational fluid dynamics and multilayer perceptrons to predict the temperature field of the rotary kiln. The soft sensor takes axial air speed, swirling air speed, coal mass flow, material mass flow, secondary air temperature, and x, y, z coordinates as the inputs while the temperature at a certain position inside the kiln as the output. The proposed method has been tested on real industrial data. Compared to CFD simulation, the soft sensor reduces the computation time by three orders of magnitude from 3002.60s to 0.55s.

For this reason, the determination of the exact diffracted fields is also crucial especially in the edge or discontinuity points of these types of materials. In the paper, the discontinuity problem by the junction between the layers of an anomalously reflecting metasurface and an impedance half-screen is taken into consideration. These two planar layers have a common edge discontinuity where the diffracted waves occur. The scattered waves from the structure are obtained by the novel technique of the method of transition boundary, which especially offers the relation between the diffracted and scattered geometrical optical waves at the transition boundaries. The diffracted wave expressions are derived by the technique of the method of transition boundary and the uniform wave expressions are obtained by the method of uniform geometrical theory of diffraction. The diffracted and total wave results of the method of transition boundary are also compared and verified by the well-known theory of physical optics. The behaviors of the total wave and its components are analyzed numerically.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09555593.pdf","startPage":"135689","endPage":"135696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wave Scattering by a Planar Junction Between Anomalously Reflecting Metasurface and Impedance Sheets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555593/","displayDocTitle":"Wave Scattering by a Planar Junction Between Anomalously Reflecting Metasurface and Impedance Sheets","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9555593/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)","grantNumber":"2211-A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wave Scattering by a Planar Junction Between Anomalously Reflecting Metasurface and Impedance Sheets","sourcePdf":"access-celik-3116998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091711S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9555593","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":9555607,"authors":[{"name":"Praveen Pawar","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9555607/pawar-3116947-small.gif","p":["Praveen Pawar (Member, IEEE) received the M.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in wireless communication from Atal Bihari Vajpayee-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, India, in 2013 and 2020, respectively.","In 2020, he joined the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bhopal, India, where he is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering.

In particular, the proposed JUDRA approach allows DUs to reuse either uplink or downlink CUs\u2019 resources. Besides, an optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) which is generally NP-hard. The problem is solved in two stages: sub-channel (SC) assignment stage and power allocation stage by utilizing the characteristics of sequential geometric programming. Moreover, a low computational complexity approach is suggested that converges to the near-optimal solution in polynomial time.

It has been noted that the approximate multiplier can be used in the convolution of CNN\u2019s forward path. However, in CNN inference on a post-training quantization with a pre-trained model, erroneous convolution output from highly approximate multipliers significantly degrades performance. On the other hand, with the CNN model based on an approximate multiplier, the approximation-aware training process can optimize its learnable parameters, producing better classification results considering the approximate hardware. We analyze the error distribution of the approximate dynamic ranged multiplication and characterize it in order to find the most suitable approximate multiplier design. Considering the effects of normalizing the biased convolution outputs, a low standard deviation of relative errors with respect to the multiplication outputs leads to a negligible accuracy drop. Based on these facts, the hardware costs of the proposed multiplier can be further reduced by adopting the partial products\u2019 inaccurate compression, truncated input fraction, and reduced-width multiplication output. When the proposed approximate multiplier is applied to the residual convolutional neural networks for the CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, the accuracy drops of the approximation-aware training results are negligible compared with those using 32-bit floating-point CNNs.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555631","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Convolutional neural networks","Dynamic range","Hardware","Convolution","Costs","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate computing","approximate multiplier","approximation-aware training","convolutional neural network","probabilistic multiplier"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09555631.pdf","startPage":"135513","endPage":"135525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117148","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cost-Efficient Approximate Dynamic Ranged Multiplication and Approximation-Aware Training on Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555631/","displayDocTitle":"A Cost-Efficient Approximate Dynamic Ranged Multiplication and Approximation-Aware Training on Convolutional Neural Networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555631/","volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Korea Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)]","grantNumber":"2021R1F1A1048054"},{"fundingName":"\u2018\u2018HPC Support\u2019\u2019 Project"},{"fundingName":"\u2018\u2018Ministry of Science and ICT\u2019\u2019 and National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA)"},{"fundingName":"CM","grantNumber":"S2018/TCS-4423"},{"fundingName":"EU [Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)] and the Spanish Ministerio de Asuntos Econ\u00f3micos y Transformaci\u00f3n Digital (MINECO)","grantNumber":"RTI2018-093684-B-I00"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005142","fundingName":"Fundacion Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA)","grantNumber":"PR2003_20/01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Cost-Efficient Approximate Dynamic Ranged Multiplication and Approximation-Aware Training on Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-kim-3117148-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093201S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9555631","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9555639,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Sung Jung","affiliation":["Convergence Engineering for Intelligent Drone, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9555639/jung-3116959-small.gif","p":["Ji-Sung Jung received the B.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2020, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, and Convergence Engineering for Intelligent Drone.

IRS composed of low-cost reflecting elements is expected to be used in various scenarios in future wireless communication systems. It can be used even when the direct path is blocked by obstacles. Since the reflecting elements can only adjust the phase, the design of IRS matrix causes a non-convex problem. In this paper, the proposed schemes perform optimization by transforming a non-convex problem into a solvable convex function. Typically, base station-IRS (BS-IRS) channel can be assumed as the line-of-sight (LOS) channel environment. In this case, multi-user system suffers from performance degradation due to the LOS channel rank problem. To alleviate this problem, this paper considers deterministic scattering and sufficient spacing between the reflecting elements of the IRS. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve better SE performance than the randomly generated IRS scheme. In addition, the proposed minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based scheme can achieve high performance compared to other schemes even in a low-rank channel environment.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09555639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"134695","endPage":"134702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Spectral Efficiency Maximization in the Multi-User MISO Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Spectral Efficiency Maximization in the Multi-User MISO Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555639/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)/Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) (A Research on Core Technology of Autonomous Twins for Metaverse)","grantNumber":"IITP-2021-0-01816"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2020R1A6A1A03038540"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Spectral Efficiency Maximization in the Multi-User MISO Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"access-song-3116959-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060076S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9555639","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":9555643,"authors":[{"name":"Hongchao Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"p":["Hongchao Zhou (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in physics and mathematics and M.Sc. degree in control science and engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

In this paper, we extend this work from point-to-point to networks. We consider a connected network with pairwise communication between the nodes and assume that each node is provided with a certain amount of secret bits before communication commences. An eavesdropper with unlimited computing power has access to all communication and can hack a subset of the nodes not known to the rest of the nodes. We investigate the limits on information-theoretic secure communication with end-to-end encryption for this network. We establish a tradeoff between the secure channel rate (for a node pair) and the secure network rate (sum over all node pair rates) and show that information-theoretic secrecy can be achieved asymptotically if and only if the sum rate of any subset of unhacked channels does not exceed the shared unhacked-secret-bit rate of these channels. We also propose a practical scheme that achieves a good balance of network and channel rates with information-theoretic secrecy guarantee. This work has a wide range of potential applications for which strong secrecy is desired, such as cyber-physical systems, distributed-control systems, and ad-hoc networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Information Theoretic Security With Omnipresent Eavesdropping","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3116962","endPage":"8299","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9622121/09555643.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"8280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3116962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555643","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Ad hoc networks","Receivers","Network security","Random sequences","Network coding","Eavesdropping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network information theoretic security","all communication eavesdropped","network capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network Information Theoretic Security With Omnipresent Eavesdropping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9555643/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Information Theoretic Security With Omnipresent Eavesdropping","sourcePdf":"tit-zhou-3116962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112729S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9622121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9622121","articleId":"9555643","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9555650,"authors":[{"name":"Tahsi\u0307n C.

In this work, we study an intrusion detection system (IDS) which detects anomalies in vehicular CAN bus traffic by analyzing message identifier sequences. We collected CAN bus data from a heavy-duty truck over a period of several months. First, we identify the properties of CAN bus traffic which enable the described approach, and demonstrate that they hold in different datasets collected from different vehicles. Then, we perform an experimental study of the IDS, using the collected CAN bus data and procedurally generated attacks. We analyze the performance of the IDS, considering various attack types and hyperparameter values. The analysis yields promising sensitivity and specificity values, as well as very fast decision times and acceptable memory footprint.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117038","publicationTitle":"IEEE

address the safety of data-driven control for contact-rich manipulation. We propose to restrict the controller\u2019s action space to keep the system in a set of safe states. In the absence of an analytical model, we show how Gaussian Processes (GP) can be used to approximate safe sets. We disable inputs for which the predicted states are likely to be unsafe using the GP. Furthermore, we show how locally designed feedback controllers can be used to improve the execution precision in the presence of modelling errors. We demonstrate the benefits of our method on a pushing task with a variety of dynamics, by using known and unknown surfaces and different object loads. Our results illustrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance and safety of the baseline controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555680/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"19 July 2021","accessionNumber":"21226684","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Safe Data-Driven Contact-Rich Manipulation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safe Data-Driven Contact-Rich Manipulation","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106829S","chronDate":"19-21 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555758","isNumber":"9555669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555758","xplore-issue":"9555669","articleId":"9555680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9555692,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Anh Mac","affiliation":["American School of Warsaw, Bielawa, Poland"],"firstName":"Nguyen Anh","lastName":"Mac","id":"37088987578"},{"name":"Hung Son Nguyen","affiliation":["University of Warsaw, Warszawa, Poland"],"firstName":"Hung Son","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37557434000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-959183-6-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2942-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555692","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Computer science","Convolution","Memory management","Machine learning","Feature extraction","Graph neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","feature extraction","graph theory","grid computing","image processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotation variance","convolution filters","deep convolutional networks","rotation variant behavior","learned invariant behavior","grid-based graph convolutional network","spectral graph convolutions","graph neural networks","Grid-GCN","rotated images"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555692","abstract":"Convolution filters in deep convolutional networks display rotation variant behavior. While learned invariant behavior can be partially achieved, this paper shows that current methods of utilizing rotation variant features can be improved by proposing a grid-based graph convolutional network. By performing spectral graph convolutions on features extracted from subareas of images, we are able to take advantage of the geometric nature of relational machine learning in graph neural networks to be able to overcome rotation variant features to perform object localization. We demonstrate that Grid-GCN heavily outperforms existing models on rotated images, and through a set of ablation studies, we show how the performance of Grid-GCN implies that there exist more performant methods to utilize fundamentally rotation variant features and we conclude that the inherit nature of spectral graph convolutions is able to learn invariant behavior.","doi":"10.15439/2021F140","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555668/9555483/09555692.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"90","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 16th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS)","publicationTitle":"2021 16th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.15439/2021F140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotation Variance in Graph Convolutional Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Rotation Variance in Graph Convolutional Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","accessionNumber":"21201226","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555692/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotation Variance in Graph Convolutional Networks","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11194S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555668","isNumber":"9555483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555668","xplore-issue":"9555483","articleId":"9555692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Polish Information Processing Society","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9555730,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Goudarzi","affiliation":["The Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Goudarzi","id":"38014093900"},{"name":"Marimuthu Palaniswami","affiliation":["The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Marimuthu","lastName":"Palaniswami","id":"38320621600"},{"name":"Rajkumar Buyya","affiliation":["The Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Buyya","id":"37267557900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-959183-6-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2942-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555730","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer science","Energy consumption","Costs","Computational modeling","Collaboration","Internet of Things","Servers"]}],"abstract":"Fog/Edge computing model allows harnessing of resources in the proximity of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices to support various types of latency-sensitive IoT applications. However, due to the mobility of users and a wide range of IoT applications with different resource requirements, it is a challenging issue to satisfy these applications\u2019 requirements. The execution of IoT applications exclusively on one fog/edge server may not be always feasible due to limited resources, while the execution of IoT applications on different servers requires further collaboration and management among servers. Moreover, considering user mobility, some modules of each IoT application may require migration to other servers for execution, leading to service interruption and extra execution costs. In this article, we propose a new weighted cost model for hierarchical fog computing environments, in terms of the response time of IoT applications and energy consumption of IoT devices, to minimize the cost of running IoT applications and potential migrations. Besides, a distributed clustering technique is proposed to enable the collaborative execution of tasks, emitted from application modules, among servers. Also, we propose an application placement technique to minimize the overall cost of executing IoT applications on multiple servers in a distributed manner. Furthermore, a distributed migration management technique is proposed for the potential migration of applications\u2019 modules to other remote servers as the users move along their path. Besides, failure recovery methods are embedded in the clustering, application placement, and migration management techniques to recover from unpredicted failures. The performance results demonstrate that our technique significantly improves its counterparts in terms of placement deployment time, average execution cost of tasks, the total number of migrations, the total number of interrupted tasks, and cumulative migration cost.","doi":"10.15439/2021F005","publicationTitle":"2021 16th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 16th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555668/9555483/09555730.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.15439/2021F005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Application Placement and Migration Management Techniques for Edge and Fog Computing Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555730/","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Application Placement and Migration Management Techniques for Edge and Fog Computing Environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555730/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Application Placement and Migration Management Techniques for Edge and Fog Computing Environments","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11659S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555668","isNumber":"9555483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555668","xplore-issue":"9555483","articleId":"9555730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Polish Information Processing Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9555750,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej \u015awiechowski","affiliation":["QED Software, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"\u015awiechowski","id":"37085417068"},{"name":"Tomasz Tajmajer","affiliation":["Poland and QED Software, Institute of Informatics University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tajmajer","id":"38468505600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-959183-6-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2942-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555750","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer science","Monte Carlo methods","Games","Complexity theory","Artificial intelligence","Guidelines"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides practical guidelines for developing strong AI agents based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm in a game with imperfect information and/or randomness.

Circuit-level countermeasures against power/EM SCA include a current equalizer, IVR, non-linear LDOs, enhancing protection up to 10M traces, and current-domain signature attenuation (CDSA), and randomized NL-LDO cascaded with arithmetic countermeasures achieved protection up to >1B. This work embraces the concept of analog CDSA but makes it easily scalable over technology nodes with digital-friendly current sources, digital control loop, and digital bleed path to increase the MTD from 10M to 250M (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$25\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n improvement, using a single digital countermeasure). Ring oscillator (RO) used as the bleed path to bypass encryption-dependent leakage acts as local negative feedback (LNFB). Besides, based on RO oscillation frequency, AES node voltage can be tuned at startup, PVT, or frequency variation. Thus, RO acts as integrated LNFB and global feedback for the digital signature attenuation circuit (DSAC). Another circuit technique, namely, the time-varying transfer function (TVTF), removes the requirement of dc bias in the current-domain equalizer (best switch capacitor-based countermeasure till date) to make it digital and utilizes switch cap-based circuit for time-domain obfuscation to achieve enhanced security. This work, namely, Syn-STELLAR: SYNthesis-friendly Signature aTtenuation Embedded crypto with Low-Level metAl Routing, combines both DSAC and TVTF techniques to achieve an MTD > 1.25B for both EM and power SCA, which is 25% higher than the existing state of the art. The 65-nm CMOS test chip contains unprotected and both the protected (DSAC and DSAC-TVTF) parallel AES-256 implementation. This implementation is the first synthesis-friendly countermeasure, which converges two analog-type strong protections (signature attenuation and switched cap current equalizer) in a digital-friendly solution and achieves > 1.25B MTD with power and area overheads comparable to previous circuit-level countermeasures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

important branch of deep learning in graph structure. As a model that can reveal deep topological information, GNNs has been widely used in various learning tasks, including physical system, protein interface prediction, disease classification, learning molecular fingerprints and so on. However, in most of these tasks, the graph data we are working with may be noisy and may contain spurious edges. That is to say, there is a lot of uncertainty associated with the underlying graph structure. The method of modeling uncertainty is to use Bayesian framework, in which graph is regarded as random variable. Introducing Bayesian framework into graph-based model, especially for semi-supervised node classification, has been shown that it can produce higher classification accuracy. In this paper, some GNNs models and Bayesian neural networks are introduced to better understand how GNNs are combined with Bayesian. Then, the development of Bayesian graph neural networks(BGNNs) in recent years is summarized, and its application in the field of engineering technology is demonstrated. Finally, the future development of BGNNs is prospected and the full text is summarized.","doi":"10.1109/IHMSC52134.2021.00044","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555840/9555939/09555949.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"161","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC)","publicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHMSC52134.2021.00044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Bayesian Graph Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Bayesian Graph Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","accessionNumber":"21200774","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555949/","conferenceDate":"21-22 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Bayesian Graph Neural Networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"283600a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075003S","chronDate":"21-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555840","isNumber":"9555939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555840","xplore-issue":"9555939","articleId":"9555949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9555951,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Scheinert","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Scheinert","id":"37088958914"},{"name":"Lauritz Thamsen","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Lauritz","lastName":"Thamsen","id":"38244801200"},{"name":"Houkun Zhu","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Houkun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37088993480"},{"name":"Jonathan Will","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Will","id":"37088810013"},{"name":"Alexander Acker","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Acker","id":"37086327526"},{"name":"Thorsten Wittkopp","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Wittkopp","id":"37088527691"},{"name":"Odej Kao","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Odej","lastName":"Kao","id":"37283390700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9666-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9667-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1552-5244"}],"articleNumber":"9555951","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555951","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Runtime","Computational modeling","Clustering algorithms","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scalable Data Analytics","Distributed Dataflows","Performance Modeling","Runtime Prediction","Resource Allocation","Resource Management"]}],"abstract":"Distributed dataflow systems enable the use of clusters for scalable data analytics. However, selecting appropriate cluster resources for a processing job is often not straightforward. Performance models trained on historical executions of a concrete job are helpful in such situations, yet they are usually bound to a specific job execution context (e.g. node type, software versions, job parameters) due to the few considered input parameters. Even in case of slight context changes, such supportive models need to be retrained and cannot benefit from historical execution data from related contexts.This paper presents Bellamy, a novel modeling approach that combines scale-outs, dataset sizes, and runtimes with additional descriptive properties of a dataflow job. It is thereby able to capture the context of a job execution. Moreover, Bellamy is realizing a two-step modeling approach. First, a general model is trained on all the available data for a specific scalable analytics algorithm, hereby incorporating data from different contexts. Subsequently, the general model is optimized for the specific situation at hand, based on the available data for the concrete context. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets consisting of execution data from various dataflow jobs carried out in different environments, showing that Bellamy outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555841/9555930/09555951.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00052","doi":"10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bellamy: Reusing Performance Models for Distributed Dataflow Jobs Across Contexts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bellamy: Reusing Performance Models for Distributed Dataflow Jobs Across Contexts","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9555951/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9555951/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009950","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bellamy: Reusing Performance Models for Distributed Dataflow Jobs Across Contexts","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"966600a261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073728S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555841","isNumber":"9555930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555841","xplore-issue":"9555930","articleId":"9555951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9555964,"authors":[{"name":"Zezhong Pan","affiliation":["East China Normal University, ECNU, Shanghai, People\u2019s Republic of China"],"firstName":"Zezhong","lastName":"Pan","id":"37088988562"},{"name":"Wenchao Xu","affiliation":["East China Normal University, ECNU, Shanghai, People\u2019s Republic of China"],"firstName":"Wenchao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085888431"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2836-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2837-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9555964","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555964","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Analytical models","Sentiment analysis","Epidemics","Computational modeling","Blogs","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","feature extraction","health care","pattern classification","regression analysis","sentiment analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning based sentiment analysis","public health emergency","text sentiment analysis","sentiment dictionary method","labor cost","traditional machine learning methods","salient features","low classification accuracy","model BERT_RCNN","input text","trained vectors","upstream model","microblog text","RCNN network","naive Bayesian model","deep learning models BERT_Bi-LSTM","BERT_FC","BERT_DPCNN","shorter training time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BERT","ERNIE","SVM","RCNN","sentiment analysis","Microblog short text"]}],"abstract":"The traditional method of text sentiment analysis mainly uses sentiment dictionary or machine learning, but sentiment dictionary method needs to update the thesaurus in time for microblog, which is noisy, has many new words, uses abbreviations to express emotions and the labor cost is high.

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a model BERT_RCNN for sentiment analysis of netizens during public health emergency based on deep learning. BERT_RCNN first uses BERT to fine tune the input text, and trains the text into vectors to represent it. Then it takes the trained vectors as the input features of the upstream model and learns the microblog text features through RCNN network. Experiments show that: The accuracy of BERT_RCNN is 91.80%, which is better than 72.74% of SVM, 72.03% of logistic regression and 68.95% of naive Bayesian model. Better than other deep learning models BERT_Bi-LSTM, BERT_FC, BERT_DPCNN, ERNIE_FC with higher accuracy. Because it has faster convergence speed and shorter training time.

Unsurprisingly, there has been significant interest in adopting deep learning at a very large scale on supercomputing infrastructures for a variety of scientific applications. A key issue in this context is how to find an appropriate model architecture that is suitable to solve the problem. We call this the neural architecture search (NAS) problem. Over time, many automated approaches have been proposed that can explore a large number of candidate models. However, this remains a time-consuming and resource expensive process: the candidates are often trained from scratch for a small number of epochs in order to obtain a set of top-K best performers, which are fully trained in a second phase. To address this problem, we propose a novel method that leverages checkpoints of previously discovered candidates to accelerate NAS. Based on the observation that the candidates feature high structural similarity, we propose the idea that new candidates need not be trained starting from random weights, but rather from the weights of similar layers of previously evaluated candidates. Thanks to this approach, the convergence of the candidate models can be significantly accelerated and produces candidates that are statistically better based on the objective metrics. Furthermore, once the top-K models are identified, our approach provides a significant speed-up (1.4 ~ 1.5 \u00d7 on the average) for the full training.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating DNN Architecture Search at Scale Using Selective Weight Transfer","doi":"10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00051","startPage":"82","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555930","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555841/9555930/09556005.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating DNN Architecture Search at Scale Using Selective Weight Transfer","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556005/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006132","fundingName":"Office of Science"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006192","fundingName":"Advanced Scientific Computing Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating DNN Architecture Search at Scale Using Selective Weight Transfer","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"966600a082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139333S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555841","isNumber":"9555930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555841","xplore-issue":"9555930","articleId":"9556005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556033,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenlun Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhenlun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085435477"},{"name":"Xuewen Wei","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuewen","lastName":"Wei","id":"37088213138"},{"name":"Meiling Qiu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Meiling","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37087003076"},{"name":"Kunquan Shi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kunquan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37087005383"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2836-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2837-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9556033","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556033","abstract":"A quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization with self-adaptive elitist crossover (EXQPSO) is proposed in this paper.

Although many compute clusters already use learning accelerators or GPUs, HPC storage systems are not suitable for the I/O requirements of DL workflows. Therefore, users typically copy the whole training data to the worker nodes or distribute partitions. Because DL depends on randomized input data, prior work stated that partitioning impacts DL accuracy. Their solutions focused mainly on training I/O performance on a high-speed network but did not cover the data stage-in process, for example. We show in this paper that, in practice, (unbiased) partitioning is not harmful for distributed DL accuracy. Nevertheless, manual partitioning can be error prone and inefficient. Typically, data must be unpacked and shuffled before it is distributed to nodes. We propose a solution that features both: efficient stage-in and fast access to a global namespace to prevent biases. Our architecture is based around an ad hoc storage system relying on a high-speed interconnect allowing an efficient stage-in of DL data sets into a single global namespace. Our proposed solution does not limit access to parts of the data set or relies on data duplication, also relieving the HPC storage system. We obtain high I/O performance during training and ensure minimal interference with communication of the learning workers. The optimizations are transparent to DL applications and their accuracy is not affected by our architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Streamlining distributed Deep Learning I/O with ad hoc file systems","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","doi":"10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00062","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555841/9555930/09556043.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Streamlining distributed Deep Learning I/O with ad hoc file systems","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556043/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007170","fundingName":"Ministry of Economy"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002809","fundingName":"Generalitat de Catalunya"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streamlining distributed Deep Learning I/O with ad hoc file systems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"966600a169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095255S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555841","isNumber":"9555930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555841","xplore-issue":"9555930","articleId":"9556043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9556044,"authors":[{"name":"Qingxiao Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, Beijing, China","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qingxiao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37087083980"},{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085689115"},{"name":"Hailong Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, Beijing, China","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Yang","id":"38239064700"},{"name":"Zhonghui Jiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghui","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37088993110"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088542798"},{"name":"Ming Dun","affiliation":["School of Cyber Science and Technology, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Dun","id":"37087029566"},{"name":"Zhongzhi Luan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongzhi","lastName":"Luan","id":"37303834600"},{"name":"Depei Qian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Depei","lastName":"Qian","id":"37289498500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9666-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9667-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1552-5244"}],"articleNumber":"9556044","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Costs","Tensors","Conferences","Graphics processing units","Computer architecture","Hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stencil computation","GPU","Auto-tuning","Machine learning","Statistics","Genetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The computational patterns of stencil operations are commonly used in HPC applications. Many HPC platforms utilize the computation capability of GPUs to accelerate stencil operations. In recent years, stencils have become more complex in terms of stencil order, memory accesses, and operator patterns. To adapt complex stencils to GPUs, various optimization techniques have been proposed such as blocking and unrolling. However, due to the complexity of GPU architecture, no single parameter setting of the optimization techniques fits all stencils. To address this problem, we propose csTuner, a scalable auto-tuning framework that quickly determines the optimal parameter setting for a given combination of optimization techniques. Specifically, csTuner leverages a set of statistics and machine learning methods to generate parameter groups and sampled parameter settings from the search space. In addition, csTuner adopts the genetic algorithm with approximation to reduce the cost of evolutionary search. The experimental results show that csTuner can find better performing settings with higher auto-tuning speed compared to the state-of-the-art works.","doi":"10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00037","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555841/9555930/09556044.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555930","startPage":"192","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"csTuner: Scalable Auto-tuning Framework for Complex Stencil Computation on GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"csTuner: Scalable Auto-tuning Framework for Complex Stencil Computation on GPUs","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556044/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556044/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011347","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"csTuner: Scalable Auto-tuning Framework for Complex Stencil Computation on GPUs","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"966600a192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143228S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555841","isNumber":"9555930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555841","xplore-issue":"9555930","articleId":"9556044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":9556053,"authors":[{"name":"Brad Green","affiliation":["Clemson University, Clemson, SC"],"firstName":"Brad","lastName":"Green","id":"37088992097"},{"name":"Dillon Todd","affiliation":["Clemson University, Clemson, SC"],"firstName":"Dillon","lastName":"Todd","id":"37088992500"},{"name":"Jon C.

The advantages of our methods are that they do not introduce any extra preconditioner or sparse matrix vector product kernels in order to provide the overlap and can work with preconditioned, unpreconditioned and natural norms of the residual, as opposed to the state-of-the-art methods. We compare our method with other pipelined CG methods for Poisson problems and demonstrate that our method gives the least runtimes. Our method gives up to 2.9x speedup over PCG method, 2.15x speedup over PIPECG method and 1.2x speedup over PIPECG-OATI method at large number of cores.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556061/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556061/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","accessionNumber":"21226761","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined Preconditioned s-step Conjugate Gradient Methods for Distributed Memory Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined Preconditioned s-step Conjugate Gradient Methods for Distributed Memory Systems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"966600a215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091995S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555841","isNumber":"9555930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555841","xplore-issue":"9555930","articleId":"9556061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":9556074,"authors":[{"name":"Nick Brown","affiliation":["The Bayes Centre, 47 Potterrow, EPCC at the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Brown","id":"37086147601"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9666-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9667-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1552-5244"}],"articleNumber":"9556074","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Reconfigurable architectures, such as FPGAs, execute code at the electronics level, avoiding assumptions imposed by the general purpose black-box micro-architectures of CPUs and GPUs. Such tailored execution can result in increased performance and power efficiency, and as the HPC community moves towards exascale an important question is the role these hardware technologies can play in future supercomputers.In this paper we explore the porting of the PW advection kernel, an important code component used in a variety of atmospheric simulations and accounting for around 40% of the runtime of the popular Met Office NERC Cloud model (MONC). Building upon previous work which ported this kernel to an older generation of Xilinx FPGA, we target latest generation Xilinx Alveo U280 and Intel Stratix 10 FPGAs. Designing around the abstraction of an Application Specific Dataflow Machine (ASDM), we develop a design which is performance portable between vendors and explore implementation differences between the tool chains and compare kernel performance between FPGA hardware. This is followed by a more general performance comparison, scaling up the number of kernels on the Xilinx Alveo and Intel Stratix 10, against a 24 core Xeon Platinum Cascade Lake CPU and NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. When overlapping the transfer of data to and from the boards with compute, the FPGA solutions considerably outperform the CPU and, whilst falling short of the GPU in terms of performance, demonstrate power usage benefits, with the Alveo being especially power efficient. The result of this work is a comparison and set of design techniques that apply both to this specific atmospheric advection kernel on Xilinx and Intel FPGAs, and that are also of interest more widely when looking to accelerate HPC codes on a variety of reconfigurable architectures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9555841/9555930/09556074.pdf","startPage":"767","endPage":"774","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","doi":"10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Cluster48925.2021.00113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9555930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating advection for atmospheric modelling on Xilinx and Intel FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Atmospheric modeling","Graphics processing units","Tools","Hardware","Reconfigurable architectures","Kernel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alveo U280","FPGAs","CFD","advection","MONC","High Level Synthesis","Scientific computing","HPC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating advection for atmospheric modelling on Xilinx and Intel FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556074/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating advection for atmospheric modelling on Xilinx and Intel FPGAs","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"966600a767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053493S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9555841","isNumber":"9555930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9555841","xplore-issue":"9555930","articleId":"9556074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9556101,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Yu Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tiangong University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Han-Yu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37088987466"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2836-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2837-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9556101","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556101","abstract":"This paper mainly studies the problem of finite-time topology identification for multi-weighted coupled neural networks with and without parameter uncertainties.

Malicious nodes use multiple false identities obtained through illegal methods to communicate with the network to perform various types of attacks on the system. In response to this problem, a Sybil detection method based on Timestamp-Chain is proposed. When the vehicle passes through the road side unit (RSU), it applies for a time stamp from the RSU to form a Timestamp-Chain. When a vehicle receives a message, it calculates the distance from the vehicle that sent the message based on the received signal strength indication (RSSI), and compares it with the distance calculated from its claimed location. If it exceeds a given threshold, it will be added to the local revocation list (LRL). RSU detects the similarity between the historical track of the vehicle and other vehicles according to the Timestamp-Chain, and further determines whether the vehicle in the local revocation list is a Sybil node.

The temporal and spatial limitations of human observation have motivated significant efforts to develop technology for bird song and vocalization detection and classification. While solutions based on signal processing and machine learning are extant, they are limited in various combinations of speed, computational complexity, and memory use, as well as in detection/classification capability in real-world conditions. This paper introduces ToucaNet, a deep neural network for birdsong detection based on transfer-learning, a deep learning mechanism allowing us to exploit knowledge acquired on various tasks: this enables us to speed up training and shows improved detection accuracy. ToucaNet provides birdsong detection accuracy in line with the best solutions in the literature but with much less computational complexity and memory demand. We also introduce BarbNet, an approximated version of ToucaNet tailored for Internet-of-Things (IoT) units. We show the proposed solution\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency in terms of detection accuracy and the implementation feasibility in real-world IoT devices, with specific results for the STM32 Nucleo H7 board, which is based on an ARM Cortex-M7 processor. To our best knowledge, this is the first birdsong detection algorithm designed to take into account constraints on memory, computational speed, and power usage of embedded devices. Thus, this work points the way to cost-effective IoT technology for at-scale intelligent birdsong data collection and analysis in the field.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Memory management","Wildlife","Sociology","Signal processing","Birds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","biology computing","data analysis","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","Internet of Things","signal classification","zoology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["birdsong detection accuracy","computational complexity","memory demand","Internet-of-Things","real-world IoT devices","birdsong detection algorithm","computational speed","cost-effective IoT technology","at-scale intelligent birdsong data collection","bird species","wildlife biology","animal ecology","climate change","urbanization","temporal limitations","spatial limitations","human observation","bird song","vocalization detection","signal processing","machine learning","ToucaNet","deep neural network","transfer-learning","deep learning","detection accuracy","vocalization classification","BarbNet","STM32 Nucleo H7 board","ARM Cortex-M7 processor","embedded devices","data analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Birdsong Detection","Bird Vocalization","Deep Learning","Internet-of-Things","Embedded Systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00022","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556218/9556219/09556234.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Birdsong Detection at the Edge with Deep Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Birdsong Detection at the Edge with Deep Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556234/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556234/","accessionNumber":"21200964","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Birdsong Detection at the Edge with Deep Learning","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"125200a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113248S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556218","isNumber":"9556219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556218","xplore-issue":"9556219","articleId":"9556234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9556242,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Diamanti","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Diamanti","id":"37088531037"},{"name":"Maria Tsampazi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Tsampazi","id":"37088988931"},{"name":"Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou","affiliation":["University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Eirini Eleni","lastName":"Tsiropoulou","id":"37972918600"},{"name":"Symeon Papavassiliou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Papavassiliou","id":"37268508000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2949-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2693-8340"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2693-8332"}],"articleNumber":"9556242","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Smart cities","Computational modeling","Wireless networks","Games","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","Unmanned aerial vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces","Power Control","Game Theory"]}],"abstract":"To support the provisioning of modern services in a smart city environment, future communication networks need to be intelligently designed with respect to the city infrastructure and energy efficient utilization of resources. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are already being utilized as part of a smart city wireless network infrastructure to provide on-demand connectivity and eliminate the network\u2019s coverage holes, especially when communication conditions are unfavorable. Complementary to this, the adoption of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology allows for the creation of a more controllable smart wireless communications environment. In this article, a multi-user Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communications system aided by a RIS and a UAV is studied. Based on a single-leader multiple-followers Stackelberg Game, we aim to jointly optimize the overall received signal strength at the UAV and maximize the users\u2019 achieved energy efficiency. The UAV \u2013 acting as a leader - intelligently steers the RIS-reflected signals in order to enhance the corresponding received signal quality, by determining the RIS elements\u2019 effective phase shifts. This, in turn, is exploited by the users (i.e., followers), which through the formulation of a non-cooperative game, where each user aims at maximizing its achieved energy efficiency, they determine their optimal uplink transmission power. The proposed optimization framework is evaluated via modeling and simulation, demonstrating the significant power savings and the ultimate users\u2019 satisfaction occurring by the introduction of the RIS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Multi-User Communications Aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces and UAVs","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","doi":"10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00075","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556218/9556219/09556242.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Multi-User Communications Aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces and UAVs","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556242/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013209","fundingName":"Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Multi-User Communications Aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces and UAVs","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"125200a371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062772S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556218","isNumber":"9556219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556218","xplore-issue":"9556219","articleId":"9556242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9556247,"authors":[{"name":"Rishabh Gandhi","affiliation":["California State University San Marcos, San Marcos, California"],"firstName":"Rishabh","lastName":"Gandhi","id":"37088987986"},{"name":"Yanyan Li","affiliation":["California State University San Marcos, San Marcos, California"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Li","id":"37088891715"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2949-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2693-8340"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2693-8332"}],"articleNumber":"9556247","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Performance evaluation","Botnet","Malware","Security","Internet of Things","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","Internet of Things","invasive software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT botnet datasets","detection accuracy","virtual IoT devices","deep learning","machine learning","botnet attack","default user credentials","end users","security awareness","low security settings","Internet of Things devices","IoT botnet detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Security","Botnet","Machine Learning","Random Forest","Deep Learning","Internet of Things","DDoS Attack"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556247","doi":"10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556219","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556218/9556219/09556247.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Machine Learning and Deep Learning for IoT Botnet Detection","abstract":"Botnets have become a major threat to Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to their low security settings out of the box and the lack of security awareness from end users.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named \u2018US-Accidents\u2019 which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors. We have tested ARIS against multiple baselines through a comprehensive series of experiments across several major cities of USA, and we have noticed significant improvement during inference especially in detecting accident classes. Additionally, to make our model edge-implementable we have compressed our model using a joint technique of magnitude-based weight pruning and model quantization. We have also demonstrated the inference results along with power consumption profiling after deploying the model on a resource constrained environment that consists of Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) with Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4). Our investigation and observations indicate major improvements to predict unusual traffic accident event even after model compression and deployment. We have managed to reduce the model size and inference time by \u2248 6x, and \u2248 70 % respectively with insignificant drop in performance. Furthermore, to better understand the importance of each individual type of variables used in our analysis, we have showcased a comprehensive ablation study.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556218/9556219/09556252.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","doi":"10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARIS: A Real Time Edge Computed Accident Risk Inference System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Smart cities","Computational modeling","Predictive models","Real-time systems","Data models","Road safety"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["accident risk prediction","real-time","quantization","pruning","device implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"ARIS: A Real Time Edge Computed Accident Risk Inference System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556252/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARIS: A Real Time Edge Computed Accident Risk Inference System","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"125200a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080429S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556218","isNumber":"9556219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556218","xplore-issue":"9556219","articleId":"9556252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9556261,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Nguyen","affiliation":["The University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Sang","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086802557"},{"name":"Zoran Salcic","affiliation":["The University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Salcic","id":"37264903700"},{"name":"Utsav Trivedi","affiliation":["The University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Utsav","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37088928366"},{"name":"Xuyun Zhang","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Xuyun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088832255"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2949-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2693-8340"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2693-8332"}],"articleNumber":"9556261","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Parking Occupancy by FPGA-Accelerated DNN Models at Fog Layer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556261","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Predictive models","Tools","Hardware","Software","Real-time systems","Libraries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fog computing","Deep Neural Network","FPGA accelerator","parking inferences"]}],"abstract":"Model inference is the final stage in machine/deep learning application deployments in practical applications.

We use the Keras library to build and train software DNN and LSTM models, then compare their prediction performances in terms of accuracy. While the software-implemented inference models indicate advantages of LSTM, we still opted to select only DNN-based models for additional hardware acceleration as the current advanced tool-chains leveraged for automatic software-to-hardware model converting do not allow the creation of LSTM hardware- implemented models.

Given the intricacy, the diagnostics of such systems is extremely important. While anomaly detection is a valid approach to avoid unplanned maintenance or even complete breakdown, its effective realization in IIoT requires the design and implementation of frameworks for efficient monitoring, data collection, and analysis. Most of the existing anomaly detection techniques provide only a diagnosis of the fault without taking into account the uncertainty. Moreover, the lack of ground truth data (which is a typical problem in the industrial context), make their implementation even more challenging. This paper proposes an anomaly detection technique built on top of an industrial framework for the data collection and monitoring. Specifically, we address the lack of labeled data by designing a semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithm that exploits Bayesian Gaussian Mixtures to assess the working condition of the plant while measuring the uncertainty during the diagnosis process and we implement the proposed framework on a real-life IIoT testbed, namely a scale replica assembly plant. Experimental results demonstrate that our anomaly detection algorithm is able to detect the plant working conditions with 99.8% of accuracy, and the semi-supervised approach performs better than a supervised one.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00025","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556218/9556219/09556269.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556219","startPage":"31","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Anomaly Detection Technique for Diagnosing Faults in Industrial IoT Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Anomaly Detection Technique for Diagnosing Faults in Industrial IoT Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556269/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556269/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Anomaly Detection Technique for Diagnosing Faults in Industrial IoT Systems","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"125200a031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049776S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556218","isNumber":"9556219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556218","xplore-issue":"9556219","articleId":"9556269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9556293,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Bharati","affiliation":["Homestead High School, Cupertino, California, USA"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Bharati","id":"37088966256"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2949-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2693-8340"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2693-8332"}],"articleNumber":"9556293","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Pediatrics","Image edge detection","Computational modeling","Death","Turning","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sudden Infant Death Syndrome","SIDS","convolutional neural network","image classification","posture estimation","edge deep learning"]}],"abstract":"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) causes infants under one year of age to die inexplicably. One of the most important external factors, also called an \"outside stressor,\" that is responsible for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), is the sleeping position of the baby. According to past research, the risk of SIDS increases when the baby sleeps facedown on the stomach. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based computer-vision system that estimates the sleeping pose of the baby and alerts caregivers on their mobile phones within a few seconds of the baby moving to the hazardous facedown sleeping position. The system has a low computational load and a low memory footprint. This characteristic allows the system to be embedded in low power edge devices such as certain baby monitors. Processing at the edge also alleviates privacy concerns with regards to sending images into the network. We experimented with various numbers of convolutional processing units and dense layers as well as the number of convolutional kernels to arrive at the optimal production configuration. We observed a consistently high accuracy of detection of infant sleeping position changes from turning to facedown positions with a potential towards even higher accuracies with caregiver feedback for model retraining. Therefore, this system is a viable candidate for consideration as a non-intrusive solution to assist in preventing SIDS.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00061","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556218/9556219/09556293.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Edge Deep Learning Computer Vision System to Prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556293/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Edge Deep Learning Computer Vision System to Prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556293/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Edge Deep Learning Computer Vision System to Prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"125200a286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090462S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556218","isNumber":"9556219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556218","xplore-issue":"9556219","articleId":"9556293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9556309,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey C Kimmell","affiliation":["Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, Tennessee, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey C","lastName":"Kimmell","id":"37088987616"},{"name":"Mahmoud Abdelsalam","affiliation":["Manhattan College, Riverdale, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Abdelsalam","id":"37088220192"},{"name":"Maanak Gupta","affiliation":["Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, Tennessee, USA"],"firstName":"Maanak","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37088218876"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2949-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2693-8340"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2693-8332"}],"articleNumber":"9556309","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Static VAr compensators","Support vector machine classification","Gaussian processes","Malware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Machine Learning","Cloud IaaS","Malware Analysis","Malware Detection"]}],"abstract":"The variety of services and functionality offered by various cloud service providers (CSP) have exploded lately. Utilizing such services has created numerous opportunities for enterprises infrastructure to become cloud-based and, in turn, assisted the enterprises to easily and flexibly offer services to their customers. The practice of renting out access to servers to clients for computing and storage purposes is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The popularity of IaaS has led to serious and critical concerns with respect to the cyber security and privacy. In particular, malware is often leveraged by malicious entities against cloud services to compromise sensitive data or to obstruct their functionality. In response to this growing menace, malware detection for cloud environments has become a widely researched topic with numerous methods being proposed and deployed. In this paper, we present online malware detection based on process level performance metrics, and analyze the effectiveness of different baseline machine learning models including, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosted Classifier (GBC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our analysis conclude that neural network models can most accurately detect the impact malware have on the process level features of virtual machines in the cloud, and therefore are best suited to detect them. Our models were trained, validated, and tested by using a dataset of 40,680 malicious and benign samples. The dataset was complied by running different families of malware (collected from VirusTotal) in a live cloud environment and collecting the process level features.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00046","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556218/9556219/09556309.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing Machine Learning Approaches for Online Malware Detection in Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556309/","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing Machine Learning Approaches for Online Malware Detection in Cloud","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556309/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing Machine Learning Approaches for Online Malware Detection in Cloud","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"125200a189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072543S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556218","isNumber":"9556219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556218","xplore-issue":"9556219","articleId":"9556309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9556310,"authors":[{"name":"Hsuan Su","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Tech, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsuan","lastName":"Su","id":"37088988367"},{"name":"Leehter Yao","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Tech, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Leehter","lastName":"Yao","id":"37088988303"},{"name":"Dennis Hou","affiliation":["Caloudi Corporation, New Brunswick, NJ"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Hou","id":"37088338350"},{"name":"Miles Sun","affiliation":["Caloudi Corporation, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Miles","lastName":"Sun","id":"37088988919"},{"name":"Janpu Hou","affiliation":["Caloudi Corporation, San Fracisco, CA"],"firstName":"Janpu","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086798561"},{"name":"Jeffrey Ying","affiliation":["Caloudi Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Ying","id":"37088921605"},{"name":"Hsin-Yu Feng","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Yu","lastName":"Feng","id":"37088842457"},{"name":"Po-Ying Chen","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Ying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088843572"},{"name":"Raymond Hou","affiliation":["Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Long Island, NY"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Hou","id":"37088988789"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1252-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2949-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2693-8340"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2693-8332"}],"articleNumber":"9556310","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Patient monitoring","Cloud computing","Schedules","Image edge detection","Computational modeling","Time series analysis","Scattering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Remote Patient Monitoring","Intelligent Edge","Cloud Computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556310","abstract":"With machine learning, the remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices are no longer just remote data collection devices. In addition to data analytics, data security and systems integration are also core challenges for developers of the next generation of innovative RPM devices. This includes overcoming technological barriers on applying machine learning algorithms to patient data directly on devices and regulatory barriers on patient data privacy. To address these challenges, this study proposed a unified edge-cloud computing architecture to effectively integrate all the RPM devices in use by the individual patient. All the remote patient monitoring data are managed by edge computing, only the latent representations are uploaded to the cloud for AI-assisted decision making. The proposed model has three modules. The edge medical image module used a subspace learning model for anomalies detection and unhealthy signs and symptoms classification. The edge medical time series module used spectral residual for anomalies detection and scattering wavelet network for severity classification. The cloud telehealth management module used convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and attention model to provide individual patient treatment plan and medicine delivery schedule. The proposed platform has been tested on various RPM devices to provide AI-based anomaly detection and symptoms classifications. The application of the proposed platform has demonstrated that the on-device training model can enable faster and more accurate diagnosis and treatment. For meso-level organizational interoperability on health information exchange, we will only transmit the latent representation instead of the patient\u2019s raw data to reduce cyberattacks and ensure confidentiality of health data.","doi":"10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00049","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556218/9556219/09556310.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing Management Architecture for Digital Health Remote Patient Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing Management Architecture for Digital Health Remote Patient Monitoring","htmlLink":"/document/9556310/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing Management Architecture for Digital Health Remote Patient Monitoring","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"125200a209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060919S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556218","isNumber":"9556219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556218","xplore-issue":"9556219","articleId":"9556310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556318,"authors":[{"name":"Veronia Iskandar","affiliation":["Chair of Adaptive Dynamic Systems, Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Veronia","lastName":"Iskandar","id":"37086638812"},{"name":"Mohamed A.

Modern 3D-stacked DRAM systems can be exploited to prevent unnecessary data movement between the main memory and the CPU. To date, no standardized simulation frameworks or benchmarks are available for the systematic evaluation of NDP systems. Identifying which type of high-performance 3D memory is suitable to use in an NDP system remains a challenge. This is mainly due to the fact that understanding the interactions between modern workloads and the memory subsystem is not a trivial task. Each memory type has its advantages and drawbacks. Additionally, memory access patterns vary greatly across applications. As a result, the performance of a given application on a given memory type is difficult to intuitively predict. There is no specific memory type that can effectively provide high performance for all applications.In this work, we propose a machine learning framework that can efficiently decide which NDP system is suitable for an application. The framework relies on performance prediction based on an input set of application characteristics. For each NDP system we are examining, we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict performance of previously unseen applications on this system. Our models are on average 200x faster than architectural simulation. They can accurately predict performance with coefficients of determination ranging between 0.88 and 0.92, and root mean square errors ranging between 0.08 and 0.19.","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00033","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556318.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Near-Data-Processing Architectures Performance Estimation and Ranking using Machine Learning Predictors","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556318/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Data-Processing Architectures Performance Estimation and Ranking using Machine Learning Predictors","confLoc":"Palermo, Spain","sourcePdf":"270300a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101027S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556322,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Hoang Ngoc Nguyen","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Anh Hoang Ngoc","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37087412228"},{"name":"Yuko Hara-Azumi","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuko","lastName":"Hara-Azumi","id":"38289430100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556322","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded systems","Hardware","Internet of Things","Tuning","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inter-variable dependency","SAT solver","embedded systems"]}],"abstract":"Control rules of Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems are often representable in Satisfiability (SAT) problem.

The core idea is to efficiently model the aging-induced delay degradation at the coarse-grained FPGA basic block level using deep neural networks (DNNs). For each type of the FPGA basic block such as LUT and DSP, we first characterize its accurate delay degradation via transistor-level SPICE simulation under a versatile set of aging factors from the FPGA fabric and in-field operation. Then we train one DNN model for each block type to quickly and accurately predict the complex relation between its delay degradation and comprehensive aging factors.

For large scale systems with multiple inputs and outputs the computational demand of the FxLMS is rising rapidly. Conventional solutions, running on digital signal processors (DSPs), have limitations in parallel computing. In this work a parameterizable multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) feedback FxLMS architecture for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms is presented that can easily be optimized for high-performance or resource efficient computation. The implementation is validated in a real-time practical application using an active headrest with 2x2 channels. The noise reduction is evaluated over various configurations with increasing performance and the respective synthesis results are presented. Here the noise reduction does benefit from the additional computational performance gains. An additional configuration with llxll channels and filter lengths of 2049 at a sample rate of 40 kHz is shown as a benchmark on high-end FPGAs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556342.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"326","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible Multi-Channel Feedback FxLMS Architecture for FPGA Platforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Digital signal processors","Signal processing algorithms","Computer architecture","Filtering algorithms","Software","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ANC","Feedback FxLMS","Multiple Channels","Active Headrest","Hardware Design","VHDL","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Multi-Channel Feedback FxLMS Architecture for FPGA Platforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556342/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Multi-Channel Feedback FxLMS Architecture for FPGA Platforms","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067643S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9556345,"authors":[{"name":"Bita Dabiri","affiliation":["College of Engineering University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Bita","lastName":"Dabiri","id":"37088990657"},{"name":"Mehdi Modarressi","affiliation":["College of Engineering University of Tehran and School of Computor Science, IPM, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Modarressi","id":"37313759900"},{"name":"Masoud Daneshtalab","affiliation":["M\u00e4lardalen University Sweden and Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Daneshtalab","id":"37298922900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2703-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2704-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9556345","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-on-ReRAM for Scalable Processing-in-Memory Architecture Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556345.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"149","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00031","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microarchitecture","Nonvolatile memory","Digital systems","Resistive RAM","Computer architecture","Switches","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ReRAM","Processing-in-memory","Network-on-ReRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556345","abstract":"The non-volatile metal-oxide resistive random access memory (ReRAM) is an emerging alternative for the current memory technologies. The unique capability of ReRAM to perform analog and digital arithmetic and logic operations has enabled this technology to incorporate both computation and memory capabilities on the same unit. Due to this interesting property, there is a growing trend in recent years to implement emerging data-intensive applications on ReRAM structures. A typical ReRAM-based processing-in-memory architecture may consist tens to hundreds of ReRAM units (mats) that can either store or process data. To support such large-scale ReRAM structure, this paper proposes a scalable network-on-ReRAM architecture. The proposed network employs a novel associative router architecture, designed based on the ReRAM-based content-addressable memories. With the in-memory packet processing capability, this router yields higher throughput and resource utilization levels than a conventional router. This router is technology compatible with ReRAM and as our evaluations show, employing it to build a network-on-ReRAM makes the emerging ReRAM-based processing-in-memory architectures more scalable and performance-efficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556345/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network-on-ReRAM for Scalable Processing-in-Memory Architecture Design","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004895","fundingName":"European Social Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-on-ReRAM for Scalable Processing-in-Memory Architecture Design","confLoc":"Palermo, Spain","sourcePdf":"270300a143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051868S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556346,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Wen","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Wen","id":"37088542841"},{"name":"Mian Qin","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Mian","lastName":"Qin","id":"37088350702"},{"name":"Paul Gratz","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Gratz","id":"37540639900"},{"name":"Narasimha Reddy","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Narasimha","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37087227234"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556346","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based Hybrid Memory Emulation System","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556346.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"196","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00039","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Power demand","Three-dimensional displays","Nonvolatile memory","Computational modeling","Memory management","Emulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware emulation","FPGA accelerator","memory system","NVM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556346","abstract":"Hybrid memory systems, comprised of emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) and DRAM, have been proposed to address the growing memory demand of applications. Emerging NVM technologies, such as phase-change memories (PCM), memristor, and 3D XPoint, have higher capacity density, minimal static power consumption and lower cost per GB. However, NVM has longer access latency and limited write endurance as opposed to DRAM. The different characteristics of two memory classes point towards the design of hybrid memory systems containing multiple classes of main memory.In the iterative and incremental development of new architectures, the timeliness of simulation completion is critical to project progression. Hence, a highly efficient simulation method is needed to evaluate the performance of different hybrid memory system designs. Design exploration for hybrid memory systems is challenging, because it requires emulation of the full system stack, including the OS, memory controller, and interconnect. Moreover, benchmark applications for memory performance tests typically have much larger working sets, thus taking an even longer simulation warm-up period.In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based hybrid memory system emulation platform. We target the mobile computing system, which is sensitive to energy consumption and is likely to adopt NVM for its power efficiency. The focus of our platform is on the design of hybrid memory system, so we leverage the on-board hard IP ARM processors to enhance simulation performance while improving the accuracy of results. Thus, users can implement their data placement/migration policies with the FPGA logic elements and evaluate new designs quickly and effectively. Results show that our emulation platform provides a speedup of 9280x in simulation time compared to the software counterpart gem5.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556346/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based Hybrid Memory Emulation System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005708","fundingName":"EMC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based Hybrid Memory Emulation System","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091989S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556350,"authors":[{"name":"Yunhui Qiu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yunhui","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37086864122"},{"name":"Wenbo Yin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Yin","id":"38275070100"},{"name":"Lingli Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lingli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37600175900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556350","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Power demand","Computer architecture","Bandwidth","Programming","Topology","Flash memories"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NAND Flash","Flash controller","FPGA","I/O Scheduling","Parallelism"]}],"abstract":"NAND-Flash-based SSDs have been widely employed in diverse computing domains and storage systems due to their higher performance and lower power consumption than HDDs. There have been various studies to explore the internal parallelism inside SSDs, including the channel-way-plane levels of interleaving and the cache mode pipelining. However, most current studies are based on simulators or focus on part of the parallelism. In this paper, we present an open-source high-performance open-channel open-way NAND Flash controller supporting all the parallelism. Several architecture innovations are proposed to improve performance and resource efficiency. Firstly, the controller exposes the multi-channel, multi-way topology with a queue-based asynchronous interface for each way. Secondly, a dual-level command scheduler is integrated to enable the fine-grained way-level interleaving, plane-level interleaving, and cache mode pipelining. Finally, four finite state machines are designed for the classified Flash command groups. Evaluated on an FPGA platform, the maximum bandwidth can reach 1.2GB/s, accounting for 93% of the theoretical bandwidth, 13% higher than the bandwidth utilization of other Flash controllers. The minimum latencies for the page reading and programming are 119ps and 2ms respectively, which can be further speeded up by 1.9x and 3.1x on average with the multi-level parallelism.","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556350.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"98","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-performance Open-channel Open-way NAND Flash Controller Architecture","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"A High-performance Open-channel Open-way NAND Flash Controller Architecture","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556350/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-performance Open-channel Open-way NAND Flash Controller Architecture","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07561S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556351,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Claesen","affiliation":["KU Leuven & UHasselt, Belgium"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Claesen","id":"37088991969"},{"name":"Arish Sateesan","affiliation":["Imec-COSIC/ES&S, ESAT, KU Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Arish","lastName":"Sateesan","id":"37088525943"},{"name":"Jo Vliegen","affiliation":["Imec-COSIC/ES&S, ESAT, KU Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jo","lastName":"Vliegen","id":"37540417700"},{"name":"Nele Mentens","affiliation":["Imec-COSIC/ES&S, ESAT, KU Leuven, Belgium","LIACS, Leiden University, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Nele","lastName":"Mentens","id":"37272474100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2703-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2704-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9556351","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Non-cryptographic Hash Functions for Networking and Security Applications on FPGA","abstract":"This paper proposes the design and FPGA implementation of five novel non-cryptographic hash functions, that are suitable to be used in networking and security applications that require fast lookup and/or counting architectures.

We simulate how many rounds are needed to achieve satisfactory avalanche scores and we implement the corresponding non-cryptographic hash functions on an FPGA to evaluate the occupied resources and the performance.

Experiments based on popular datasets for continual learning, CoRE50 and CUB200, demonstrate that the proposed SLDA accelerator outperforms the embedded CPU and GPU counterparts, in terms of speed and energy efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556356/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Continual Learning on Edge FPGA","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Continual Learning on Edge FPGA","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09017S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556357,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico Calore","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi di Ferrara and INFN Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Calore","id":"37085490213"},{"name":"Sebastiano Fabio Schifano","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi di Ferrara and INFN Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Sebastiano Fabio","lastName":"Schifano","id":"38313029600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556357","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Computational modeling","Bandwidth","Tools","Benchmark testing","Throughput","High level synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Roofline","HPC","Accelerator","performance","benchmark","floating point"]}],"abstract":"Hardware accelerators are nowadays very common in HPC systems, and GPUs are playing a major role in this. More recently, also FPGAs started to be adopted in few data centers to accelerate specific workloads, and it is expected that in the near future they will be increasingly used also in general purpose HPC systems. FPGAs are already known to provide interesting speedups in several application fields, but to estimate their expected performance in the context of typical HPC workloads is not straightforward. To ease this task, in this paper we present the FPGA Empirical Roofline (FER), a benchmarking tool able to empirically estimate the computing throughput and memory bandwidth of FPGAs, when used as hardware accelerators for HPC applications. Using the widely known Roofline Model as a theoretical foundation, FER allows to measure FPGAs computing throughput and bandwidth upper-bounds, allowing to estimate the performance of function kernels developed using high level synthesis tools, according to their arithmetic intensity. We implemented FER using two different high level paradigms: OmpSs@FPGA and Xilinx Vitis workflow, two promising approaches to develop HPC applications enabling exploitation of FPGAs as hardware accelerators. In this paper we describe the theoretical model on which the FER benchmark relies, as well as its implementation details, and we provide performance results measured on the Xilinx Alveo U250 FPGA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance assessment of FPGAs as HPC accelerators using the FPGA Empirical Roofline","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00022","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556357.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment of FPGAs as HPC accelerators using the FPGA Empirical Roofline","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556357/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment of FPGAs as HPC accelerators using the FPGA Empirical Roofline","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077811S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556360,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Langhammer","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, UK"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Langhammer","id":"37348413000"},{"name":"Simon Finn","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Finn","id":"37086157969"},{"name":"Sergey Gribok","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, US"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Gribok","id":"37086857953"},{"name":"Bogdan Pasca","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, France"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Pasca","id":"37545456300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556360","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dense FPGA Compute Using Signed Byte Tuples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556360","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Training","Industries","Tensors","Fitting","Routing","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["signed byte tuples","multiplication","tensor","dot-product","Stratix 10 NX","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"The importance of AI to FPGA has resulted in ever increasing low precision hard arithmetic features in newer devices. Many FPGAs, including those from Achronix, Intel, and Xilinx, have significantly increased the density of INT8 and INT9 embedded multipliers. Mainstream devices with these enhanced densities still support the traditional intermediate integer (typically 18-bit) multipliers, with IEEE-754 floating-point now becoming more prevalent as well.Recently, Intel introduced the Stratix 10 NX FPGA, which is targeted specifically at AI acceleration. This device contains a new type of AI-specific DSP Block with approximately an order of magnitude higher INT8 density than previous FPGA industry DSP Blocks. Larger standard FPGA integer precisions, however, are not directly supported. Intel has described some methods of aggregating larger multipliers from the NX Blocks, but these are somewhat smaller than typically used by DSP applications. Larger multiplications can also be useful for other AI applications, such as found in training. In this paper, we introduce the concept of signed tuples, which can be used to assemble signed multipliers into more useful larger precision multipliers by leveraging FPGA soft-logic inexpensively. We demonstrate several constructions of INT16 multipliers, with some modes requiring less than 3 ALMs per INT16 multiplier when implemented in a tensor format. We also describe the application of these methods to even larger multipliers and alternate constructs such as complex multiplication. We show that there is essentially no performance degradation or system fitting impact from our method. The mid-size NX device can support up 33 TOPs INT16 (from 29,700 constructed INT16 multipliers on a mid-speed grade device) with this approach, which is higher than any other current or announced monolithic die FPGA. Our methods are not limited to FPGA, or any particular starting precision, and so may be used for other aggregations as well.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00029","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556360.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"Dense FPGA Compute Using Signed Byte Tuples","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556360/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dense FPGA Compute Using Signed Byte Tuples","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056644S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556365,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Montgomerie-Corcoran","affiliation":["Imperial College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Montgomerie-Corcoran","id":"37087413993"},{"name":"Christos-Savvas Bouganis","affiliation":["Imperial College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos-Savvas","lastName":"Bouganis","id":"37299183200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2703-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2704-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9556365","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Power demand","Digital systems","Memory management","Tools","Benchmark testing","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Networks","Power Modelling","Machine Learning Acceleration"]}],"abstract":"Reducing the power and energy consumption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Accelerators is becoming an increasingly popular design objective for both cloud and edge-based settings. Aiming towards the design of more efficient accelerator systems, the accelerator architect must understand how different design choices impact both power and energy consumption. The purpose of this work is to enable CNN accelerator designers to explore how design choices affect the memory subsystem in particular, which is a significant contributing component. By considering high-level design parameters of CNN accelerators that affect the memory subsystem, the proposed tool returns power and energy consumption estimates for a range of networks and memory types. This allows for power and energy of the off-chip memory subsystem to be considered earlier within the design process, enabling greater optimisations at the beginning phases. Towards this, the paper introduces POMMEL, an off-chip memory subsystem modelling tool for CNN accelerators, and its evaluation across a range of accelerators, networks, and memory types is performed. Furthermore, using POMMEL, the impact of various state-of-the-art compression and activity reduction schemes on the power and energy consumption of current accelerations is also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00073","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556365.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"POMMEL: Exploring Off-Chip Memory Energy & Power Consumption in Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556365/","displayDocTitle":"POMMEL: Exploring Off-Chip Memory Energy & Power Consumption in Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556365/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"POMMEL: Exploring Off-Chip Memory Energy & Power Consumption in Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators","confLoc":"Palermo, Spain","sourcePdf":"270300a442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085858S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556367,"authors":[{"name":"Sathish Panchapakesan","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"firstName":"Sathish","lastName":"Panchapakesan","id":"37088419891"},{"name":"Zhenman Fang","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhenman","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085672682"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Futurewei Technologies, Inc, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37088993667"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556367","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Neurons","Memory management","Hardware","Encoding","Computational efficiency","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spiking Neural Networks","Hardware Acceleration","High Level Synthesis","Image Classification"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel synchronous approach for rate encoding based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which is more hardware friendly than conventional asynchronous approaches.

In this optimization process, benchmark circuits are an essential component; the QoR achieved on a set of benchmarks is the main driver for architecture and CAD design choices. However, current academic benchmark suites are inadequate, as they do not capture any designs from the DL domain. This work presents a new suite of DL acceleration benchmark circuits for FPGA architecture and CAD research, called Koios. This suite of 19 circuits covers a wide variety of accelerated neural networks, design sizes, implementation styles, abstraction levels, and numerical precisions. These designs are larger, more data parallel, more heterogeneous, more deeply pipelined, and utilize more FPGA architectural features compared to existing open-source benchmarks. This enables researchers to pin-point architectural inefficiencies for this class of workloads and optimize CAD tools on more realistic benchmarks that stress the CAD algorithms in different ways. In this paper, we describe the designs in our benchmark suite, present results of running them through the Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) flow using a recent FPGA architecture model, and identify key insights from the resulting metrics. On average, our benchmarks have 3.7\u00d7 more netlist primitives, 1.8\u00d7 and 4.7\u00d7 higher DSP and BRAM densities, and 1.7\u00d7 higher frequency with 1.9\u00d7 more near-critical paths compared to the widely-used VTR suite.

We present an overview of our toolkit with its three main components: 1) fault-tolerant structures insertion (which we call helpers); 2) fault-tolerant structures selection (called guiders); and 3) automatic testbed generation, incorporating advanced acceleration techniques to accelerate the test and evaluation. Our approach is targeting complete independence on the HW description language and its abstraction level, however, for our case study, we focus on VHDL in combination with fine-grained n-modular redundancy. In the case study part of this paper, we proved that it is undoubtedly beneficial to select a proper fault tolerance method for each partition separately. Three experimental systems were developed with the usage of our method. Two of them achieved better reliability parameter while even lowering their chip area, compared to static allocation of equivalent fault tolerance technique type. In the case study, we target the best median time to failure, the so-called t50, however, our method is not dependent on this parameter and arbitrary optimization target can be selected, as soon as it is measurable.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556374.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"552","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Design of Fault-Tolerant Systems for VHDL and SRAM-based FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device measurement","VHDL","Fault tolerant systems","Redundancy","Life estimation","Reliability engineering","Time measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault-Tolerant System Design","Electronic Design Automation","Redundancy Insertion","Redundancy Allocation","Multiple-choice Knapsack Problem","FPGA","VHDL","t50"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Design of Fault-Tolerant Systems for VHDL and SRAM-based FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556374/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Design of Fault-Tolerant Systems for VHDL and SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Palermo, Spain","sourcePdf":"270300a549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078179S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9556384,"authors":[{"name":"Daouda Diakite","affiliation":["CNRS, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, L2S, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Daouda","lastName":"Diakite","id":"37088992567"},{"name":"Nicolas Gac","affiliation":["CNRS, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, L2S, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Gac","id":"37296317500"},{"name":"Maxime Martelli","affiliation":["Information Services Group, Inc."],"firstName":"Maxime","lastName":"Martelli","id":"37086234071"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556384","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpenCL FPGA Optimization guided by memory accesses and roofline model analysis applied to tomography acceleration","abstract":"Backward projection is one of the most time-consuming steps in method-based iterative reconstruction computed tomography.

This design flow is based initially on an offline memory access analysis, then iteratively on a performance analysis of each new implementation represented on a Berkeley Roofline model.By taking advantage of the FPGAs local memory architecture, we have succeeded to design an efficient pipeline reaching maximum bandwidth with stall-free access underlining this platform\u2019s interest for memory optimization. Our design flow allowed for a significant improvement of our initial algorithm\u2019s computational intensity, resulting in better performance on FPGA.

In this paper, a parameterizable Vector Processing Unit (VPU) is presented based on a subset of V-extension from the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) for embedded processing. Two key configurable parameters for the proposed VPU are vector length (VLEN) and the number of execution lanes. These parameters allow design space exploration for the VPU for different configurations and help to understand which application scenarios would fit for certain configurations. The proposed VPU was integrated into a 32-bit RISC-V processor. For maximum parallelization configuration, 2.3 x fewer cycles per instructions were achieved as compared to a RISC-V processor. Moreover, a relative cycle gain of 33-73% was achieved for different configurations as compared with the RISC-V processor.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556410.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector Processing Unit: A RISC-V based SIMD Co-processor for Embedded Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital systems","Instruction sets","Graphics processing units","Computer architecture","Logic gates","Market research","Space exploration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SIMD","Co-processor","Vector processing","RISC-V","System-on-Chip (SoC)","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Vector Processing Unit: A RISC-V based SIMD Co-processor for Embedded Processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556410/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009950","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector Processing Unit: A RISC-V based SIMD Co-processor for Embedded Processing","confLoc":"Palermo, Italy","sourcePdf":"270300a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037471S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":9556413,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Yan","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Yan","id":"37087091524"},{"name":"Zhengyan Liu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University"],"firstName":"Zhengyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088993298"},{"name":"Yun Wang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088993821"},{"name":"Chenglong Zeng","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University"],"firstName":"Chenglong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086865085"},{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37290889900"},{"name":"Bowen Cheng","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Spacecraft System Engineering"],"firstName":"Bowen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37088990080"},{"name":"Ray C.C.

However, the computation and resource intensive characteristics of CNN bring obstacles to its application on embedded systems. MobileNet, as a representative of compact models, can reduce the amount of parameters and computation. A high-performance inference accelerator on FPGA for MobileNet is proposed in this paper. With respect to the three types of convolution operations, multiple parallel strategies are exploited and the corresponding hardware structures such as input buffer and configurable adder tree are designed. With respect to the bottleneck block, a dedicated architecture is proposed to reduce data transmission time. In addition, a hardware padding scheme to improve the efficiency of padding is proposed. The accelerator implemented on Virtex-7 FPGA reaches 70.8% Top-1 accuracy under 8-bit quantization. The accelerator achieves 302.3 FPS and 181.8 GOPS, which obtains 22.7x, 3.9x and 1.4x speedup compared to the implementations in Snapdragon 821 CPU, i7-6700HQ CPU and GTX 960M GPU, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00011","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556413.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based MobileNet Accelerator Considering Network Structure Characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556413/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based MobileNet Accelerator Considering Network Structure Characteristics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556413/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based MobileNet Accelerator Considering Network Structure Characteristics","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067214S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556416,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Cilardo","affiliation":["University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Cilardo","id":"37300501900"},{"name":"Stefano Mercogliano","affiliation":["University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Mercogliano","id":"37088991951"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2703-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2704-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9556416","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"This technical contribution deals with monitoring support for CAN, a popular protocol in automotive and robotics applications with various levels of criticality, therefore requiring strict reliability and performance guarantees.

Design space exploration of caches enables the architect to choose the right configuration based on metrics such as hit rates, power, area, and timing. Although the idea of a cache simulator is not new, the hardware/FPGA implementation of such simulators has not been well explored. We implement an FPGA accelerated parameterized two-level cache simulator called Cache-accel which can be partially reconfigured to include prefetching. The key motivation behind the idea is the speed with which the design space exploration can be carried out by exploiting the parallelism available in an FPGA. Cache-accel reports cache metrics such as hit/miss rates with and without prefetching for nine cache configurations in parallel. We run a set of SPEC 2017 benchmarks on Cache-accel and find that it can run nearly 7x and 11.5x faster (on an average) as compared to ChampSim and Snipersim to generate hit/miss rates for the nine parallel configurations.","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00024","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","startPage":"97","endPage":"100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache-accel: FPGA Accelerated Cache Simulator with Partially Reconfigurable Prefetcher","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cache-accel: FPGA Accelerated Cache Simulator with Partially Reconfigurable Prefetcher","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556421/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556421/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache-accel: FPGA Accelerated Cache Simulator with Partially Reconfigurable Prefetcher","confLoc":"Palermo, Spain","sourcePdf":"270300a097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075997S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9556422,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Meng","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Meng","id":"37088849578"},{"name":"Shreyas Kolala Venkataramanaiah","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shreyas Kolala","lastName":"Venkataramanaiah","id":"37086361421"},{"name":"Chuteng Zhou","affiliation":["Arm ML Research, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Chuteng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37088990309"},{"name":"Patrick Hansen","affiliation":["Arm ML Research, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Hansen","id":"37086229890"},{"name":"Paul Whatmough","affiliation":["Arm ML Research, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Whatmough","id":"37543130500"},{"name":"Jae-sun Seo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jae-sun","lastName":"Seo","id":"37085457143"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556422","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Memory management","Object detection","Streaming media","Software","Real-time systems","System-on-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolution neural networks","hardware accelerator","FPGA","low-precision quantization","pruning."]}],"abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become very popular in real-time computer vision systems. CNNs involve a large amount of computation and storage and typically demand a highly efficient computing platform. Researchers have explored a diverse range of software and hardware optimizations to accelerate CNN inference in recent years. The high power consumption of GPUs and the lack of flexibility with ASIC has promoted interest in FPGAs as a promising platform to efficiently accelerate these CNN inference tasks. Various FPGA-based CNN accelerators have been proposed to low precision weights and high-sparsity in various forms. However, most of the previous work requires off-chip DDR memory to store the parameters and expensive DSP blocks to perform the computation. In this work, we propose the FixyFPGA, a fully on-chip CNN inference accelerator that naturally supports high-sparsity and low-precision computation. In our design, the weights of the trained CNN network are hard-coded into hardware and used as fixed operand for the multiplication. Convolution is performed by streaming the input images to the compute engine in a fully-paralleled, fully-pipelined manner. We analyzed the performance of the proposed scheme with both image classification tasks and object detection tasks based on the low precision, sparse compact CNN models. Compared to prior works, our design achieved 2.34\u00d7 higher GOPS on ImageNet classification and 3.82\u00d7 higher frames per second on Pascal VOC object detection.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00010","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556422.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FixyFPGA: Efficient FPGA Accelerator for Deep Neural Networks with High Element-Wise Sparsity and without External Memory Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556422/","displayDocTitle":"FixyFPGA: Efficient FPGA Accelerator for Deep Neural Networks with High Element-Wise Sparsity and without External Memory Access","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556422/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FixyFPGA: Efficient FPGA Accelerator for Deep Neural Networks with High Element-Wise Sparsity and without External Memory Access","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10487S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556423,"authors":[{"name":"Franz-Josef Streit","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Franz-Josef","lastName":"Streit","id":"37086639016"},{"name":"Paul Kr\u00fcger","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Kr\u00fcger","id":"37088992399"},{"name":"Andreas Becher","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Becher","id":"37085431511"},{"name":"Jens Schlumberger","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Schlumberger","id":"37086199093"},{"name":"Stefan Wildermann","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wildermann","id":"37669339300"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Teich","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556423","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manufacturing processes","Bit error rate","Physical unclonable function","Turning","Shift registers","Rendering (computer graphics)","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PUF","Security","FPGA","Hardware/Software Co-Design"]}],"abstract":"FPGA-based Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have emerged as a viable alternative to permanent key storage by turning inaccuracies during the manufacturing process of a chip into a unique, FPGA-intrinsic secret. However, many fixed PUF designs may suffer from unsatisfactory statistical properties in terms of uniqueness, uniformity, and robustness. Moreover, a PUF signature may alter over time due to aging or changing operating conditions, rendering a PUF insecure in the worst case. As a remedy, we propose CHOICE, a novel class of FPGA-based PUF designs with tunable uniqueness and reliability characteristics. By the use of addressable shift registers available on an FPGA, we show that a wide configuration space for adjusting a device-specific PUF response is obtained without any sacrifice of randomness. In particular, we demonstrate the concept of address-tunable propagation delays, whereby we are able to increase or decrease the probability of obtaining 1\u2019s in the PUF response. Experimental evaluations on a group of six 28 nm Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs show that CHOICE PUFs provide a large range of configurations to allow a fine-tuning to an average uniqueness between 49% and 51%, while simultaneously achieving bit error rates below 1.5%, thus outperforming state-of-the-art PUF designs. Moreover, with only a single FPGA slice per PUF bit, CHOICE is one of the smallest PUF designs currently available for FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00015","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","startPage":"38","endPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Choice \u2013 A Tunable PUF-Design for FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Choice \u2013 A Tunable PUF-Design for FPGAs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556423/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choice \u2013 A Tunable PUF-Design for FPGAs","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061965S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9556424,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yu","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088989960"},{"name":"Andrew Attwood","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, UK","Liverpool John Moores University, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Attwood","id":"38235159500"},{"name":"Nguyen Dao","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":"Dao","id":"37088856380"},{"name":"Dirk Koch","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Koch","id":"38268904500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556424","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Ecosystems","Tools","Fabrics","Systems support","Hardware design languages","Open source software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["eFPGAs","embedded FPGAs","ASIC design","open source hardware"]}],"abstract":"This demonstration shows the steps a designer has to take to specify and implement a chip with an embedded FPGA (eFPGA) using the FABulous open-source toolchain.

The system supports multiple partially reconfigurable regions for hosting reconfigurable instruction set extensions, and the fabric provides logic, DSP, and memory slices.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00090","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556424.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The FABulous Open eFPGA Ecosystem in Action - From Specifications to Chips to Running Bitsteams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556424/","displayDocTitle":"The FABulous Open eFPGA Ecosystem in Action - From Specifications to Chips to Running Bitsteams","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556424/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The FABulous Open eFPGA Ecosystem in Action - From Specifications to Chips to Running Bitsteams","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031694S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556430,"authors":[{"name":"Emilien Fournier","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, ENSTA Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Emilien","lastName":"Fournier","id":"37088525434"},{"name":"Ciprian Teodorov","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, ENSTA Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Ciprian","lastName":"Teodorov","id":"37714071400"},{"name":"Lo\u00efc Lagadec","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, ENSTA Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Lo\u00efc","lastName":"Lagadec","id":"37572441400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556430","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scalability","Software algorithms","Computer architecture","Benchmark testing","Software","Field programmable gate arrays","Engines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model-checking","Swarm Verification","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"The mapping of software verification algorithms on FPGA promise orders of magnitude faster verification.

However, developing a distributed FPGA application remains difficult for two reasons. First, commonly available development frameworks (e.g., Xilinx Vitis) lack explicit support for networking. Developers are, thus, forced to build their own infrastructure to handle the data movement between the host, the FPGA, and the network. Second, distributed applications are made even more complex by using low level interfaces to access the network and process packets. Ideally, one needs to combine high performance with a simple interface for both point-to-point and collective operations. To overcome these inefficiencies and enable further research in networking and distributed application on FPGAs, we first show how to integrate an open-source 100 Gbps TCP/IP stack into a state-of-the-art FPGA development framework (Xilinx Vitis) without degrading its performance. Further, we provide a set of MPI-like communication primitives for both point-to-point and collective operations as a High Level Synthesis (HLS) library. Our point-to-point primitives saturate a 100 Gbps link and our collective primitives achieve low latency. With our approach, developers can write hardware kernels in high level languages with the network abstracted away behind standard interfaces. To evaluate the ease of use and performance in a real application, we distribute a K-Means algorithm with the new stack and achieve a 1.9X and 3.5X throughput increase with 2 FPGAs and 4 FPGAs respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556439.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EasyNet: 100 Gbps Network for HLS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TCPIP","Tools","Throughput","Libraries","High level synthesis","Low latency communication","Kernel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"EasyNet: 100 Gbps Network for HLS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556439/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EasyNet: 100 Gbps Network for HLS","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091489S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9556440,"authors":[{"name":"Arne Kreddig","affiliation":["SmartRay GmbH, Wolfratshausen, Germany"],"firstName":"Arne","lastName":"Kreddig","id":"37088561248"},{"name":"Simon Conrady","affiliation":["Arnold & Richter Cine Technik, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Conrady","id":"37088562698"},{"name":"Manu Manuel","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Systems, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Manu","lastName":"Manuel","id":"37088561470"},{"name":"Walter Stechele","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Systems, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Stechele","id":"37295611800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2703-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2704-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9556440","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Image color analysis","Approximate computing","Estimation","Training data","Propagation losses","Space exploration"]}],"abstract":"The demands for both increased performance and low power consumption on computing devices are outpacing technological improvements. Approximate computing is a design paradigm to leverage inherent error resilience of applications and trades in quality to reduce resource usage. Numerous approaches for approximation on FPGAs have been proposed in recent years and combining different methods can increase the resulting benefits in complex systems. Interactions between system components and error propagation necessitate a global design space exploration for the optimization of the approximation parameters. The loss of quality can be assessed by employing application-specific reference error metrics like PSNR or CIELAB \u0394E which are well understood by designers and take error propagation implicitly into account. However, using a reference error metric can be very time-consuming, slowing down the design space exploration. To overcome this problem, we propose a framework for fast design space exploration of approximated FPGA designs in which the quality estimation is offloaded to an FPGA-based accelerator while the rest of the design space exploration is handled by a workstation PC. We evaluate the proposed framework on an image processing pipeline which is used to adapt image colors to be displayed correctly on a monitor. Our experiments show that using the accelerator yields similar results for the design in terms of the achieved quality-power trade-off compared to a software-only setup and can speed up the exploration by a factor of over 200x.","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556440.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Hardware-Accelerated Design Space Exploration for Approximate Computing on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Hardware-Accelerated Design Space Exploration for Approximate Computing on FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556440/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004725","fundingName":"Ministry of Economic Affairs"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Hardware-Accelerated Design Space Exploration for Approximate Computing on FPGA","confLoc":"Palermo, Spain","sourcePdf":"270300a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076314S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556441,"authors":[{"name":"Lu\u00edza C.

As a result, an increase in popularity of SNNs is expected in the near future for cyber physical systems, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) segment. However, SNNs work very different than conventional neural network architectures. Consequently, applying SNNs in the field might introduce new unexpected security vulnerabilities. This paper explores and identifies potential sources of information leakage for the Izhikevich neuron, which is a popular neuron model used in digital implementations of SNNs. Simulations and experiments on FPGA implementation of the spiking neurons show that timing and power can be used to infer important information of the internal functionality of the network.

Compared to the reference WFA CPU-only implementation, the proposed FPGA accelerator achieves performance speedups of up to 13.5 \u00d7 while consuming up to 14.6 \u00d7 less energy.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00033","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556445.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA Accelerator of the Wavefront Algorithm for Genomics Pairwise Alignment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556445/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA Accelerator of the Wavefront Algorithm for Genomics Pairwise Alignment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556445/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100017693","fundingName":"HiPEAC Network"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002809","fundingName":"Generalitat de Catalunya"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007170","fundingName":"Ministry of Economy"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007170","fundingName":"Ministry of Economy"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA Accelerator of the Wavefront Algorithm for Genomics Pairwise Alignment","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149298S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556446,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuho Hashimoto","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo"],"firstName":"Nobuho","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37088992191"},{"name":"Shinya Takamaeda-Yamazaki","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo"],"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Takamaeda-Yamazaki","id":"37085414310"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556446","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Sensitivity","Three-dimensional displays","Noise reduction","Bandwidth","Hardware","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Processing","Denoising Filter","Bilateral Filter","Bilateral Grid."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556446","abstract":"The bilateral filter (BF) is widely used in image processing because it can perform denoising while preserving edges. It has disadvantages in that it is nonlinear, and its computational complexity and hardware resources are directly proportional to its window size. Thus far, several approximation methods and hardware implementations have been proposed to solve these problems. However, processing large-scale and high-resolution images in real time under severe hardware resource constraints remains a challenge. This paper proposes a real-time image denoising system that uses an FPGA based on the bilateral grid (BG). In the BG, a 2D image consisting of x- and y-axes is projected onto a 3D space called a \u201cgrid,\u201d which consists of axes that correlate to the x-component, y-component, and intensity value of the input image. This grid is then blurred using the Gaussian filter, and the output image is generated by interpolating the grid. Although it is possible to change the window size in the BF, it is impossible to change it on the input image in the BG. This makes it difficult to associate the BG with the BF and to obtain the property of suppressing the increase in hardware resources when the window radius is enlarged. This study demonstrates that a BG with a variable-sized window can be realized by introducing the window radius parameter wherein the window radius on the grid is always 1. We then implement this BG on an FPGA in a fully pipelined manner. Further, we verify that our design suppresses the increase in hardware resources even when the window size is enlarged and outperforms the existing designs in terms of computation speed and hardware resources.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00035","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556446.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Based Fully Pipelined Bilateral Grid for Real-Time Image Denoising","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based Fully Pipelined Bilateral Grid for Real-Time Image Denoising","htmlLink":"/document/9556446/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Based Fully Pipelined Bilateral Grid for Real-Time Image Denoising","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091856S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556449,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Corda","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology","Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Corda","id":"37086499977"},{"name":"Madhurya Kumaraswamy","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Madhurya","lastName":"Kumaraswamy","id":"37088992385"},{"name":"Ahsan Javed Awan","affiliation":["Ericsson Research"],"firstName":"Ahsan Javed","lastName":"Awan","id":"37087046087"},{"name":"Roel Jordans","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Roel","lastName":"Jordans","id":"38542604000"},{"name":"Akash Kumar","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"],"firstName":"Akash","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37292250700"},{"name":"Henk Corporaal","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Corporaal","id":"37266918700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2703-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2704-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9556449","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital systems","Computational modeling","Estimation","Predictive models","Tools","Kernel","Tuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["near memory computing","acceleration","machine learning","performance prediction","radio astronomy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556449","abstract":"Real-world applications are now processing big-data sets, often bottlenecked by the data movement between the compute units and the main memory.

The lack of NMC system availability makes simulators the primary evaluation tool for performance estimation. However, simulators are usually time-consuming, and methods that can reduce this overhead would accelerate the early-stage design process of NMC systems. This work proposes Near-Memory computing Profiling and Offloading (NMPO), a high-level framework capable of predicting NMC offloading suitability employing an ensemble machine learning model. NMPO predicts NMC suitability with an accuracy of 85.6% and, compared to prior works, can reduce the prediction time by using hardware-dependent applications features by up to 3 order of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00048","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556449.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NMPO: Near-Memory Computing Profiling and Offloading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"NMPO: Near-Memory Computing Profiling and Offloading","htmlLink":"/document/9556449/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NMPO: Near-Memory Computing Profiling and Offloading","confLoc":"Palermo, Spain","sourcePdf":"270300a259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107836S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556450,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil P Ghanathe","affiliation":["University of British Columbia"],"firstName":"Nikhil P","lastName":"Ghanathe","id":"37088992591"},{"name":"Vivek Seshadri","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Seshadri","id":"37088989995"},{"name":"Rahul Sharma","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086947225"},{"name":"Steve Wilton","affiliation":["University of British Columbia"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Wilton","id":"37265862300"},{"name":"Aayan Kumar","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Aayan","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37088992348"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556450","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Program processors","Machine learning algorithms","Neural networks","Machine learning","Linear algebra","Tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning Inference, FPGA, High level synthesis, Compiler, Hardware Acceleration, Internet of Things, Resource constrained devices"]}],"abstract":"Recent breakthroughs in ML have produced new classes of models that allow ML inference to run directly on milliwatt-powered IoT devices.

To remove the memory bottleneck, we take advantage of the High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) available on the latest FPGAs for highly concurrent embedding table lookups. To match the required DNN computation throughput, we partition the workload across multiple FPGAs interconnected via a 100 Gbps TCP/IP network.

The proposed system also guarantees a latency of tens of microseconds per single inference, significantly better than CPU and GPU-based systems which take at least milliseconds.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00057","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556456.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Recommendation Inference on FPGA Clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556456/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Recommendation Inference on FPGA Clusters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556456/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Recommendation Inference on FPGA Clusters","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06347S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9556458,"authors":[{"name":"Cornelia Wulf","affiliation":["Adaptive Dynamic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Cornelia","lastName":"Wulf","id":"37088560795"},{"name":"Michael Willig","affiliation":["Adaptive Dynamic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Willig","id":"37088560931"},{"name":"Diana G\u00f6hringer","affiliation":["Adaptive Dynamic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"G\u00f6hringer","id":"37393007400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556458","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"The increase of size, capabilities, and speed of FPGAs enables the shared usage of reconfigurable resources by multiple applications and even operating systems. While research on FPGA virtualization in HPC-datacenters and cloud is already well advanced, it is a rather new concept for embedded systems. The necessity for FPGA virtualization of embedded systems results from the trend to integrate multiple environments into the same hardware platform. As multiple guest operating systems with different requirements, e.g., regarding real-time, security, safety, or reliability share the same resources, the focus of research lies on isolation under the constraint of having minimal impact on the overall system. Drivers for this development are, e.g., computation intensive AI-based applications in the automotive or medical field, embedded 5G edge computing systems, or the consolidation of electronic control units (ECUs) on a centralized MPSoC with the goal to increase reliability by reducing complexity. This survey outlines key concepts of hypervisor-based virtualization of embedded reconfigurable systems. Hypervisor approaches are compared and classified into FPGA-based hypervisors, MPSoC-based hypervisors and hypervisors for distributed embedded reconfigurable systems. Strong points and limitations are pointed out and future trends for virtualization of embedded reconfigurable systems are identified.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556458.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"256","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Hypervisor-based Virtualization of Embedded Reconfigurable Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machine monitors","Embedded systems","Market research","Hardware","Real-time systems","Safety","Reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hypervisor","FPGA Virtualization","Virtual Machine","Embedded","Real-Time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Hypervisor-based Virtualization of Embedded Reconfigurable Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556458/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Hypervisor-based Virtualization of Embedded Reconfigurable Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139809S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9556462,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Irmak","affiliation":["University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Irmak","id":"37062017400"},{"name":"Daniel Ziener","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Ziener","id":"37300389000"},{"name":"Nikolaos Alachiotis","affiliation":["University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Alachiotis","id":"37393238000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556462","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Degradation","Computational modeling","Accelerator architectures","Switches","Throughput","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","CNN","Partial Reconfiguration"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used for image classification and have achieved significantly accurate performance in the last decade. However, they require computationally intensive operations for embedded applications. In recent years, FPGA-based CNN accelerators have been proposed to improve energy efficiency and throughput. While dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) is increasingly used in CNN accelerators, the performance of dynamically reconfigurable accelerators is usually lower than the performance of pure static FPGA designs. This work presents a dynamically reconfigurable CNN accelerator architecture that does not sacrifice throughput performance or classification accuracy. The proposed accelerator is composed of reconfigurable macroblocks and dynamically utilizes the device resources according to model parameters. Moreover, we devise a novel approach, to the best of our knowledge, to hide the computations of the pooling layers inside the convolutional layers, thereby further improving throughput. Using the proposed architecture and DPR, different CNN architectures can be realized on the same FPGA with optimized throughput and accuracy. The proposed architecture is evaluated by implementing two different LeNet CNN models trained by different datasets and classifying different classes. Experimental results show that the implemented design achieves higher throughput than current LeNet FPGA accelerators.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00061","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556462.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing Flexibility of FPGA-based CNN Accelerators with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556462/","displayDocTitle":"Increasing Flexibility of FPGA-based CNN Accelerators with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556462/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing Flexibility of FPGA-based CNN Accelerators with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069445S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556467,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086881351"},{"name":"Jinming Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jinming","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37088991498"},{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37535218300"},{"name":"Lei He","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"He","id":"37269852200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556467","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Processor scheduling","Bandwidth","Computer architecture","Throughput","Hardware","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mixed precision","CNN","FPGA","Hardware Acceleration"]}],"abstract":"Low precision quantization in convolutional neural network (CNN) inference has been proved effective for reducing computation complexity and bandwidth requirement.

Single-shot detectors (SSD) coupled with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction can efficiently detect, classify and localize various objects in an input image with very high accuracy. In such systems, the convolution layers extract features and predict the bounding box locations for the detected objects as well as their confidence scores. Then, a non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm eliminates partially overlapping boxes and selects the bounding box with the highest score per class. However, these two components are strictly sequential; a conventional NMS algorithm needs to wait for all box predictions to be produced before processing them. This prohibits any overlap between the execution of the convolutional layers and NMS, resulting in significant latency overhead and throughput degradation. In this paper, we present a novel NMS algorithm that alleviates this bottleneck and enables a fully-pipelined hardware implementation. We also implement an end-to-end system for low-latency SSD-MobileNet-V1 object detection, which combines a state-of-the-art deeply-pipelined CNN accelerator with a custom hardware implementation of our novel NMS algorithm. As a result of our new algorithm, the NMS module adds a minimal latency overhead of only 0.13\u03bc s to the SSD-MobileNet-V1 convolution layers. Our end-to-end object detection system implemented on an Intel Stratix 10 FPGA runs at a maximum operating frequency of 350 MHz, with a throughput of 609 frames-per-second and an end-to-end batch-1 latency of 2.4 ms. Our system achieves 1.5\u00d7 higher throughput and 4.4\u00d7 lower latency compared to the current state-of-the-art SSD-based object detection systems on FPGAs.","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556473.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00021","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End FPGA-based Object Detection Using Pipelined CNN and Non-Maximum Suppression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End FPGA-based Object Detection Using Pipelined CNN and Non-Maximum Suppression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556473/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556473/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100019117","fundingName":"Vector Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-End FPGA-based Object Detection Using Pipelined CNN and Non-Maximum Suppression","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060931S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9556475,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00f6khan Akg\u00fcn","affiliation":["Chair of Adaptive Dynamic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany","Centre for Tactile Internet With Human-in-the-Loop (CeTI), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"G\u00f6khan","lastName":"Akg\u00fcn","id":"37086576857"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali","affiliation":["Chair of Adaptive Dynamic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Ali","id":"37086579110"},{"name":"Diana G\u00f6hringer","affiliation":["Chair of Adaptive Dynamic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany","Centre for Tactile Internet With Human-in-the-Loop (CeTI), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"G\u00f6hringer","id":"37393007400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556475","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Power system management","Heuristic algorithms","Voltage","Logic gates","Market research","Hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DVFS","clock gating","power gating","power estimator","fault diagnosis."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556475","abstract":"A major concern with battery-operated devices is power-awareness and its appropriate computing.

Among various efforts of fabrication of such chips, programmable microfluidic device (PMD) is a relatively new technology for implementation of flow-based lab-on-a-chips. A PMD chip is suitable for automation due to its symmetric nature. In order to implement a bioprotocol on such a reconfigurable device, it is crucial to automate sample preparation on a chip as well. Sample preparation, which is a front-end process to produce the desired target concentrations of the input reagent fluid, plays a pivotal role in every bioassay or bioprotocol. In this paper, first, a method referred as dilution algorithm in two steps (DATS) is proposed, which needs only two diluting operations for any target concentration to achieve. Then, we present another method called as dilution algorithm on a small dilution area (DASDA), which needs less area compared to that by DATS. Finally, we propose the heuristic for efficient dilution of biochemical fluids using a PMD chip referred as dilution algorithm in a restricted dilution area (DARDA) that produces more accurate (with less error) target concentration value on a restricted area of the PMD chip in a shorter mixing time. Simulation results reveal that DARDA outperforms a start-of-the-art dilution algorithm applicable for PMD chips in terms of three performance parameters namely mixing time, mixing area and error in target concentration.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556315/9556316/09556480.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"494","publicationTitle":"2021 24th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD53832.2021.00079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design for Restricted-Area and Fast Dilution using Programmable Microfluidic Device based Lab-on-a-Chip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Fluids","Protocols","Shape","Reconfigurable devices","Simulation","Lab-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["programmable microfluidic devices","dilution","mixing","concentration value","sample preparation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Design for Restricted-Area and Fast Dilution using Programmable Microfluidic Device based Lab-on-a-Chip","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556480/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design for Restricted-Area and Fast Dilution using Programmable Microfluidic Device based Lab-on-a-Chip","confLoc":"Palermo, Spain","sourcePdf":"270300a488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083637S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556315","isNumber":"9556316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556315","xplore-issue":"9556316","articleId":"9556480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9556490,"authors":[{"name":"David Castells-Rufas","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Arquitectura de Computadors i Sistemes Operatius, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Castells-Rufas","id":"38275760500"},{"name":"Santiago Marco-Sola","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Arquitectura de Computadors i Sistemes Operatius, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain","Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Marco-Sola","id":"37085473611"},{"name":"Quim Aguado-Puig","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Arquitectura de Computadors i Sistemes Operatius, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Quim","lastName":"Aguado-Puig","id":"37088992547"},{"name":"Antonio Espinosa-Morales","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Arquitectura de Computadors i Sistemes Operatius, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Espinosa-Morales","id":"37088992899"},{"name":"Juan Carlos Moure","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Arquitectura de Computadors i Sistemes Operatius, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Carlos","lastName":"Moure","id":"37348708800"},{"name":"Lluc Alvarez","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Arquitectura de Computadors i Sistemes Operatius, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Lluc","lastName":"Alvarez","id":"37642091100"},{"name":"Miquel Moret\u00f3","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Arquitectura de Computadors i Sistemes Operatius, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Miquel","lastName":"Moret\u00f3","id":"37296755700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556490","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556490","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sequential analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Genomics","Life estimation","Bandwidth","Throughput","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Pre-alignment Filter","Bit-Parallel Alignment","Levenshtein Distance","Genomics","Sequencing"]}],"abstract":"An FPGA accelerator for the computation of the semi-global Levenshtein distance between a pattern and a reference text is presented.

We use an approach based on diagonals that allows for some resource savings while maintaining a very high throughput of 1 alignment per clock cycle. The design is implemented in OpenCL and tested on two FPGA accelerators.

Hardware designers have proposed various accelerators to speed up the execution of CNNs on embedded platforms. Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) is one such generic CNN accelerator for Xilinx platforms that can execute any CNN on one or more DPUs configured on an FPGA. In a period of rapid growth in CNN algorithms and the availability of multiple configurations of CNN accelerators (like DPU), the design space is expanding fast. These design points show significant trade-off in execution time, energy consumption and application performance measured in terms of accuracy. To be able to perform this trade-off, we propose a methodology for energy estimation of a CNN running on a DPU. We build an energy model using characteristics of few CNNs and use this model for energy prediction of other unseen CNNs. We evaluate our approach using 16 different standard and popular CNNs with an average prediction error of 9.9%. Energy estimation can be useful in various scheduling applications where one can choose from multiple CNNs based on its energy consumption. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in a drone that is deployed for detecting objects on the ground.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00019","startPage":"64","endPage":"68","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556500.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EnergyNN: Energy Estimation for Neural Network Inference Tasks on DPU","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Neural networks","Estimation","Predictive models","Time measurement","Hardware","Mobile applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","CNN accelerator","Deep neural networks","Energy estimation","DPU."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"EnergyNN: Energy Estimation for Neural Network Inference Tasks on DPU","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556500/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EnergyNN: Energy Estimation for Neural Network Inference Tasks on DPU","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051902S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9556503,"authors":[{"name":"Keyvan Shahin","affiliation":["Chair of Computer Engineering, Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus, Germany"],"firstName":"Keyvan","lastName":"Shahin","id":"37086919670"},{"name":"Michael Huebner","affiliation":["Chair of Computer Engineering, Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Huebner","id":"37265025200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4243-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"9556503","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computers","Computational modeling","Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processing","Tools","Hardware","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fixed-point Simulation","DSP Systems","FPGA Acceleration","Reconfigurable Hardware Design"]}],"abstract":"Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems can be described using either fixed-point or floating-point for their numeric representations. As the general computers use floating-point representation, software-based simulation tools used for modeling and simulation of the arithmetic operations in DSP systems, use floating-point representation as well. However, synthesizing customized hardware for fixed-point arithmetic operations for FPGAs or ASICs is more efficient compared to their floating-point counterparts. Thus it is necessary to convert the representation of a floating-point simulated algorithm on MATLAB for example, to a fixed-point representation which is more suitable for hardware implementation. While former approaches for this conversion step have always been software-based, like on MATLAB itself, this paper presents a new approach to show the possibility of accelerating it by using hardware width reconfigurable designs.","doi":"10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00055","publicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556314/9556321/09556503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL53798.2021.00055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556321","startPage":"275","endPage":"276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Fixed-Point Simulations Using Width Reconfigurable Hardware Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Fixed-Point Simulations Using Width Reconfigurable Hardware Architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556503/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Fixed-Point Simulations Using Width Reconfigurable Hardware Architectures","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"375900a275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029517S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556314","isNumber":"9556321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556314","xplore-issue":"9556321","articleId":"9556503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9556509,"authors":[{"name":"Maged ElAnsary","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada","Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9583614/9556509/elans-3113354-small.gif","p":["Maged ElAnsary (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc.

The current-biased PUF cell using only 4 NMOS transistors achieves a small area with reduced temperature and supply sensitivity. Optimization on both the stage gain and stage number can reduce the input-referred noise (IRN) and improve the PUF reliability. We further employ an XOR gate to process the amplifier-chain outputs for the final response to improve the energy efficiency and uniqueness. The process- and bias-dependent stage amplification and the nonlinear amplifier-chain multiplication, which can significantly increase the number of modeling parameters and introduce a complex decision boundary respectively, can effectively resist machine learning (ML) modeling attacks.

To utilize data at different clients without moving them to the cloud, algorithms such as the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) have adopted a computation then aggregation model, in which multiple local updates are performed using local data before aggregation. These algorithms fail to work when faced with practical challenges, e.g., the local data being non-identically independently distributed. In this paper, we first characterize the behavior of the FedAvg algorithm, and show that without strong and unrealistic assumptions on the problem structure, it can behave erratically. Aiming at designing FL algorithms that are provably fast and require as few assumptions as possible, we propose a new algorithm design strategy from the primal-dual optimization perspective. Our strategy yields algorithms that can deal with non-convex objective functions, achieves the best possible optimization and communication complexity (in a well-defined sense), and accommodates full-batch and mini-batch local computation models. Importantly, the proposed algorithms are \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">communication efficient</i>\n, in that the communication effort can be reduced when the level of heterogeneity among the local data also reduces.

We assume that the product graph is formed by the Cartesian product of two smaller graphs, which we refer to as graph factors. We pose the product graph learning problem as the problem of estimating the graph factor Laplacian matrices. To capture local interactions in data, we seek sparse graph factors and assume a smoothness model for data. We propose an efficient iterative solver for learning sparse product graphs from data. We then extend this solver to infer multi-component graph factors with applications to product graph clustering by imposing rank constraints on the graph Laplacian matrices. Although working with smaller graph factors is computationally more attractive, not all graphs readily admit an exact Cartesian product factorization. To this end, we propose efficient algorithms to approximate a graph by a nearest Cartesian product of two smaller graphs. The efficacy of the developed framework is demonstrated using several numerical experiments on synthetic and real data.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3115947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09556561.pdf","startPage":"5665","endPage":"5680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3115947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Product Graph Learning From Multi-Domain Data With Sparsity and Rank Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556561/","displayDocTitle":"Product Graph Learning From Multi-Domain Data With Sparsity and Rank Constraints","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556561/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Pratiskha Trust Young Investigator","grantNumber":"SRG/2019/000619"},{"fundingName":"IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, Barcelona, Spain"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Product Graph Learning From Multi-Domain Data With Sparsity and Rank Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-kadambari-3115947-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108412S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9556561","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9556562,"authors":[{"name":"Elsa Siggiridou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Elsa","lastName":"Siggiridou","id":"37085749803"},{"name":"Dimitris Kugiumtzis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Kugiumtzis","orcid":"0000-0002-5337-5688","id":"37076762700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9556562","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Brain modeling","Time series analysis","Indexes","Estimation","Adaptation models","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bacward-in-time selection","cardiovascular system","dimension reduction","electroencephalogram","Granger causality","restricted polynomial models"]}],"abstract":"The causality analysis of multivariate time series and formation of complex networks relies on the estimation of the direct cause-effect from one observed variable to another accounting for the presence of other observed variables. Such effects are quantified by the conditional Granger causality index (CGCI), derived by linear vector autoregressive models (VAR). Dimension reduction approaches have been developed to restrict VAR models, such as the modified backward-in-time selection method (mBTS) giving the restricted CGCI (rCGCI). The rCGCI is limited to linear systems. In this study, we extend the mBTS dimension reduction scheme to polynomial VAR, so as to model nonlinear dynamics and cause-effect relationships and derive the Granger causality measure termed restricted polynomial CGCI (rpCGCI). The complications in the adaptation of mBTS to the restricted polynomial VAR and the construction of the Granger causality index are addressed, involving also a randomization significance test in the steps of mBTS. The rpCGCI has the advantage against other nonlinear Granger causality measures that it can be applied to short time series of high dimension (many observed variables). The simulation study on different types of multivariate stochastic processes and different lengths of generated time series showed the superiority of the proposed rpCGCI as compared to CGCI, rCGCI, pCGCI (using polynomial VAR) and other nonlinear causality measures. Further, rpCGCI was compared favorably to the other measures on signals of heart rate variability, respiration, and oxygen concentration in the blood, as well as multi-channel scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of epileptic patients containing epileptiform discharges.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dimension Reduction of Polynomial Regression Models for the Estimation of Granger Causality in High-Dimensional Time Series","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3114997","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09556562.pdf","startPage":"5638","endPage":"5650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3114997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Dimension Reduction of Polynomial Regression Models for the Estimation of Granger Causality in High-Dimensional Time Series","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9556562/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimension Reduction of Polynomial Regression Models for the Estimation of Granger Causality in High-Dimensional Time Series","sourcePdf":"tsp-kugiumtzis-3114997-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092449S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9556562","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":9556563,"authors":[{"name":"Vaibhav Garg","affiliation":["Deptartment of Communications Engineering, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Garg","orcid":"0000-0002-6639-3324"},{"name":"Alba Pag\u00e8s-Zamora","affiliation":["SPCOM Group, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alba","lastName":"Pag\u00e8s-Zamora","orcid":"0000-0002-7087-7014"},{"name":"Ignacio Santamaria","affiliation":["Deptartment of Communications Engineering, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Santamaria","orcid":"0000-0003-0040-7436"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9556563","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Covariance matrices","Sensors","Sensor arrays","Linear antenna arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Perturbation methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matrix completion","MIMO","multi-switch antenna selection","order estimation","uniform linear array"]}],"abstract":"This letter addresses the problem of order estimation for uniform linear arrays (ULAs) with multi-switch antenna selection in the small-sample regime. Multi-switch antenna selection results in a data matrix with missing entries, a scenario for which existing order estimation methods that build on the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix do not perform well. A direct application of the Davis-Kahan theorem allows us to show that the signal subspace is quite robust in the presence of missing entries. Based on this finding, this letter proposes a matrix completion (MC) subspace-based order estimation criterion that exploits the shift-invariance property of ULAs. A recently proposed shift-invariant matrix completion (SIMC) method is used for reconstructing the data matrix, and the proposed order estimation criterion is based on the chordal subspace distance between two submatrices extracted from the reconstructed matrix for increasing values of the dimension of the signal subspace. Our simulation results show that the method provides accurate order estimates with percentages of missing entries higher than 50\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3116525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09556563.pdf","startPage":"2063","endPage":"2067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3116525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Order Estimation via Matrix Completion for Multi-Switch Antenna Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556563/","displayDocTitle":"Order Estimation via Matrix Completion for Multi-Switch Antenna Selection","volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556563/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n"},{"fundingName":"AEI/FEDER funds of the E.U.","grantNumber":"PID2019-104958RB-C43/C41 and BES-2017-080542"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Order Estimation via Matrix Completion for Multi-Switch Antenna Selection","sourcePdf":"lsp-garg-3116525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117468S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9556563","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9556573,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungtae Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KI-AI, KI-R, KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungtae","lastName":"Lim","orcid":"0000-0002-7185-4666","id":"37086920570"},{"name":"Hanseok Ryu","affiliation":["Korea Aerospace Research Institute, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hanseok","lastName":"Ryu","orcid":"0000-0002-4155-7425","id":"37088889695"},{"name":"Matthew B.

Unfortunately, the existing state-of-the-art approaches for SADS require GPS signals or high-fidelity dynamic UAV models. To address this problem, a novel synthetic airspeed estimation method that leverages deep learning and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for analytical redundancy is proposed. Our novel fusion-based method only requires an inertial measurement unit (IMU), elevator control input, and airflow angles while GPS, lift/drag coefficients, and complex aircraft dynamic models are not required. Additionally, we demonstrate that our proposed temporal convolutional network (TCN) is a more efficient model for airspeed estimation than the renowned models, such as ResNet or bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Our deep learning-aided UKF was experimentally verified on long-duration real flight data and has promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, it is confirmed that our proposed method robustly estimates the airspeed even under dynamic flight conditions where the performance of conventional methods is degraded.","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2021.3117021","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/9568780/09556573.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3117021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-Aided Synthetic Airspeed Estimation of UAVs for Analytical Redundancy With a Temporal Convolutional Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Atmospheric modeling","Estimation","Aircraft","Global Positioning System","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Deep learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","drag","Global Positioning System","Kalman filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","nonlinear filters","remotely operated vehicles","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPS signals","high-fidelity dynamic UAV models","novel synthetic airspeed estimation","unscented Kalman filter","fusion-based method","inertial measurement unit","elevator control input","complex aircraft dynamic models","temporal convolutional network","renowned models","deep learning-aided UKF","flight data","dynamic flight conditions","UAVs","synthetic air data system","SADS","analytical redundancy technique","unmanned aerial vehicles","backup system","air data sensor failures","existing state-of-the-art approaches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial Systems: applications","sensor fusion","field robots","temporal convolutional network","Deep learning","unmanned aerial vehicles","analytical redundancy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Aided Synthetic Airspeed Estimation of UAVs for Analytical Redundancy With a Temporal Convolutional Network","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9556573/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","accessionNumber":"21176444","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Development of Certification Technology for Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems","grantNumber":"21CAUV-B151724-03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007694","fundingName":"Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003565","fundingName":"Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014188","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea","grantNumber":"2021R1A2C1093445"},{"fundingName":"BK21 FOUR"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010449","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-Aided Synthetic Airspeed Estimation of UAVs for Analytical Redundancy With a Temporal Convolutional Network","sourcePdf":"lra-myung-3117021-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171528S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"9568780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","xplore-issue":"9568780","articleId":"9556573","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9556593,"authors":[{"name":"Shuhao Xia","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9556593/xia-3115938-small.gif","p":["Shuhao Xia (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in computer science from ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China, 2017.

The RIS establishes favorable signal propagation environments to enhance data transmission in massive connectivity in such a scenario. Nevertheless, the BS needs to detect active devices and estimate channels to support data transmission in RIS-assisted massive access systems. Furthermore, due to a large number of devices, it is impossible to assign orthogonal signature sequences to the devices as in most of the existing works on RIS-related channel estimation, which yields unique challenges. This paper shall consider a RIS-assisted uplink IoT network and solve the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RIS-related activity detection and channel estimation</i>\n problem. The BS detects the active devices and estimates the separated channels of the RIS-to-device link and the RIS-to-BS link by using non-orthogonal pilot sequences. Due to limited scattering between the RIS and the BS, we model the RIS-to-BS channel as a sparse channel. As a result, by simultaneously exploiting both the sparsity of sporadic transmission in massive connectivity and the RIS-to-BS channels, we formulate the RIS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem as a sparse matrix factorization problem. Furthermore, we develop an approximate message passing (AMP) based algorithm to solve the problem based on the Bayesian inference framework and reduce the computational complexity by approximating the algorithm with the central limit theorem and Taylor series expansion. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Massive Connectivity: Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3115938","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09556593.pdf","startPage":"5693","endPage":"5707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3115938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Massive Connectivity: Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9556593/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","grantNumber":"21ZR1442700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001294"},{"fundingName":"Sichuan Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"2021YFH0014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071090"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Massive Connectivity: Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-shi-3115938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146994S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9556593","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9556606,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9655601/9556606/wang-3117239-small.gif","p":["Jun Wang (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.E. degree in 2016 in information engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with Nation Mobile Communications Research Laboratory.

In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) space-time-frequency non-stationary theoretical channel model is first proposed for 6G THz wireless communication systems employing ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies with long traveling paths. Considering frequency-dependent diffuse scattering, which is a special property of THz channels different from millimeter wave (mmWave) channels, the relative angles and delays of rays within one cluster will evolve in the frequency domain. Then, a corresponding simulation model is proposed with discrete angles calculated using the method of equal area (MEA). The statistical properties of the proposed theoretical and simulation models are derived and compared, showing good agreements. The accuracy and flexibility of the proposed simulation model are demonstrated by comparing the simulation results of the relative angle spread and root mean square (RMS) delay spread with corresponding measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3117239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3117239","startPage":"12312","endPage":"12324","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9655601/09556606.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9655601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel 3D Non-Stationary GBSM for 6G THz Ultra-Massive MIMO Wireless Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"A Novel 3D Non-Stationary GBSM for 6G THz Ultra-Massive MIMO Wireless Systems","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","volume":"70","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9556606/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556606/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61960206006 and 61901109"},{"fundingName":"Frontiers Science Center for Mobile Information Communication"},{"fundingName":"High Level Innovation and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program in Jiangsu"},{"fundingName":"High Level Innovation and Entrepreneurial Talent Introduction Program in Jiangsu"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2020B01 and 2021B02"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2242021R30001"},{"fundingName":"EU H2020 RISE TESTBED2","grantNumber":"872172"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel 3D Non-Stationary GBSM for 6G THz Ultra-Massive MIMO Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-3117239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115102S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9655601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9655601","articleId":"9556606","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9556622,"authors":[{"name":"Fuwei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fuwei","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-0005-7782","id":"37086862959"},{"name":"Lifeng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Lai","orcid":"0000-0002-9493-8248","id":"37085646242"},{"name":"Shuguang Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","School of Science and Engineering, Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data and Future Network of Intelligence Institute, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Shuguang","lastName":"Cui","orcid":"0000-0003-2608-775X","id":"37085824392"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9556622","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of feature selection based on the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ell _1$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n regularized linear regression model, namely LASSO.

In this paper, a novel range instantaneous Doppler (RID) technique based on high-resolution time-frequency distribution (TFD) is proposed to realize the ISAR imaging for maneuvering targets with complex phase fluctuation. After motion compensation, the target signal in a range unit is transformed into high-resolution time-frequency domain by means of the short-time iterative adaptive approach (STIAA), which can avoid the troubled cross-term interference and effectively break through the time-frequency resolution restriction in comparison with the conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Finally, the reconstruction of high-resolution ISAR image for a maneuvering target can be obtained in the RID domain. The effectiveness of the proposed ISAR imaging algorithm is validated by both simulated and real-measured SAR/ISAR data processing results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556628/","displayDocTitle":"High-Resolution ISAR Imaging for Maneuvering Targets Based on Iterative Adaptive Processing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"6217010061, 61801289, 62161029 and USCAST2019-9"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Space Science and Technology Innovation Fund","grantNumber":"SAST2019-071"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Resolution ISAR Imaging for Maneuvering Targets Based on Iterative Adaptive Processing","sourcePdf":"tci-huang-3116381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134755S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"9318600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","xplore-issue":"9318600","articleId":"9556628","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9556730,"authors":[{"name":"Haibao Zhai","affiliation":["East China Branch of State Grid Corporation of China, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haibao","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37088874270"},{"name":"Xingzhi Wang","affiliation":["East China Branch of State Grid Corporation of China, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xingzhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088437319"},{"name":"Minhui Ge","affiliation":["East China Branch of State Grid Corporation of China, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Minhui","lastName":"Ge","id":"37086849137"},{"name":"Zhenglin Yang","affiliation":["China Electric Power Research Institute(Nanjing), Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenglin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088989033"},{"name":"Shuhai Feng","affiliation":["China Electric Power Research Institute(Nanjing), Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shuhai","lastName":"Feng","id":"38666907000"},{"name":"Yuhang Liu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Power Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuhang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088988847"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9229-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9230-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-749X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-7481"}],"articleNumber":"9556730","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Power transmission lines","Time series analysis","Maintenance engineering","Feature extraction","Power grids","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","pattern classification","power engineering computing","power grids","power transmission faults","power transmission lines","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural network","State Grid Dispatching Center","soft-max classifier","short circuit faults","batch normalization","pooling","multilayer convolution","dual-channel fusion","time series","CNN","power grid transmission line warning system","false alarm rate","intelligent fault identification","false alarm data","line feature extraction","convolutional layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmission line faults","false alarm rate","convolutional neural network","dual-channel fusion","fault identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556730","abstract":"In view of the high false alarm rate of the power grid transmission line warning system and the reliance on the post-analysis of operation and maintenance personnel, a fault identification model of the power grid transmission line based on an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed.

However, the demand for computing resources of fault service is often greater than the resource capacity of edge computing terminal. Therefore, based on the cloud-edge collaborative architecture, this paper proposes a collaborative optimization method of cloud and edge computing resources for fault service in distribution network. Firstly, this paper elaborates the characteristics of fault service in distribution network, and describes the possibility of cloud-edge collaborative information interaction and microservice offloading based on container technology. Then, a cloud-edge collaborative service computing model and the microservice model of fault service are established. According to the offloading mechanism, a microservice offloading decision optimization model is established, which take the system operation cost and calculation delay as the comprehensive measuring index. Finally, the method proposed in this paper is simulated by MATLAB, and the simulation results show that this method can effectively reduce the microservice response time of distribution network and meet the computing resource requirements of fault service.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Computational modeling","Systems operation","Simulation","Collaboration","Distribution networks","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distribution network fault service","cloud-edge computing resource collaboration","microservice model","microservice offloading decision"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556733","doi":"10.1109/CICED50259.2021.9556733","startPage":"627","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"2021 China International Conference on Electricity Distribution (CICED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 China International Conference on Electricity Distribution (CICED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9556635/9556582/09556733.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9556582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICED50259.2021.9556733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9556733/","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-Edge Computing Resource Collaborative Optimization Method for Power Distribution Fault Analysis Service","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"7 April 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9556733/","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-Edge Computing Resource Collaborative Optimization Method for Power Distribution Fault Analysis Service","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"202005310000071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057878S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9556635","isNumber":"9556582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9556635","xplore-issue":"9556582","articleId":"9556733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9557223,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Ying","affiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Ying","id":"37088769622"},{"name":"Tan Tangl","affiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Tangl","id":"37089208925"},{"name":"Yuzhe Luo","affiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhe","lastName":"Luo","id":"37089206507"},{"name":"Lvkeshen Shen","affiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lvkeshen","lastName":"Shen","id":"37089207531"},{"name":"Xiao Xie","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangrhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086448603"},{"name":"Lingyun Yu","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lingyun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37593898200"},{"name":"Yingcai Wu","affiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yingcai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407308300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"9557223","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"Circular glyphs are used across disparate fields to represent multidimensional data. However, although these glyphs are extremely effective, creating them is often laborious, even for those with professional design skills. This paper presents GlyphCreator, an interactive tool for the example-based generation of circular glyphs. Given an example circular glyph and multidimensional input data, GlyphCreator promptly generates a list of design candidates, any of which can be edited to satisfy the requirements of a particular representation. To develop GlyphCreator, we first derive a design space of circular glyphs by summarizing relationships between different visual elements. With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning model for glyph parsing. The model can deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into a series of visual elements. Next, we introduce an interface that helps users bind the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles. We evaluate the parsing model through a quantitative experiment, demonstrate the use of GlyphCreator through two use scenarios, and validate its effectiveness through user interviews.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Visualization","Layout","Deep learning","Data mining","Tools","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Glyph-based visualization","machine learning","automatic visualization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114877","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/9663056/09557223.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9663056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GlyphCreator: Towards Example-based Automatic Generation of Circular Glyphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GlyphCreator: Towards Example-based Automatic Generation of Circular Glyphs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557223/","volume":"28","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9557223/","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"34596552","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"62072400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"LR18F020001"},{"fundingName":"Collaborative Innovation Center of Artificial Intelligence"},{"fundingName":"MOE and Zhejiang Provincial Government (ZJU)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GlyphCreator: Towards Example-based Automatic Generation of Circular Glyphs","sourcePdf":"28tvcg01-wu-3114877-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133629S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"9663056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"9663056","articleId":"9557223","onlineDate":"01 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":9557257,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo B.

The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics are used to analyze both solutions in a subset of 2,500 images obtained from a public dataset. Compared to the deterministic implementation, the stochastic circuit presented an average MAE = 1.41, and an average RMSE = 2.47. The analysis considers 1%, 2% and 5% rates for the output bit-flip error. Both implementations yield similar MAE results, but the stochastic solution shows an RMSE up to one order of magnitude lower than the deterministic one. These results imply that a stochastic implementation is preferable instead of a deterministic one in applications prone to output bit-flip errors. It also means that the stochastic solution may be applicable for low-power IoT devices and sensors for cases where approximate results are allowed.","publicationTitle":"2021 5th International Symposium on Instrumentation Systems, Circuits and Transducers (INSCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 5th International Symposium on Instrumentation Systems, Circuits and Transducers (INSCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9557227/9557240/09557257.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INSCIT49950.2021.9557257","doi":"10.1109/INSCIT49950.2021.9557257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9557240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing the Robustness of Deterministic and Stochastic Edge Detection Circuits to Transmission Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparing the Robustness of Deterministic and Stochastic Edge Detection Circuits to Transmission Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557257/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9557257/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing the Robustness of Deterministic and Stochastic Edge Detection Circuits to Transmission Noise","confLoc":"Campinas, Brazil","sourcePdf":"24_Final_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092422S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9557227","isNumber":"9557240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9557227","xplore-issue":"9557240","articleId":"9557257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9557269,"authors":[{"name":"Fathi Amsaad","affiliation":["School of Information Security, Eastern Michigan University (EMU), Ypsilanti, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9557269/amsaa-3117240-small.gif","p":["Fathi Amsaad (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in engineering from The University of Toledo (UT), Toledo, OH, USA, in 2017.

This paper proposes two novel security techniques to enhance the robustness of LPUFs using configurable-based ring oscillator PUFs (CF-ROPUFs). These techniques are the intra-die frequency aware (IFA) approach to improve PUF reliability and the logarithmic gamma function (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Ln_{\\gamma }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) technique to enhance PUF randomness. The lightweight CF-ROPUF design is realized on hardware, and data samples are collected under varying temperatures and supply voltages over a population of 30 Spartan-3E FPGAs. Experimental results of the IFA technique in terms of average Hamming Weight (HM) demonstrate that the percentage of the reliable RO sample frequencies PUF output is 98.5%. For the analysis, PUF reliability is evaluated in terms of accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility, the international organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. The results indicate that the RO samples are accurately measured from the CF-ROPUFs mapped in all the chips. After using the proposed 1-out-of-r coding algorithm, the results demonstrate high average repeatability of 98.2% and a magnified average reproducibility of 99.63%.

In the past, research has extensively focused on dynamically reusing unused frequency bands to optimize spectrum usage, but methods that identify unused resources in space appear to be unexplored. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient whitespace detection pipeline for multi-antenna radio-frequency (RF) transceivers that detects unused resources in both frequency and space. Our spatio-spectral whitespace detection pipeline relies on multi-antenna nonuniform wavelet sampling, which identifies unused frequencies in space at sub-Nyquist sampling rates.

The (ferromagnetic) Ising model, on the other hand, assigns \u00b11 labels to vertices according to an underlying graph structure in a way that if two vertices are connected in the graph then they are more likely to be assigned the same label. In SBM, one aims to recover the underlying clusters from the graph structure while in Ising model, an extensively-studied problem is to recover the underlying graph structure based on i.i.d. samples (labelings of the vertices). In this paper, we propose a natural composition of SBM and the Ising model, which we call the Stochastic Ising Block Model (SIBM).

However, in practice, evaluation primarily relies on the experience of an operator and is often carried out by manual inspection. In this article, we address the challenges of automatic depth evaluation of metal surface defects by virtual of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) techniques. The main contributions are threefold. First, a highly integrated portable ECT device is developed, taking the advantage of an advanced field-programmable gate array (Zynq-7020 system on chip) and provides fast data acquisition and in-phase/quadrature demodulation. Second, a dataset, termed metal defects of different depths by ECT (MDDECT), is constructed using the ECT device by human operators and made openly available. It contains 48000 scans from 18 defects of different depths and liftoffs. Third, the depth evaluation problem is formulated as a time series classification problem, and various state-of-the-art 1-D residual convolutional neural networks are trained and evaluated on the MDDECT dataset. A 38-layer 1-D ResNeXt achieves an accuracy of 93.58% in discriminating the surface defects in a stainless steel sheet with depths from 0.3 to 2.0 mm in the resolution of 0.1 mm. In addition, the results show that the trained ResNeXt1D-38 model is immune to liftoff signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","isJournal":true,"externalId":"2515413","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21176413","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9557318/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Depth Evaluation for Metal Surface Defects by Eddy Current Testing Using Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Project [Real-time In-line Microstructural Engineering (RIME)]","grantNumber":"EP/P027237/1"},{"fundingName":"U.K. Research Centre in Non-Destructive Evaluation (RCNDE)","grantNumber":"EP/L022125/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Depth Evaluation for Metal Surface Defects by Eddy Current Testing Using Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tim-tao-3117367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107121S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9557318","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9557384,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyi Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China"],"firstName":"Xinyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088993553"},{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yang","id":"38182827100"},{"name":"Qi Liu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085607283"},{"name":"Jingzheng Tu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China"],"firstName":"Jingzheng","lastName":"Tu","id":"37088890303"},{"name":"Cailian Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China"],"firstName":"Cailian","lastName":"Chen","id":"38185843900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-4395-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-4396-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9557384","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Photovoltaic systems","Deep learning","Fault detection","Feature extraction","Inverters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault detection and diagnosis","photovoltaic system","IGBT open-circuit fault","compressed sensing","deep learning"]}],"abstract":"The inverter is the most vulnerable module of photovoltaic (PV) systems. The insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is the core part of inverters and the root source of PV inverter failures. How to effectively diagnose the IGBT faults is critical for reliability, high efficiency, and safety of PV systems. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods are widely used for fault detection and diagnosis. Different from traditional diagnosis methods, DL methods use deep neural networks which can automatically extract the useful representative features from raw data. However, DL methods require large amounts of data, which leads to the high cost of communication, storage, and computation. To tackle these issues, a data-driven fault detection and diagnosis method for IGBT open-circuit faults based on compressed sensing (CS) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed in this paper. CS is adopted to compress raw signals, and the optimal value of compression ratio (CR) is determined by considering the trade-off between classification accuracy and model training time. The overlap sampling method is adopted for data segmentation. Meanwhile, overlap sampling can also increase the number of training samples and improve the sample correlation. The compressed signals are segmented and reconstructed into two-dimensional feature maps for model training. Finally, compared with CNN of the same structure, the developed CS-CNN model can compress 85% of data without accuracy loss. The performance comparison with the state-of-the-art networks demonstrates that the test accuracy is 98.68% and the model training time is much shorter than other methods.","doi":"10.1109/INDIN45523.2021.9557384","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 19th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 19th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9557349/9557353/09557384.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN45523.2021.9557384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9557353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis for IGBT Open-circuit Faults in Photovoltaic Inverters: A Compressed Sensing and CNN based Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557384/","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis for IGBT Open-circuit Faults in Photovoltaic Inverters: A Compressed Sensing and CNN based Method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"21 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9557384/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis for IGBT Open-circuit Faults in Photovoltaic Inverters: A Compressed Sensing and CNN based Method","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"PF-000035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074335S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9557349","isNumber":"9557353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9557349","xplore-issue":"9557353","articleId":"9557384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9557389,"authors":[{"name":"Tianfang Xue","affiliation":["Lab. of Networked Control Systems, Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tianfang","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086374500"},{"name":"Peng Zeng","affiliation":["Lab. of Networked Control Systems, Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37313616100"},{"name":"Haibin Yu","affiliation":["Lab. of Networked Control Systems, Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275014500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-4395-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-4396-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9557389","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Job shop scheduling","Processor scheduling","Simulation","Computer architecture","Problem-solving","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed edge computing","regional scheduling task","reinforcement learning","multi-AGV","flow-shop"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel edge-computing based structure to support learning-based decision-making in industry manufacturing field. This structure consists of four functional layers, respectively realizing model establishment, task allocation and task processing work. In order to take full advantage of the distributed computing resources at the edge, the manufacturing computing task can be further decomposed into several sub-tasks, separating the complex computing problem with large problem size into regional scheduling ones with much smaller problem size. All the sub-tasks are allocated to the edges, accomplished by the algorithm deployed on computing devices of region-related edge node, which contributes to faster data-processing and problem-solving speed. A simulation test has been performed in which a multi-AGV scheduling problem was solved according to a distributed reinforcement learning method configured in such edge computing architecture. The objective of each edge node is to acquire AGV schedule of related region that minimizes the makespan. Simulation results demonstrate that this distributed edge computing system can be enabled to learn satisfying solution and converge much faster when it is compared with conventional method applied in centralized architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-based Edge Computing Architecture for Regional Scheduling in Manufacturing System","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 19th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","doi":"10.1109/INDIN45523.2021.9557389","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 19th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9557349/9557353/09557389.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN45523.2021.9557389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9557353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning-based Edge Computing Architecture for Regional Scheduling in Manufacturing System","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9557389/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"21 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-based Edge Computing Architecture for Regional Scheduling in Manufacturing System","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"PF-000477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042458S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9557349","isNumber":"9557353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9557349","xplore-issue":"9557353","articleId":"9557389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9557422,"authors":[{"name":"Farzaneh Nourmohammadi","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, Emden, Germany"],"firstName":"Farzaneh","lastName":"Nourmohammadi","id":"37087011402"},{"name":"Allanazar Jumabayev","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, Emden, Germany"],"firstName":"Allanazar","lastName":"Jumabayev","id":"37088990060"},{"name":"Elmar Wings","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, Emden, Germany"],"firstName":"Elmar","lastName":"Wings","id":"37086245140"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-4395-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-4396-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9557422","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibrations","Biological system modeling","Wind speed","Time series analysis","Neural networks","Rotors","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flettner rotor","anomaly detection","moving median","deep neural networks","long-short term memory","recurrent neural networks"]}],"abstract":"An ECO Flettner rotor has been installed on board the vessel MV Fehn Pollux to reduce the vessel\u2019s carbon emissions and save fuel.

With the advent of IoT technologies and peer-to-peer networks, the significance of mitigating security threats has never been higher. Network Intrusion Detection Systems are used to monitor the traffic in a network to detect any malicious or anomalous behavior. Anomalous behaviour includes different types of attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Probe, Remote-to-Local and User-to-Root. If an attack/anomaly is detected, custom alerts can be sent to the desired personals. In this paper, we explored the effectiveness of various types of Autoencoders in detecting network intrusions. Artificial Neural Networks can parse through vast amounts of data to detect various types of anomalies and classify them accordingly. An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network which can learn both linear and non-linear representations of the data, and use the learned representations to reconstruct the original data. These hidden representations are different from the ones attained by Principal Component Analysis due to the presence of nonlinear activation functions in the network. Reconstruction error (the measure of difference between the original input and the reconstructed input) is generally used to detect anomalies if the autoencoder is trained on normal network data. Here, we compared the performance of 4 different autoencoders on the NLS-KDD dataset to detect attacks in the network. With just reconstruction error, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 89.34% by using a Sparse Deep Denoising Autoencoder.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autoencoder Based Network Anomaly Detection","publicationTitle":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Technology, Engineering, Management for Societal impact using Marketing, Entrepreneurship and Talent (TEMSMET)","doi":"10.1109/TEMSMET51618.2020.9557464","displayPublicationTitle":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Technology, Engineering, Management for Societal impact using Marketing, Entrepreneurship and Talent (TEMSMET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9557352/9557360/09557464.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMSMET51618.2020.9557464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9557360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 Dec. 2020","displayDocTitle":"Autoencoder Based Network Anomaly Detection","conferenceDate":"10-10 Dec. 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9557464/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"10 Dec. 2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autoencoder Based Network Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"23_TEMSMET_2020_paper_37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046656S","chronDate":"10-10 Dec. 2020","xplore-pub-id":"9557352","isNumber":"9557360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9557352","xplore-issue":"9557360","articleId":"9557464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9557491,"authors":[{"name":"Ushakiran Huiningsumbam","affiliation":["amity university, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Ushakiran","lastName":"Huiningsumbam","id":"37088984547"},{"name":"Anjali Jain","affiliation":["amity university, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Anjali","lastName":"Jain","id":"37086026274"},{"name":"Neelam Verma","affiliation":["amity university, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Neelam","lastName":"Verma","id":"37086167583"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0482-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4641-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9557491","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557491","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backpropagation","Training","Weather forecasting","Training data","Artificial neural networks","Tools","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["back propagation network","predictive analysis algorithm","complex process","nonlinear weather data","dynamic","brusque forecasts","weather forecasting","Artificial Neural Network","future weather","weather variables","weather prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","weather forecasting","training data","hidden neurons","Back propagation Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEMSMET51618.2020.9557491","pdfPath":"/iel7/9557352/9557360/09557491.pdf","publicationTitle":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Technology, Engineering, Management for Societal impact using Marketing, Entrepreneurship and Talent (TEMSMET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Technology, Engineering, Management for Societal impact using Marketing, Entrepreneurship and Talent (TEMSMET)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9557360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMSMET51618.2020.9557491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network for Weather Forecasting: A Review","abstract":"Forecasting is considered one of the most imperative and perplex proceedings in the present-day. Weather forecasting is a natural process which entails the prediction of the change in the atmospheric conditions with the passage of time. It has become a core area of studies and analysis for the scientist owing to the brusque forecasts and approaches of weather. Weather forecasting has always been a challenging task. In several cases, scientists and researchers had attempted in establishing a linear association between the input and targeted data of the weather. Since, weather is non-linear and dynamic in nature, the target has shifted to prediction of non-linear weather data. Though weather prediction is relatively a statistical measure and is automated, with the traditional tools, its result is rather uncertain and not always accurate. Due to its non-linearity and complex process, the best approach for resolving such problems is with the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). ANN simplify the weather predictions with its better efficiency, reliability and accuracy. The features of ANN are not just to analyse the past data but also to acquire future predictions rendering to be much ideal for weather forecasting. NN is rather a complicated network which are pliable and flexible in nature. It is autodidactic with its existing training data consequently forging a new smart pattern useful for predicting the weather. Survey of various techniques of NN for weather prediction is provided and it is observed that by simply increasing the number of hidden layers the trained NN can predict and classify the weather variables with minimal error. In this paper, predictive analysis algorithm is incorporated with back propagation network(BPN) to predict future weather by training the network. The technical milestone, where various researchers have acquired on this discipline has been reviewed and presented in these surveys.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 Dec. 2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557491/","accessionNumber":"21201813","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9557491/","publicationDate":"10 Dec. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"10-10 Dec. 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network for Weather Forecasting: A Review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network for Weather Forecasting: A Review","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"15_TEMSMET_2020_paper_138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064237S","chronDate":"10-10 Dec. 2020","xplore-pub-id":"9557352","isNumber":"9557360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9557352","xplore-issue":"9557360","articleId":"9557491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9557519,"authors":[{"name":"Leon Hielscher","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Leon","lastName":"Hielscher","id":"37087098740"},{"name":"Alexander Bloeck","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Bloeck","id":"37088992682"},{"name":"Alexander Viehl","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Viehl","id":"37299382500"},{"name":"Sebastian Reiter","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Reiter","id":"38666887300"},{"name":"Marc Staiger","affiliation":["Staiger GmbH & Co.

They each have their advantages, especially when it comes to BER performance over a wireless channel. They increase the performance of the bandwidth when used along with the OFDM. The FFT usually used in the OFDM system; however, it significantly increased the PAPR. DWT-based OFDM system can be implemented to solve this, and PTS technique can further improve it. This paper aims to do a simulation comparing QAM and PSK's BER performance. Both modulation technique will have the order of 4, 8, 16, 64, and 256.Additionally, the bit order will be Gray-mapped. The signal is implemented in DWT-based OFDM system with PTS technique through AWGN channel. The result shows that the performance of 4-QAM is similar to QPSK. Then, 8-QAM is slightly better than 8-PSK, and as the order gets higher, the QAM shows a much better performance than PSK. The constellation diagram of QAM shows that the distance between each combination is constant for any order. PSK has a smaller distance; thus, it is very rational for QAM to perform better than PSK for the higher-order as 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM.","doi":"10.1109/ICSECC51444.2020.9557556","publicationTitle":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Engineering and Creative Computing (ICSECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Engineering and Creative Computing (ICSECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9557351/9557355/09557556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSECC51444.2020.9557556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9557355","startPage":"5","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of BER Performance for M-ary QAM and PSK on DWT-based OFDM System with PTS Technique Through AWGN Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of BER Performance for M-ary QAM and PSK on DWT-based OFDM System with PTS Technique Through AWGN Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Dec. 2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557556/","conferenceDate":"16-17 Dec. 2020","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"16 Dec. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9557556/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of BER Performance for M-ary QAM and PSK on DWT-based OFDM System with PTS Technique Through AWGN Channel","confLoc":"Indonesia","sourcePdf":"PID007-Vincent.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112649S","chronDate":"16-17 Dec. 2020","xplore-pub-id":"9557351","isNumber":"9557355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9557351","xplore-issue":"9557355","articleId":"9557556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9557572,"authors":[{"name":"Jiawen Xu","affiliation":["Applied Network Technology Lab, Huawei Technologies, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Jiawen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088990147"},{"name":"Matthias Kovatsch","affiliation":["Applied Network Technology Lab, Huawei Technologies, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Kovatsch","id":"37597292400"},{"name":"Sergio Lucia","affiliation":["Lab of Process Automation Systems, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Lucia","id":"37085429834"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-4395-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-4396-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9557572","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Deep learning","Training","Neural networks","Training data","Process control","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault diagnosis","open set recognition","deep learning"]}],"abstract":"AI tasks based on deep neural networks have been widely applied in industrial applications, such as process control, quality inspection or predictive maintenance. Deep neural network classifiers are particularly successful, as they provide powerful and reliable algorithms for many applications such as object recognition and fault diagnosis. However, most deep classifier applications are not able to recognize class samples that are beyond the scope of their training data. Samples of unknown classes (denoted as open set data) lead to significant drops in performance, as the output of deep classifiers is limited to the known classes of the training data (denoted as closed set data). This paper presents a method to recognize open set samples without changing the neural network architecture, the training process, nor the trained models. In our method, we firstly train a neural network for normal closed set fault diagnosis. Then we compare the feature maps of testing samples and known class samples during inference using local outlier factor to recognize open set samples. We evaluate our method with two public datasets and show that our method can increase the overall accuracy by 40% when classifying open set data. Besides, we also compared our method to the state-of-the-art open set recognition approach for fault diagnosis applications and the results show that our method leads to better F1-scores.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open Set Recognition for Machinery Fault Diagnosis","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 19th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","doi":"10.1109/INDIN45523.2021.9557572","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 19th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9557349/9557353/09557572.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN45523.2021.9557572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9557353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Open Set Recognition for Machinery Fault Diagnosis","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9557572/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"21 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open Set Recognition for Machinery Fault Diagnosis","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"PF-003409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071376S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9557349","isNumber":"9557353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9557349","xplore-issue":"9557353","articleId":"9557572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9557639,"authors":[{"name":"Tristan Joseph C.

Motivated by recent applications of coding theory, in this paper, we consider the case where the process of encoding is distributed and prone to error. We introduce the problem of distributed encoding, comprised of a set of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K \\in \\mathbb {N}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n isolated source nodes and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N \\in \\mathbb {N}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n encoding nodes. Each source node has one symbol from a finite field, which is sent to each of the encoding nodes. Each encoding node stores an encoded symbol from the same field, as a function of the received symbols. However, some of the source nodes are controlled by the adversary and may send different symbols to different encoding nodes. Depending on the number of the adversarial nodes, denoted by \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\beta \\in \\mathbb {N}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, and the cardinality of the set of symbols that each one generates, denoted by \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$v \\in \\mathbb {N}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, the process of decoding from the encoded symbols could be impossible.

We formulate a convex relaxation of the problem as a semidefinite program in a real Hilbert space, which allows us to approximate a point in the feasible set by iteratively applying a bounded perturbation resilient fixed-point mapping. Inspired by the superiorization methodology, we use this mapping as a basic algorithm, and we add in each iteration a small perturbation with the intent to reduce the objective value and the distance to nonconvex rank-constraint sets. We prove that the sequence of perturbations is bounded, so the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a feasible point of the relaxed semidefinite program. Simulations show that the proposed approach outperforms existing algorithms in terms of both computation time and approximation gap in many cases.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3117513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09557796.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3117513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5708","endPage":"5722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Group Multicast Beamforming by Superiorized Projections Onto Convex Sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Group Multicast Beamforming by Superiorized Projections Onto Convex Sets","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9557796/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung"},{"fundingName":"Federal Republic of Germany"},{"fundingName":"AI4Mobile ith","grantNumber":"16KIS1170K"},{"fundingName":"Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs"},{"fundingName":"Energy of the Federal Republic of Germany"},{"fundingName":"LIPS ith","grantNumber":"01MD18010E"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multi-Group Multicast Beamforming by Superiorized Projections Onto Convex Sets","sourcePdf":"tsp-fink-3117513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130204S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9557796","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9557817,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet M.

In order to address the extremely high attenuation at THz, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems have been proposed for THz communications to compensate propagation losses. However, the cost and power associated with fully digital beamformers of these huge antenna arrays are prohibitive. In this paper, we develop wideband hybrid beamformers based on both model-based and model-free techniques for a new group-of-subarrays (GoSA) ultra-massive MIMO structure in low-THz band. Further, driven by the recent developments to save the spectrum, we propose beamformers for a joint ultra-massive MIMO radar-communications system, wherein the base station serves multi-antenna user equipment (RX), and tracks radar targets by generating multiple beams toward both RX and the targets. We formulate the GoSA beamformer design as an optimization problem to provide a trade-off between the unconstrained communications beamformers and the desired radar beamformers. To mitigate the beam split effect at THz band arising from frequency-independent analog beamformers, we propose a phase correction technique to align the beams of multiple subcarriers toward a single physical direction. Additionally, our design also exploits second-order channel statistics so that an infrequent channel feedback from the RX is achieved with less channel overhead. To further decrease the ultra-massive MIMO computational complexity and enhance robustness, we also implement deep learning solutions to the proposed model-based hybrid beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both techniques outperform the conventional approaches in terms of spectral efficiency and radar beampatterns, as well as exhibiting less hardware cost and computation time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9634701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3117410","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3117410","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1483","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/9634701/09557817.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557817/","displayDocTitle":"Terahertz-Band Joint Ultra-Massive MIMO Radar-Communications: Model-Based and Model-Free Hybrid Beamforming","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9557817/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ERC Project AGNOSTIC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terahertz-Band Joint Ultra-Massive MIMO Radar-Communications: Model-Based and Model-Free Hybrid Beamforming","sourcePdf":"jstsp-elbir-3117410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134707S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"9634701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","xplore-issue":"9634701","articleId":"9557817","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":9557819,"authors":[{"name":"Shahin Khobahi","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9557819/khoba-3117503-small.gif","p":["Shahin Khobahi (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2016, and the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA, in 2020, respectively.

In this paper, we focus on the extreme case of one-bit quantizers, and propose a deep detector entitled LoRD-Net for recovering information symbols from one-bit measurements. Our method is a model-aware data-driven architecture based on deep unfolding of first-order optimization iterations. LoRD-Net has a task-based architecture dedicated to recovering the underlying signal of interest from the one-bit noisy measurements without requiring prior knowledge of the channel matrix through which the one-bit measurements are obtained. The proposed deep detector has much fewer parameters compared to black-box deep networks due to the incorporation of domain-knowledge in the design of its architecture, allowing it to operate in a data-driven fashion while benefiting from the flexibility, versatility, and reliability of model-based optimization methods. LoRD-Net operates in a blind fashion, which requires addressing both the non-linear nature of the data-acquisition system as well as identifying a proper optimization objective for signal recovery. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage training method for LoRD-Net, in which the first stage is dedicated to identifying the proper form of the optimization process to unfold, while the latter trains the resulting model in an end-to-end manner. We numerically evaluate the proposed receiver architecture for one-bit signal recovery in wireless communications and demonstrate that the proposed hybrid methodology outperforms both data-driven and model-based state-of-the-art methods, while utilizing small datasets, on the order of merely \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim 500$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n samples, for training.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09557819.pdf","startPage":"5651","endPage":"5664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3117503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3117503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LoRD-Net: Unfolded Deep Detection Network With Low-Resolution Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Task analysis","Computational modeling","Training","Quantization (signal)","Maximum likelihood estimation","Detectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model-based deep learning","deep unfolding","machine learning, massive MIMO","low-resolution signal processing","one-bit quantization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"LoRD-Net: Unfolded Deep Detection Network With Low-Resolution Receivers","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9557819/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100020596","fundingName":"Benoziyo Endowment Fund for the Advancement of Science"},{"fundingName":"Estate of Olga Klein \u2013 Astrachan, the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research","grantNumber":"646804-ERC-COG-BNYQ"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"0100101"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1704401"},{"fundingName":"Illinois Discovery Partners Institute"},{"fundingName":"IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, Brighton, U.K."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LoRD-Net: Unfolded Deep Detection Network With Low-Resolution Receivers","sourcePdf":"tsp-khobahi-3117503-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098093S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9557819","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9557826,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungrak Son","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungrak","lastName":"Son","orcid":"0000-0002-2983-985X","id":"37089014482"},{"name":"Aditya Ramamoorthy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames,, USA"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Ramamoorthy","orcid":"0000-0003-3448-1271","id":"37269688700"},{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","orcid":"0000-0003-3930-7088","id":"37088522696"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9557826","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Leveraging the idea of group theory, we explore the distributed matrix multiplication problem posed in on-device edge computing.

In this paper, we consider the employment of the integrated (radar) sensing and communication (ISAC) technique for assisting OTFS transmission in both uplink and downlink vehicular communication systems. Benefiting from the OTFS-ISAC signals, the roadside unit (RSU) is capable of simultaneously transmitting downlink information to the vehicles and estimating the sensing parameters of vehicles, e.g., locations and speeds, based on the reflected echoes. Then, relying on the estimated kinematic parameters of vehicles, the RSU can construct the topology of the vehicular network that enables the prediction of the vehicle states in the following time instant. Consequently, the RSU can effectively formulate the transmit downlink beamformers according to the predicted parameters to counteract the channel adversity such that the vehicles can directly detect the information without the need of performing channel estimation. As for the uplink transmission, the RSU can infer the delays and Dopplers associated with different channel paths based on the aforementioned dynamic topology of the vehicular network. Thus, inserting guard space as in conventional methods are not needed for uplink channel estimation which removes the required training overhead. Finally, an efficient uplink detector is proposed by taking into account the channel estimation uncertainty. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed ISAC-assisted OTFS transmission scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Sensing and Communication-Assisted Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Transmission for Vehicular Networks","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3117404","endPage":"1528","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/9634701/09557830.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"1515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3117404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9634701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557830","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Uplink","Downlink","Channel estimation","Radar","OFDM","Time-frequency analysis","Vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated radar sensing and communication","orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)","vehicular networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Sensing and Communication-Assisted Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Transmission for Vehicular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9557830/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62101232"},{"fundingName":"Australia Research Council under Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP190101363"},{"fundingName":"Linkage Projects LP","grantNumber":"160100708 and LP170101196"},{"fundingName":"UNSW Digital Grid Futures Institute, UNSW, Sydney"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council's Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP210102169"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Sensing and Communication-Assisted Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Transmission for Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-yuan-3117404-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133938S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"9634701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","xplore-issue":"9634701","articleId":"9557830","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":9557837,"authors":[{"name":"Elias Raninen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Raninen","orcid":"0000-0001-7461-5399","id":"37085839694"},{"name":"Esa Ollila","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Esa","lastName":"Ollila","orcid":"0000-0002-0898-5313","id":"37268424200"},{"name":"David E.

Thus, recognizing contextual information correctly is a hurdle for E2E-ASR to reach the production-level. To overcome the limitations of E2E-ASR in recognizing contextual information, this work presents a post-processing followed by E2E-ASR in an algorithmic way, referred to as a word-matching algorithm with backward search (WMA-BS). At first, we allow E2E-ASR to roughly detect the position of target words that has similar pronunciation with desired contextual phrases. After that, given the hypothesis from E2E-ASR with the rough position of target words, WMA-BS estimates the correct target words and decides whether to replace the target words with the contextual phrase or not, according to their phonetic and literal similarity. Applying the proposed method to E2E-ASR achieved relative improvement up to 52.7% in word error rate across several harsh conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving End-to-End Contextual Speech Recognition via a Word-Matching Algorithm With Backward Search","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3117398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09557841.pdf","startPage":"2087","endPage":"2091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3117398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9557841/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Improving End-to-End Contextual Speech Recognition via a Word-Matching Algorithm With Backward Search","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9557841/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving End-to-End Contextual Speech Recognition via a Word-Matching Algorithm With Backward Search","sourcePdf":"lsp-kim-3117398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048444S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9557841","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9557857,"authors":[{"name":"Boming Huang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9610147/9557857/huang-3108762-small.gif","p":["Boming Huang received the B.S. degree in optical information science and technology from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics.

This paper presents an In-Execution Configuration Accelerator (IECA) that realizes an efficient control scheme, exploring architectural data reuse, unified in-execution controlling, and pipelined latency hiding to minimize configuration overhead out of the computation scope. The proposed IECA achieves row-wise convolution with tiny distributed buffers and reduces the size of total on-chip memory by removing 40% of redundant memory storage with shared delay chains. By exploiting a reconfigurable Sequence Mapping Table (SMT) and Finite State Machine (FSM) control, the chip realizes cycle-accurate Processing Element (PE) control, automatic loop tiling and latency hiding without extra time slots for pre-configuration. Evaluated on AlexNet and VGG-16, the IECA retains over 97.3% PE utilization and over 95.6% memory access time hiding on average. The chip is designed and fabricated in a UMC 55-nm process running at a frequency of 250 MHz and achieves an area efficiency of 30.55 GOPS/mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and 0.244 GOPS/KGE (kilo-gate-equivalent), which makes an over \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.0\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.1\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n improvement, respectively, compared with that of previous related works.

However, due to the gradual angle attenuations of the satellite antennas, it is difficult to achieve full frequency multiplex among different beams as terrestrial 5G network. Multi-color frequency reuse is widely adopted in both academic and industry. Beam hopping scheme has attracted the attention of researchers recently due to the allocation flexibility. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the performance benefits of beam hopping compared with multi-color frequency reuse scheme in non-uniform user and traffic distributions in satellite system. Aerial networks are also introduced to form a space-air- ground integrated network for coverage enhancement, and the capacity improvement is analyzed. Besides, additional improved techniques are provided to make comprehensive analysis and comparisons.

Specifically, in the offline training stage, spectrum data captured by the satellite is sent to the TCN deployed on the gateway for training purpose.

In this paper we envision a framework of integrated radio-acoustic network arming at high-efficient data transmission in underwater scenarios, where acoustic signal is for underwater communication and radio signal is for surface and air communications. Since radio links have much higher data transmission rate and lower delay, in the integrated radio-acoustic network, the acoustic links easily become congested, at the same time the radio links are not fully utilized. We therefore propose that the integrated radio-acoustic network should be properly designed to minimize the hop count of acoustic links, as well as the signaling overhead in the acoustic subnetwork.

However, due to the inaccurate voice activity detection (VAD), the residual music noise and enhanced performance still need to be further improved, especially in the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. To address this issue, an improved frame iterative spectral subtraction in the STM domain (IMModSSub) is proposed. More specifically, with the inter-frame correlation, the noise subtraction is directly applied to handle the noisy signal for each frame in the STM domain. Then, the noisy signal is classified into speech or silence frames based on a predefined threshold of segmented SNR. With these classification results, a corresponding mask function is developed for noisy speech after noise subtraction. Finally, exploiting the increased sparsity of speech signal in the modulation domain, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) technique is employed to the speech frames for improving the speech quality and intelligibility. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with three types of noise, including white noise, pink noise, and hfchannel noise. The obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms some established baselines at lower SNRs (\u22125 to +5 dB).","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558716","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Noise measurement","Modulation","Acoustics","Signal to noise ratio","Indexes","Speech coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["short-time modulation domain","singlechannel speech enhancement","modulation improved frame iterative spectral subtraction","low SNRs"]}],"publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9558644/09558716.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.09.009","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.09.009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-channel speech enhancement based on improved frame-iterative spectral subtraction in the modulation domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558716/","displayDocTitle":"Single-channel speech enhancement based on improved frame-iterative spectral subtraction in the modulation domain","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","volume":"18","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-channel speech enhancement based on improved frame-iterative spectral subtraction in the modulation domain","sourcePdf":"9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017485S","chronDate":"Sept.  2021","isNumber":"9558644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9558716","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":9558717,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Ma","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Haowei Wu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China; Center of Communication and Tracking Telemetry Command, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Space Information Network and Intelligent Information Fusion, Chongqing 400044, China"],"firstName":"Haowei","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Liubin Wang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China"],"firstName":"Liubin","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Jinglan Ou","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Space Information Network and Intelligent Information Fusion, Chongqing 400044, China"],"firstName":"Jinglan","lastName":"Ou"},{"name":"Lian Yan","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Yan"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9558717","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"This work investigates the security issue of the energy-constrained untrusted relay network with imperfect channel reciprocity, where the relay without the built-in power supply can only scavenge energy from radio-frequency signals radiated by the source and destination. A hybrid power-splitting (PS)- and time-switching (TS)-based relaying (HPTR) protocol is presented to improve the degraded secrecy performance due to the incomplete self-interference cancellation at the destination. To evaluate the secrecy throughput (ST) of the studied system, the analytical expression of the secrecy outage probability under the delay-limited transmission mode and the closed-form lower bound of the ergodic secrecy capacity under delay-tolerant transmission mode are derived. Both linear and nonlinear models for the energy harvester at the relay are compared. The optimal PS and TS ratios are evaluated numerically. The theoretical derivations are validated by numerical results, revealing that the residual jamming has a negative effect on the secrecy performance of untrusted relay networks, which can be alleviated by the HPTR protocol. Besides, we compare the ST performance of the HPTR protocol with that of the PS and TS relaying schemes, and the results show that the HPTR protocol outperforms both PS and TS relaying protocols in terms of the ST.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558717","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Relay networks (telecommunication)","Mathematical models","Jamming","Integrated circuit modeling","Security","Probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["untrusted relay","physical layer security","secrecy outage probability","ergodic secrecy capacity","energy harvesting"]}],"publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9558644/09558717.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.09.010","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.09.010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid protocol for wireless-powered untrusted relay networks with imperfect channel reciprocity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558717/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid protocol for wireless-powered untrusted relay networks with imperfect channel reciprocity","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","volume":"18","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid protocol for wireless-powered untrusted relay networks with imperfect channel reciprocity","sourcePdf":"10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01556S","chronDate":"Sept.  2021","isNumber":"9558644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9558717","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":9558718,"authors":[{"name":"Yitian Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China"],"firstName":"Yitian","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Shaoshuai Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China"],"firstName":"Shaoshuai","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Guofang Tu","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China"],"firstName":"Guofang","lastName":"Tu"},{"name":"Hao Qiu","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Qiu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9558718","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558718","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Antennas","Correlation","Uplink","Contamination","Massive MIMO","Indexes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["massive MIMO","pilot contamination","pseudo-channel matrix","spatial correlation","superimposed pilots"]}],"abstract":"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), a technique that can greatly increase spectral efficiency (SE) of cellular networks, has attracted significant interests in recent years. One of the major limitations of massive MIMO systems is pilot contamination, which will deteriorate the SE. The superimposed pilot-based scheme has been proved to be a viable method for pilot contamination reduction. However, it cannot break through another limitation of massive MIMO, i.e., spatial correlation. In addition, it will also lead to interference between the pilot and user data since they are imposed together. In this paper, we try to tackle these two issues, which will be described as follows. Firstly, a column-wise asymptotically orthogonal matrix, named as pseudo-channel matrix, is developed by orthogonalization of received signal. To recover the information about the large-scale fading (LSF) coefficients, the pseudo-channel matrix is truncated according to the cardinality of adjacent users set (CAUS). By this means, spatial correlation can be mitigated effectively. Secondly, robust independent component analysis (RobustICA) is used to reduce the interference caused by user data, and as a result the system performance can be further improved. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.09.011","startPage":"130","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9558644/09558718.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.09.011","endPage":"147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudo-channel matrix truncation based spatial correlation mitigation in massive MIMO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Pseudo-channel matrix truncation based spatial correlation mitigation in massive MIMO","volume":"18","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo-channel matrix truncation based spatial correlation mitigation in massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017132S","chronDate":"Sept.  2021","isNumber":"9558644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9558718","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":9558719,"authors":[{"name":"Shifeng Ding","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Suzhou Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Network Technology, Soochow University, China; Jiangsu Engineering Research Center of Novel Optical Fiber Technology and Communication Network, Soochow University, China; Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shifeng","lastName":"Ding"},{"name":"Zile Jiang","affiliation":["Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zile","lastName":"Jiang"},{"name":"Sanjay K.

To ensure guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for each virtual elastic optical network (VEON), clients usually request network resources from a network operator based on their bandwidth requirements predicted from historical traffic demands. However, this may not be efficient as the actual traffic demands of users always fluctuate. To tackle this, we propose a new VEON service provisioning scheme, called SATP, which consists of three stages, i.e., spectrum assignment (SA), spectrum trading (ST), and spectrum purchasing (SP). Unlike conventional once-for-all VEON service provisioning approaches, the SATP scheme first allocates spectrum resources to VEONs according to their predicted bandwidth requirements with a satisfaction ratio \u03b1 (0 < \u03b1 < 1). Then, to minimize service degradation on VEONs which are short of assigned spectra for their peak traffic periods, the scheme allows VEONs to trade spectra with each other according to their actual bandwidth requirements. Finally, it allows VEON clients to purchase extra spectrum resources from a network operator if the spectrum resources are still insufficient. To optimize this entire process, we formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and also develop efficient heuristic algorithms for each stage to handle large test scenarios. Simulations are conducted under different test conditions for both static and dynamic traffic demand scenarios. Results show that the proposed SATP scheme is efficient and can achieve significant performance improvement under both static and dynamic scenarios.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.09.012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.09.012","endPage":"166","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9558644/09558719.pdf","startPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-minimized virtual elastic optical network provisioning with guaranteed QoS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558719/","displayDocTitle":"Cost-minimized virtual elastic optical network provisioning with guaranteed QoS","volume":"18","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-minimized virtual elastic optical network provisioning with guaranteed QoS","sourcePdf":"12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015768S","chronDate":"Sept.  2021","isNumber":"9558644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9558719","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":9558720,"authors":[{"name":"Wenfa Yan","affiliation":["China Mobile Group Design Institute Co., Ltd.

Under the maximum transmit power constraints of the APs and the minimum total energy harvesting power constraints of the ERs, we aim to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) by jointly optimizing the beamforming matrices and the passive RIS reflection matrices. However, the formulated problem is nonconvex and very challenging to solve. Therefore, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. Explicitly, the proposed algorithm decomposes the original optimization problem into three subproblems that can be efficiently solved. To overcome the nonconvexity of the subproblems, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm is proposed to tackle the energy harvesting constraints. Moreover, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm is proposed to optimize the constant modulus constrained RIS reflecting elements.

Specifically, we utilize the sensor and process noise to detect data integrity attacks. Such noise represents the intrinsic characteristics of physical devices and the production process in CPS. One key enabler is that we use a robust deep autoencoder to automatically extract the noise from measurement data. Further, an LSTM-based detector is designed to inspect the obtained noise and detect anomalies. Data integrity attacks change noise patterns and thus are identified as the root cause of anomalies by Deepnoise. Evaluated on the SWaT testbed, Deep-noise achieves higher accuracy and recall compared with state-of-the-art model-based and deep learning-based methods. On average, when detecting direct attacks, the precision is 95.47%, the recall is 96.58%, and F is 95.98%. When detecting stealthy attacks, precision, recall, and F scores are between 96% and 99.5%.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558722","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data integrity","Noise measurement","Anomaly detection","Robot sensing systems","Detectors","Data models","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cyber-physical systems","anomaly detection","data integrity attacks"]}],"publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9558644/09558722.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.09.015","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.09.015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deepnoise: Learning sensor and process noise to detect data integrity attacks in CPS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558722/","displayDocTitle":"Deepnoise: Learning sensor and process noise to detect data integrity attacks in CPS","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","volume":"18","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deepnoise: Learning sensor and process noise to detect data integrity attacks in CPS","sourcePdf":"15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016172S","chronDate":"Sept.  2021","isNumber":"9558644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9558722","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":9558723,"authors":[{"name":"Zhonghong Ou","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghong","lastName":"Ou"},{"name":"Wenjun Chai","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Chai"},{"name":"Lifei Wang","affiliation":["Hebei Eye Hospital, Xingtai 054001, China"],"firstName":"Lifei","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Ruru Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Ruru","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Jiawen He","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Jiawen","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Meina Song","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Meina","lastName":"Song"},{"name":"Lifei Yuan","affiliation":["Hebei Eye Hospital, Xingtai 054001, China"],"firstName":"Lifei","lastName":"Yuan"},{"name":"Shengjuan Zhang","affiliation":["Hebei Eye Hospital, Xingtai 054001, China"],"firstName":"Shengjuan","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Yanhui Wang","affiliation":["Hebei Eye Hospital, Xingtai 054001, China"],"firstName":"Yanhui","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Huan Li","affiliation":["Hebei Eye Hospital, Xingtai 054001, China"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xin Jia","affiliation":["Hebei Eye Hospital, Xingtai 054001, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Jia"},{"name":"Rujian Huang","affiliation":["Hebei Eye Hospital, Xingtai 054001, China"],"firstName":"Rujian","lastName":"Huang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9558723","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558723","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diseases","Deep learning","Feature extraction","Medical diagnostic imaging","Lesions","Data models","Training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","multi modal","long-tail","ophthalmic disease classification"]}],"abstract":"Leveraging deep learning-based techniques to classify diseases has attracted extensive research interest in recent years.

In this paper, NOMA combined with polar codes is used to achieve secure transmission. Both degraded wiretap channel and non-degraded wiretap channel are considered, where an eavesdropper intercepts the communication between base station (BS) and users. For the degraded wiretap channel scenario, a secure polar encoding scheme is proposed in NOMA systems with power allocation to achieve the maximum secrecy capacity. With regard to the non- degraded wiretap channel, a polar encoding scheme with multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system is proposed, where artificial noise is generated at BS to confuse the eavesdropper's channel via transmit beam- forming. The security and the secure rate are employed respectively in order to measure the secrecy performance. We prove that the proposed schemes for each scenario can achieve the secure rate and can transmit the signal securely and reliably.

In the proposed HSE-SPP, a pre-assigned intermediate node on the backup route is chosen for signaling exchange. When connection fails, source and destination nodes simultaneously generate backup connection setup messages to the pre-assigned intermediate node on the reserved backup route. At the intermediate node, signaling process occurs, and acknowledgment is generated for data transmission to the respective end nodes. Consequently, connection recovery time by applying HSE-SPP becomes very low. Simulations are performed for network parameters and results are verified with existing strategies. The average recovery time (RT), bandwidth blocking probability (BBP), bandwidth provisioning ratio (BPR), and resource overbuild (RO) ratio of HSE-SPP for ARPANET is 13.54ms, 0.18, 3.02, 0.55, and for dedicated path protection (DPP) are 13.20ms, 0.56, 6.30, 3.75 and for shared path protection (SPP) 22.19ms, 0.22, 3.23, 0.70 respectively.

Massive low time-constrained and data-intensive mobile applications require efficient replication strategies to decrease retrieval time. However, the determination of replicas is not reasonable in many previous works, which incurs high response delay. To this end, a correlation-aware replica prefetching (CRP) strategy based on the file correlation principle is proposed, which can prefetch the files with high access probability. The key is to determine and obtain the implicit high-value files effectively, which has a significant impact on the performance of CRP. To achieve the goal of accelerating the acquisition of implicit high-value files, an access rule management method based on consistent hashing is proposed, and then the storage and query mechanisms for access rules based on adjacency list storage structure are further presented. The theoretical analysis and simulation results corroborate that CRP shortens average response time over 4.8%, improves average hit ratio over 4.2%, reduces transmitting data amount over 8.3%, and maintains replication frequency at a reasonable level when compared to other schemes.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.09.019","startPage":"249","publicationTitle":"China

This letter describes a frequency modulation approach to improve the Signal to Noise Ratio of the communication link. The technique is based on modulating the toggling frequency of the load switch. It is suitable for standard tags that have only two loads connected to the antenna via a switch. Both coherent and non-coherent demodulations are possible, resulting in feasible options for both external and implantable receivers. Our simulations show 2\u20133 dB improvement in error performance with low complexity transmitters and receivers. Our results indicate that, to improve communication reliability, frequency modulation may be more suitable than coding in ultra-low power sensors.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3117735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09558754.pdf","startPage":"3956","endPage":"3959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3117735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558754/","displayDocTitle":"A Frequency Modulation Technique for SNR Improvement in Backscatter Radios","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9558754/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Frequency Modulation Technique for SNR Improvement in Backscatter Radios","sourcePdf":"lcomm-nagaraj-3117735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056878S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9558754","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9558761,"authors":[{"name":"Hyowoon Seo","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9558761/seo-3117936-small.gif","p":["Hyowoon Seo (Member, IEEE) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering (EE), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2012, 2014, and 2020, respectively.

To this end, a novel random linear combination (RLC)-based PIR scheme that can solve the basic PIR problem and its variation is proposed. The proposed scheme is based on random coding approach and achieves the capacity of the basic PIR asymptotically. Then, we investigate PIR with unknown cache prefetching (PIRC) problem at different cache-to-file size ratio. Specifically, we propose RLC-based PIRC method, which prefetches RLC-based side information and leverages them to retrieve desired information at small download cost. Furthermore, by applying time and memory sharing on the proposed RLC-based PIRC, RLC-based basic PIR and some other known approach in literature, we derive the achievable normalized download cost bound of PIRC. The derived achievable bound outperforms the existing bound in literature and the case study provides numerical results that verifies it.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3117936","startPage":"8132","endPage":"8144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3117936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09558761.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Private Information Retrieval With Unknown Cache Prefetching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558761/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Private Information Retrieval With Unknown Cache Prefetching","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9558761/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014188","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) support program (IITP-2020-0-01787) supervised by the Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014188","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) support program (IITP-2021-0-02048) supervised by the Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Private Information Retrieval With Unknown Cache Prefetching","sourcePdf":"tcomm-choi-3117936-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131632S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9558761","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9558762,"authors":[{"name":"Junjong Lee","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang-si, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558762/jlee-3117719-small.gif","p":["Junjong Lee (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Republic of Korea, in 2019, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree in electrical engineering.

To show that adopting accurate and stable CE methods can considerably increase the QoS requirements of marine networks, the performances of the proposed estimators are analysed in comparison to traditional methods under signal propagations assuming both line of sight (Rician) and Non-line of sight (Rayleigh) conditions. The adoption of a reweighting attractor in addition to the introduction of a variable leakage factor controlled log-sum penalty function to our proposed RER estimator provides additional stability for the estimation of oceanographic channels.

The stencil cleaning operation is necessary to reduce printing defects. The proper control of the cleaning profiles selection process determines the quality and efficiency of the SPP. The wet profile provides high-quality cleaning but requires more time and materials. Dry cleaning is more efficient but cannot provide adequate cleaning quality with high levels of residue. This research aims to develop an intelligent model to guide the stencil cleaning profiles\u2019 decision-making and improve the SPP performance. Stencil cleaning is considered a sequential detection problem. Based on the historical printed boards\u2019 quality measures, a novel feature space is proposed by encoding the time-series printing data into images to better understand the abnormal and trend patterns. The resultant images are classified into the proper cleaning profile through a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model, denoted as cleaning profile classification (CPC) model. Transfer learning is adopted to overcome the limited data problem and enhance the model\u2019s generalization capabilities. The experimental results show that the proposed CNN architecture outperforms other complex state-of-the-art CNN structures in accurately classifying the cleaning profiles, which enhances the overall SPP quality and productivity. The CPC\u2019s actual implementation to control the cleaning profile indicates that the standard deviation of the printing results and the process capability has improved by 34% and 10%, respectively, compared to the best-known cleaning parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9558771/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cleaning Profile Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network in Stencil Printing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cleaning Profile Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network in Stencil Printing","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-yoon-3117539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096846S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"9626376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","xplore-issue":"9626376","articleId":"9558771","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9558782,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Akta\u015f","affiliation":["Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"p":["Mehmet Akta\u015f received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from Rutgers University.

This paper aims to postulate the service rate region as an important consideration in the design of erasure-coded distributed systems. We highlight several open problems that can be grouped into two broad threads: 1) characterizing the service rate region of a given code and finding the optimal request allocation, and 2) designing the underlying erasure code for a given service rate region. As contributions along the first thread, we find the rate regions of maximum-distance-separable, locally repairable, and simplex codes. We show the effectiveness of hybrid codes that combine replication and erasure coding in terms of code design. We also discover fundamental connections between multi-set batch codes and the problem of maximizing the service rate region.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3117695","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3117695","startPage":"7940","endPage":"7963","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9622121/09558782.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558782/","displayDocTitle":"Service Rate Region: A New Aspect of Coded Distributed System Design","volume":"67","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9558782/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award","grantNumber":"CCF-2045694"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CIF-1717314"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Rate Region: A New Aspect of Coded Distributed System Design","sourcePdf":"tit-kazemi-3117695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188606S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9622121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9622121","articleId":"9558782","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9558786,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Karopoulos","affiliation":["Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Ispra, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558786/karop-3117781-small.gif","p":["Georgios Karopoulos received the Ph.D. degree in computer network security from the University of the Aegean, Greece.

This paper contributes the first to our knowledge state-of-the-art and holistic review of this ecosystem, attempting to answer the following questions: 1) is there a harmonization among academia, organizations, and governments in terms of the certificate deployment technology?; 2) what is the proliferation of such schemes worldwide and how similar are they?; 3) are smartphone applications that accompany such schemes privacy-preserving from an end-user\u2019s perspective? To respond to these questions, a four-tier approach is followed: (a) we scrutinize the so far academic works suggesting some type of digital certificate, highlighting common characteristics and weaknesses; (b) we constructively report on the different initiatives proposed by organizations or alliances; (c) we briefly review 54 country initiatives around the globe; and (d) we analyze both statically and dynamically all official Android smartphone applications offered for such certificates to reveal possible hiccups affecting the security or privacy of the end-user. From a bird\u2019s eye view, the great majority of the proposed or developed schemes follow either the blockchain model or the asymmetric cryptosystem, the spread of schemes especially in Europe and partly in Asia is high, some degree of distinctiveness among the relevant schemes developed by countries does exist, and there are substantial variations regarding the privacy level of the applications between Europe on the one hand and Asia and America on the other.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558786.pdf","startPage":"138003","endPage":"138025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Digital Certificates Approaches for the COVID-19 Pandemic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blockchains","Vaccines","COVID-19","Privacy","Pandemics","Scalability","Immune system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vaccination certificates","digital certificates","digital immunization record","COVID-19","information security","data security","privacy","mobile applications","android applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Digital Certificates Approaches for the COVID-19 Pandemic","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9558786/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey on Digital Certificates Approaches for the COVID-19 Pandemic","sourcePdf":"access-karopoulos-3117781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189287S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558786","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9558788,"authors":[{"name":"Yuta Sakai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Yuta Sakai (Member, IEEE) was born in Japan, in 1992.

Due in part to a crucial relation between the variable-length and fixed-length compression problems, our analysis requires a careful and refined analysis of the fundamental limits of fixed-length compression in the setting where the error probabilities are allowed to approach either zero or one polynomially in the blocklength. To obtain the refinements, we employ tools from moderate deviations and strong large deviations. Finally, we provide the third-order asymptotics for the problem of variable-length compression with non-vanishing error probabilities. We show that unlike several other information-theoretic problems in which the third-order asymptotics are known, for the problem of interest here, the third-order term depends on the permissible error probability.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9622121/09558788.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3117591","startPage":"7708","endPage":"7722","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3117591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Third-Order Asymptotics of Variable-Length Compression Allowing Errors","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"67","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9558788/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) Fellowship","grantNumber":"R-263-000-D02-281"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP 21K21291"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Third-Order Asymptotics of Variable-Length Compression Allowing Errors","sourcePdf":"tit-sakai-3117591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104955S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9622121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9622121","articleId":"9558788","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9558789,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid Ibrahim","affiliation":["International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan","COMSATS University Islamabad, Wah Campus, Wah Cantt, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558789/ibrah-3117563-small.gif","p":["Khalid Ibrahim received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Peshawar, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Specifically, we consider a practical system model where the RISs with different geometric sizes are distributively deployed, and wireless channels associated to different RISs are assumed to be independent but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.). We propose two purpose-oriented multi-RIS-aided schemes, namely, the exhaustive RIS-aided (ERA) and opportunistic RIS-aided (ORA) schemes. A mathematical framework, which relies on the method of moments, is proposed to statistically characterize the end-to-end (e2e) channels of these schemes. It is shown that either a Gamma distribution or a Log-Normal distribution can be used to approximate the distribution of the magnitude of the e2e channel coefficients in both schemes. With these findings, we evaluate the performance of the two schemes in terms of outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC), where tight approximate closed-form expressions for the OP and EC are derived. Representative results show that the ERA scheme outperforms the ORA scheme in terms of OP and EC. In addition, under i.n.i.d. fading channels, the reflecting element settings and location settings of RISs have a significant impact on the system performance of both the ERA or ORA schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3117599","startPage":"8641","endPage":"8658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09558795.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3117599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-RIS-Aided Wireless Systems: Statistical Characterization and Performance Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Analytical models","Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels","Performance analysis","Log-normal distribution","Gamma distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)","multi-RIS","Gamma distribution","Log-Normal distribution","method of moments","ergodic capacity","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Multi-RIS-Aided Wireless Systems: Statistical Characterization and Performance Analysis","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9558795/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","grantNumber":"110-2222-E-224-003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1763627 and DGE-1820640"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-RIS-Aided Wireless Systems: Statistical Characterization and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcomm-do-3117599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079818S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9558795","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9558804,"authors":[{"name":"Huaijin Zhang","affiliation":["Research Center of 6G Mobile Communications, School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Huaijin","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-9713-7470"},{"name":"Dejin Kong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of New Textile Materials and Advanced Processing Technologies, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Dejin","lastName":"Kong","orcid":"0000-0001-7119-9895"},{"name":"Yu Xin","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Xin","orcid":"0000-0002-6045-1095"},{"name":"Lixia Xiao","affiliation":["Research Center of 6G Mobile Communications, School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lixia","lastName":"Xiao","orcid":"0000-0001-7959-8356"},{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["Research Center of 6G Mobile Communications, School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0002-8482-1046"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9558804","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Indexes","Modulation","Bit error rate","Interference","Upper bound","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filter bank OFDM (FB-OFDM)","index modulation (IM)","BER performance analysis"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter Bank Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing With Index Modulation","abstract":"Filter bank orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(FB-OFDM) is a promising multicarrier technique due to its ability to significantly reduce out-of\u2013band (OOB) emission.

However, many modern applications need a better level of security that includes saving data from internal breaches. Thus, cloud databases need effective security mechanisms to keep track of data modifications. This paper will introduce the enhanced structure of cloud relational database (RDB) based on blockchain technology (BC) named BC over cloud-RDB. Through a self-verification mechanism, it enables the client to detect and prevent erroneous RDB manipulation. We proposed two systems to improve cloud-RDB namely, agile BC-based RDB and secure BC-based RDB. Both are distributed among several cloud service providers based on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus. Additionally, both rely on linking records to each other using the SHA-256. At the same time, secure BC-based RDB uses a proof-of-work consensus to make data offensive operation impossible. On the basis of performance of both systems\u2019 and security analysis, the agile BC-based RDB is highly suggested for the high throughput database. On the other hand, the secure BC-based RDB is recommended for RDB that contains sensitive data and low throughput performance. The improved RDB is flexible and can be operated according to the data owner\u2019s specifications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558818.pdf","startPage":"137353","endPage":"137366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Blockchain in Cloud Computing to Enhance Relational Database Security","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Cryptography","Security","Data models","Computational modeling","Relational databases","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","cloud computing","confidentiality","homomorphic encryption","integrity","privacy","relational database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Using Blockchain in Cloud Computing to Enhance Relational Database Security","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9558818/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004595","fundingName":"Universiti Sains Malaysia","grantNumber":"LRGS/MRUN: 203.PKOMP.6777005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Using Blockchain in Cloud Computing to Enhance Relational Database Security","sourcePdf":"access-awadallah-3117733-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168634S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558818","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9558821,"authors":[{"name":"Alice Faisal","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, Canada"],"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Faisal","orcid":"0000-0001-8934-4739"},{"name":"Ibrahim Al-Nahhal","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, Canada"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Al-Nahhal","orcid":"0000-0002-8604-392X"},{"name":"Octavia A.

Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-coded OFDM waveforms are introduced, which allow it to be free from range-dependent angle errors. These are readily used to provide both time-domain multiplexing and frequency-domain multiplexing in the MIMO OFDM radar. The DFT- coded frequency-domain multiplexing shortens the maximum unambiguous range, while the DFT- coded time-domain multiplexing lowers the maximum Doppler ambiguity. A hybrid of both domain multiplexing techniques can mitigate the respective limitations by adaptively selecting the proper DFT matrix size in each multiplexing domain. This allows to solve the intrinsic range and Doppler ambiguity problems of MIMO radars by controlling the hybrid ratio of the two kinds of DFT- code based multiplexing methods. Range-Doppler and range-angle maps of four examples with different hybrid multiplexing ratios are simulated with a MIMO OFDM radar numerical platform.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"137793","endPage":"137808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-and-Frequency Hybrid Multiplexing for Flexible Ambiguity Controls of DFT-coded MIMO OFDM Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-and-Frequency Hybrid Multiplexing for Flexible Ambiguity Controls of DFT-coded MIMO OFDM Radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9558823/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Korea Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)], High Resolution Intelligent Radcomm System","grantNumber":"2019-0-00826"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Time-and-Frequency Hybrid Multiplexing for Flexible Ambiguity Controls of DFT-coded MIMO OFDM Radar","sourcePdf":"access-suh-3117980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162088S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558823","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9558831,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Ghaffari","affiliation":["Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558831/ghaff-3117560-small.gif","p":["Alireza Ghaffari received the B.Sc. degree from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Iran, and the M.Sc. degree from Laval University, Canada, both in electrical engineering.

In many applications, the design space is defined by multiple variables and their interactions. Although brute-force analysis is very simple, it is rarely scalable when the number of variables in the system increases. With the rising complexity of hardware designs, more intelligent approaches are needed to explore the design options. This paper proposes using smart meta-heuristic search algorithms such as Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) in conjunction with Bayesian Optimization (BO) to solve this problem. We show that we can further reduce the design effort using a surrogate model that is created based on a novel hybrid GWO-BO method. The surrogate model is a useful abstraction to detect functional and physical inter-dependencies in the system in order to accurately predict its performance (e.g. throughput or latency). We evaluate our methodology and show that it can produce competitive results in order to find the best design variables that maximize the performance of the system. Finally, we compare our results with previous statistical and heuristic methods proposed in the literature and find that the proposed GWO-BO method always performs better than the other considered methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Design Space Exploration of OpenCL Kernels for FPGA Targets Using Black Box Optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117560","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558831.pdf","startPage":"136819","endPage":"136830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558831/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Design Space Exploration of OpenCL Kernels for FPGA Targets Using Black Box Optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9558831/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Design Space Exploration of OpenCL Kernels for FPGA Targets Using Black Box Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-ghaffari-3117560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081749S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558831","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9558835,"authors":[{"name":"Turker Ince","affiliation":["Izmir University of Economics, Izmir, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558835/ince-3117603-small.gif","p":["Turker Ince received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (UMass-Amherst), in 2001.

Recently many studies investigated machine learning monitoring methods especially based on Deep Learning networks focusing mostly on detecting bearing faults; however, none of them addressed bearing fault severity classification for early fault diagnosis with high enough accuracy. 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have indeed achieved good performance for detecting RM bearing faults from raw vibration and current signals but did not classify fault severity. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the limitation in terms of learning capability of conventional CNNs attributed to the basic underlying linear neuron model. Recently, Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) were proposed to enhance the learning capability of CNN by introducing non-linear neuron models and further heterogeneity in the network configuration. In this study, we propose 1D Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs) with generative neurons for bearing fault severity classification and providing continuous condition monitoring. Experimental results over the benchmark NSF/IMS bearing vibration dataset using both x- and y-axis vibration signals for inner race and rolling element faults demonstrate that the proposed 1D Self-ONNs achieve significant performance gap against the state-of-the-art (1D CNNs) with similar computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117603","startPage":"139260","endPage":"139270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558835.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Bearing Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery by 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558835/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Early Bearing Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery by 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9558835/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21176532","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014438","fundingName":"Danfoss, Konecranes and Raute within Business Finland funded INDEX Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Early Bearing Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery by 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-ince-3117603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082604S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558835","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9558838,"authors":[{"name":"Issa Atoum","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, The World Islamic Sciences and Education, Amman, Jordan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558838/atoum-3117989-small.gif","p":["Issa Atoum received the M.Sc. degree in computer science from Philadelphia University, Jordan, and the Ph.D. degree in software engineering from Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Malaysia.

It aims to detect and correct errors that prevail in the specified requirements. Although there are tremendous requirements validation approaches, some software may fail because of limited or ineffective requirements validation techniques and unreliable requirements\u2019 quality characteristics. In this study, a systematic literature review of requirements validation is performed. The study analyzes the most adopted validation techniques, reports requirements quality characteristics, and discovers significant challenges of validation techniques. The review identified 66 relevant primary studies analyzed to derive deep insights into the following aspects of requirements validation: trends of requirements validation methods, including their subtechnique strengths and weaknesses, requirements quality characteristics categories, and adopted tools and datasets in these techniques. We grouped validation techniques into categories: prototyping, inspection, knowledge-oriented, test-oriented, modeling and assessment, and formal models. The analysis reported 19 validation techniques, 27 tools, new requirements validation characteristics, and several challenges that prevailed through validation techniques. The trend of validation techniques is to those methods that apply machine learning techniques with knowledge from dictionaries and ontologies. Most challenges are about how to express the requirements and how to revert clients\u2019 feedback. There is a strong relationship between validation techniques, software application domain, and requirements validation quality attributes. Thus, there is an immense need to unify the quality characteristics and domain-specific validation methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558838.pdf","startPage":"137613","endPage":"137634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558838/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Challenges of Software Requirements Quality Assurance and Validation: A Systematic Literature Review","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9558838/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Challenges of Software Requirements Quality Assurance and Validation: A Systematic Literature Review","sourcePdf":"access-atoum-3117989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120091S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558838","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9558843,"authors":[{"name":"Donghyuk Yun","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558843/yun-3117601-small.gif","p":["Donghyuk Yun received the B.S. degree in electronic communication engineering from Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic communication engineering.

We irradiated the target sample using an X-ray to observe the reactions of the mitigation circuit when various combinations of multiple rows are hammered. The results showed a four times reduction in the number of hammering thresholds under the one-row hammering test. The same radiated sample showed no errors when one or a few rows were hammered due to the built-in mitigation circuit. However, multiple rows hammering (MRH) demonstrated its effectiveness by generating errors despite an active mitigation circuit. In this paper, we explore the X-ray damage results in the aging of the DRAM sample and induces vulnerabilities from the row hammering error perspective. Also, we use the error bits detected by MRH to investigate the coverage pitfalls of the mitigation circuit employed in the sample DRAM. Finally, we newly evaluate the remaining retention time under row hammering stress to explain the coverage loss in the mitigation strategy based solely on hammering counts.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558843.pdf","startPage":"137514","endPage":"137523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploitations of Multiple Rows Hammering and Retention Time Interactions in DRAM Using X-Ray Radiation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Exploitations of Multiple Rows Hammering and Retention Time Interactions in DRAM Using X-Ray Radiation","htmlLink":"/document/9558843/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2020R1H1A2103043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Exploitations of Multiple Rows Hammering and Retention Time Interactions in DRAM Using X-Ray Radiation","sourcePdf":"access-yun-3117601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096925S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558843","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9558845,"authors":[{"name":"Ping-Chun Huang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558845/huang-3117870-small.gif","p":["Ping-Chun Huang received the B.S. degree from the Department of Medical Informatics, Chung Shan Medical University, Taiwan, in 2019, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, in 2021.

Recently, edge computing, which offloads tasks from user devices to nearby edge servers, has been exploited to avoid the long latency associated with cloud computing. However, edge server placement and task allocation strongly affect the offloading process and the quality of a user\u2019s experience. Therefore, appropriately deploying the edge servers within a network and evenly allocating the workload to the servers are vital. This paper thus considers both the workload of edge servers and the distances involved in offloading tasks to these servers. To improve the user experience, edge server locations are carefully selected and the workload for the servers are allocated in a balanced manner. This scenario is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, and a novel solution that searches for the best server placement using simulated annealing while integrating task allocation using the Lagrangian duality theory with the sub-gradient method is proposed.

In order to resolve this problem, we present a new DBN-fuzzy system based on the combination of MRAM-based DBNs and fuzzy systems in the interest of improving the accuracy of MRAM-based neural networks. First, the MRAM-based DBN is employed to identify the top recognition results with the highest probability. Second, the fuzzy system is utilized to obtain the top-1 recognition results. We assess the accuracy of neural networks on the MNIST dataset, finding that the top-1 accuracy of the DBN-fuzzy neural network is improved from 64% to 82% in comparison to the MRAM-based DBNs for a \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$784\\times10$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n network.","doi":"10.1109/JXCDC.2021.3117489","startPage":"125","endPage":"131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Exploratory Solid-State Computational Devices and Circuits","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JXCDC.2021.3117489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9614983","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Exploratory Solid-State Computational Devices and Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570653/9614983/09558846.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Accuracy Deep Belief Network: Fuzzy Neural Networks Using MRAM-Based Stochastic Neurons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558846/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-Accuracy Deep Belief Network: Fuzzy Neural Networks Using MRAM-Based Stochastic Neurons","volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9558846/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"Center for Probabilistic Spin Logic for Low-Energy Boolean and Non-Boolean Computing (CAPSL), one of the Nanoelectronic Computing Research (nCORE) Centers as task 2759.006, a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) Program sponsored by the NSF","grantNumber":"CCF 1739635"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"High-Accuracy Deep Belief Network: Fuzzy Neural Networks Using MRAM-Based Stochastic Neurons","sourcePdf":"jxcdc-pourmeidani-3117489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07112S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"6570653","isNumber":"9614983","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570653","xplore-issue":"9614983","articleId":"9558846","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9558848,"authors":[{"name":"Yunchou Xing","affiliation":["NYU WIRELESS, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yunchou","lastName":"Xing","orcid":"0000-0003-0378-2696"},{"name":"Theodore S.

Firstly, the problem of multi-emitter localization is transformed to that of sparse recovery, whose sparse dictionary is constructed based on the lognormal signal propagation model. Besides, we replace the Gaussian prior in the conventional hierarchical model with the Laplace prior to enhance the localization accuracy. Finally, the sparse recovery problem is solved under the sparse Bayesian learning framework, where the priori knowledge is incorporated to increase localization accuracy further.

With the scaling of device dimensions, semiconductor manufacturing back-end Final Test (FT) yield is increasingly influenced by systematic or random process variations. As a result, the FT yield is not fully guaranteed by design phase optimization due to existing limitations of yield simulation models and coverage. Very few studies have attempted to incorporate the production FT yield data into process variation optimization and inverse design. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for FT yield optimization and Wafer Acceptance Test (WAT) parameter inverse design using multi-objective optimization algorithms.

In the OB-based transmission, the data unit of a packet is divided into two parts: OBs and conventional bits (CBs). The OBs are not physically transmitted but used to indicate the index of the time slot (TS) when the packet containing CBs is transmitted. The loading of a bulk of OB-based packets into multiple TSs can be modelled as a Repeated Balls-into-Bins process with a multi-queue storage. If the bulk is not large enough, certain combination(s) of OBs will not appear, which leaves certain TS(s) empty and hence reduces the TS load efficiency. To evaluate the OB-based transmission performance, we formulate its maximal payload rate and TS load efficiency. With the aid of these two formulations, the energy gain, the goodput, and the latency of OB-based short-packet communications are derived and obtained in analytical forms. For achieving further insights, illustrative numerical results on the resource utilisation efficiency and the performance not only substantiate the advantages of the OB-based transmission over the conventional but also provide useful tools and specifications for its design in massive short-packet communications.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3117606","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09558868.pdf","startPage":"8085","endPage":"8099","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3117606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Bits in Short-Packet Communications: A Finite Blocklength Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Bits in Short-Packet Communications: A Finite Blocklength Perspective","volume":"69","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9558868/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1807802, 2019YFE0113200, 2018YFB2202202 and 2016ZX03001018-005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771188"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Bits in Short-Packet Communications: A Finite Blocklength Perspective","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yang-3117606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117003S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9558868","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9558869,"authors":[{"name":"Sudeep Tanwar","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558869/tanwa-3117848-small.gif","p":["Sudeep Tanwar (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Tech. degree from Kurukshetra University, India, in 2002, the M.Tech. degree (Hons.) from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi, India, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in wireless sensor network from Mewar University, India, in 2016.

It gives an edge over the traditional centralized methods as it provides decentralization, immutability, integrity, and anonymity. The most popular application of this technology is cryptocurrencies, which showed a massive rise in their popularity and market capitalization in recent years. Individual investors, big institutions, and corporate firms are investing heavily in it. However, the crypto market is less stable than traditional commodity markets. It can be affected by many technical, sentimental, and legal factors, so it is highly volatile, uncertain, and unpredictable. Plenty of research has been done on various cryptocurrencies to forecast accurate prices, but the majority of these approaches cannot be applied in real-time. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based hybrid model (includes Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) to predict the price of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Litecoin</i>\n and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Zcash</i>\n with inter-dependency of the parent coin. The proposed model can be used in real-time scenarios and it is well trained and evaluated using standard data sets. Results illustrate that the proposed model forecasts the prices with high accuracy compared to existing models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558869.pdf","startPage":"138633","endPage":"138646","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Scheme With Inter-Dependent Relations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Scheme With Inter-Dependent Relations","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9558869/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21176512","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning-Based Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Scheme With Inter-Dependent Relations","sourcePdf":"access-tanwar-3117848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135374S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558869","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9558870,"authors":[{"name":"Sunisa Rimcharoen","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, Burapha University, Saen Suk, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9558870/rimch-3117987-small.gif","p":["Sunisa Rimcharoen received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from Burapha University, Chon Buri, Thailand, in 2003, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Chulalongkorn University, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.

Ring-based crossover methods are designed to address the shortcomings of traditional crossover techniques; for example, the ends of binary-encoded chromosomes tend to remain unaltered, even when their fitness values are low. By conjoining the leftmost and rightmost parts of a chromosome to form a ring, the ring-based crossovers allow offspring bits to be inherited from parent bits at the front and rear positions. Such a ring-based technique helps increase population diversity while requiring a relatively low number of fitness evaluations. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no comparative study or comprehensive analysis of ring-based crossover techniques. In this paper, we study and compare the characteristics of various existing ring-based crossover techniques (i.e., circle-ring (CRC), annular (AC), ring (RC) and front-rear crossover (FRC)). Although they each have distinct characteristics, they share a common crossover concept: bits at different positions can be swapped. We propose a generalized ring-based crossover (GRC) as an umbrella of the ring-based crossovers, embodying all of their beneficial characteristics. Chromosome shifting, ring forming, chromosome exchange and offspring creation are integrated into the proposed model. The experimental results show that GRC outperforms the other ring-based crossover methods in all experiments, and these results are consistent with the results of behavioral analysis. In a trap problem, GRC outperformed the state-of-the-art BOA method and require 40-times fewer fitness evaluations. GRC tends to maintain a variety of candidates in populations and to preserve the building blocks of solution, and it requires 93% and 57% fewer fitness evaluations (on average) compared to traditional crossover and other ring-based crossover methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117987","startPage":"137902","endPage":"137922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09558870.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ring-Based Crossovers in Genetic Algorithms: Characteristic Decomposition and Their Generalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558870/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ring-Based Crossovers in Genetic Algorithms: Characteristic Decomposition and Their Generalization","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9558870/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21200402","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006749","fundingName":"Faculty of Informatics, Burapha University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Ring-Based Crossovers in Genetic Algorithms: Characteristic Decomposition and Their Generalization","sourcePdf":"access-leelathakul-3117987-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118124S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9558870","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9558872,"authors":[{"name":"Runyuan Guo","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/9612611/9558872/guo-3117981-small.gif","p":["Runyuan Guo received the B.S. degree in measurement and control technology from Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, China, in 2014, and the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2018, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering.","His current research interests include computer vision-based weld defect detection, industrial artificial intelligence, complex process data processing, and deep learning-based soft sensor.

Modeling errors between the mechanism model and real system can occur, which affect the accuracy of the mechanism-driven sensing result. Furthermore, deep learning-based data-driven soft sensors are complex black boxes, resulting in a lack of interpretability in terms of the established model and a lack of reliability regarding the sensing results. To solve these problems, this paper introduces the generative adversarial network (GAN) for soft sensor modeling and establishes an innovative GAN-based hybrid mechanism- and data-driven soft sensor framework. Meanwhile, considering the dynamic characteristics of the industrial process, a deep gated recurrent unit (DGRU) was adopted to compensate for the modeling errors in the mechanism model. This deep learning-based data-driven model not only captures the timing relationship between sensor data but also uses numerous unlabeled data. The generator to be identified in the GAN consists of the DGRU and mechanism model. In an industrial case for predicting the rotor thermal deformation of an air preheater in a power station boiler, the effectiveness and superiority of the hybrid-driven dynamic soft sensor model were verified, and the post hoc interpretability of the model was explained by manipulating the latent variables.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9558872/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2021","volume":"21","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Mechanism- and Data-Driven Soft Sensor Based on the Generative Adversarial Network and Gated Recurrent Unit","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61973248 and 61833013"},{"fundingName":"Key Project of Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2018ZDXM-GY-089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Mechanism- and Data-Driven Soft Sensor Based on the Generative Adversarial Network and Gated Recurrent Unit","sourcePdf":"jsen-liu-3117981-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146587S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9612611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9612611","articleId":"9558872","onlineDate":"04 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9558886,"authors":[{"name":"Yigit Bilgin","affiliation":["\u00d6zye\u011fin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yigit","lastName":"Bilgin","id":"37088990259"},{"name":"Shewit W.

In addition, the dataset is expanded by continuous labeling to create big data. In the study, it is aimed to detect objects using cloud-based deep learning methods with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In the study, training processes were carried out with Google Colaboratory, a cloud service provider. The training processes are a YOLO-based system, and a convolutional neural network was created by revising the parameters in line with the needs. The convolutional neural network model provides communication between neurons in the convolutional layers by bringing the image data to the desired pixel ranges. Unlabeled pictures are included in the training by being tagged. In this way, it is possible to continuously enlarge the data pool. Since the microcomputers used in UAVs are insufficient for these processes, a cloud-based training model has been created. As a result of the study, cloud-based deep learning models work as desired. It is possible to show the accuracy of the model with the low losses seen in the loss functions and the mAP value. Graphic cards with high processing power are needed to provide training.

While the perception of faces and facial expressions is a natural skill for humans, it still poses great challenges for computer systems. These difficulties result from the non-uniformity of the human face and differences in conditions such as lighting, shadows, face pose and orientation. Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have great potential to deal with these challenges due to their powerful automatic feature extraction and computational efficiency. In this study, a CNN model is proposed to classify seven different emotions (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sadness, surprise and neutral) using the FER-2013 dataset. With the proposed model, 70.62% accuracy on the training data and 70% on the test data has been achieved. The loss value was found to be 0.80 at the training stage and 0.86 at the testing stage.","doi":"10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558917","startPage":"570","endPage":"574","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9558874/9558875/09558917.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion Analysis from Facial Expressions Using Convolutional Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Emotion recognition","Computational modeling","Face recognition","Training data","Lighting","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["facial expression recognition","FER-2013","convolutional neural networks","deep learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Emotion Analysis from Facial Expressions Using Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9558917/","publicationDate":"15 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion Analysis from Facial Expressions Using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1431-Emotion-Analysis-Irmak.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047201S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9558874","isNumber":"9558875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9558874","xplore-issue":"9558875","articleId":"9558917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":9558926,"authors":[{"name":"Ilkin Aliyev","affiliation":["Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ilkin","lastName":"Aliyev","id":"37086056738"},{"name":"Joshua Mack","affiliation":["The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Mack","id":"37085719310"},{"name":"Nirmal Kumbhare","affiliation":["The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Nirmal","lastName":"Kumbhare","id":"37086032148"},{"name":"Ali Akoglu","affiliation":["The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Akoglu","id":"37322602900"},{"name":"H.

As heterogeneous computing becomes prevalent, mapping applications on to multiple processing elements (PEs) proves to be non-trivial. Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm is an already existing scheduler that aims to minimize the total execution time of an application. The paradigm of HEFT is such that it accepts an acyclic task graph as input at run-time and assigns/schedules the precompiled atomic tasks to PEs. HEFT stands out among many such schedulers not only in terms of producing shorter schedules but also in terms of its own short execution time. However, in real-time applications, the lower the latency, the better it is. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the only work that implements HEFT in hardware (on FPGA) further lowering its latency from milliseconds to as much as less than a microsecond. Porting HEFT to hardware has been challenging as data dependencies limit the amount of parallelism. Design of an efficient memory access pattern as well as an \u201cincremental sorter\u201d were key enablers in reducing the latency of the hardware implementation. We also integrated our FPGA-HEFT into an ARM-based SoC and validated its functionality using a realistic workload.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based Minimal Latency HEFT Scheduler for Heterogeneous Computing","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","doi":"10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558926","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9558874/9558875/09558926.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based Minimal Latency HEFT Scheduler for Heterogeneous Computing","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9558926/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","publicationDate":"15 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based Minimal Latency HEFT Scheduler for Heterogeneous Computing","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1336-FPGAbased-Minimal-Aliyev.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048166S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9558874","isNumber":"9558875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9558874","xplore-issue":"9558875","articleId":"9558926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9558982,"authors":[{"name":"Furkan Eren","affiliation":["Fatih Sultan Mehmet Vakif University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Furkan","lastName":"Eren","id":"37088990185"},{"name":"Zeynep G\u00fcndo\u011far","affiliation":["Fatih Sultan Mehmet Vakif University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Zeynep","lastName":"G\u00fcndo\u011far","id":"37086450068"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2908-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-2907-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2909-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2521-1641"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0592"}],"articleNumber":"9558982","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Medical images are crucial data sources for diseases that can not be diagnosed easily. X-rays, one of the medical images, have high resolution. Processing high-resolution images leads to a few problems such as difficulties in data storage, computational load, and the time required to process high-dimensional data. It is vital to be able to diagnose diseases fast and accurately. In this study, a data set consisting of lung X-rays of patients with and without COVID-19 symptoms was taken into consideration. Disease diagnosis from these images can be summarized in two steps as preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing step covers the feature extraction process and for this the recently developed decomposition-based method, Tridiagonal Matrix Enhanced Multivariance Products Representation (TMEMPR), is proposed as a feature extraction method. The classification of images is the second step where the methods of Random Forests and Support Vector Machines are applied. Also, the X-ray images have been reduced by 99,9% with TMEMPR and with several state-of-the-art feature extraction methods such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The results are examined with regard to different feature extraction methods and it is observed that a higher accuracy rate is achieved when the TMEMPR method is used.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9558874/9558875/09558982.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","doi":"10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Covid-19 X-ray Images Using Tridiagonal Matrix Enhanced Multivariance Products Representation (TMEMPR)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Support vector machines","Memory","X-rays","Transforms","Feature extraction","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Covid-19","Feature Extraction","Classification","Tridiagonal Matrix Enhanced Multivariance Products Representation","Matrix Decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Covid-19 X-ray Images Using Tridiagonal Matrix Enhanced Multivariance Products Representation (TMEMPR)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9558982/","publicationDate":"15 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Covid-19 X-ray Images Using Tridiagonal Matrix Enhanced Multivariance Products Representation (TMEMPR)","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1330-Classification-Covid-Eren.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078619S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9558874","isNumber":"9558875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9558874","xplore-issue":"9558875","articleId":"9558982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9558983,"authors":[{"name":"O\u011fuz Emre Kural","affiliation":["Ondokuz May\u0131s University, Samsun, Turkey"],"firstName":"O\u011fuz Emre","lastName":"Kural","id":"37086007104"},{"name":"Durmu\u015f \u00d6zkan \u015eahin","affiliation":["Ondokuz May\u0131s University, Samsun, Turkey"],"firstName":"Durmu\u015f \u00d6zkan","lastName":"\u015eahin","id":"37086375804"},{"name":"Sedat Akleylek","affiliation":["Ondokuz May\u0131s University, Samsun, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sedat","lastName":"Akleylek","id":"38228720200"},{"name":"Erdal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7","affiliation":["Ondokuz May\u0131s University, Samsun, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7","id":"37569845400"},{"name":"Murat \u00d6m\u00fcral","affiliation":["R\u00f6nesans Holding A.,S., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"\u00d6m\u00fcral","id":"37088993237"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2908-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-2907-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2909-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2521-1641"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0592"}],"articleNumber":"9558983","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Apk2Img4AndMal: Android Malware Detection Framework Based on Convolutional Neural Network","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9558874/9558875/09558983.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"734","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9558875","doi":"10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558983","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Computer science","Gray-scale","Feature extraction","Malware","Convolutional neural networks","Image classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","convolutional neural network","android malware","malware image","android malware detection","APK to image."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9558983","abstract":"In this study, the Apk2Img4AndMal framework, which provides information about the application without the need for static or dynamic attributes, is recommended.

Different than the related studies, our contribution is a detailed and up-to-date roadmap for simulator selection for researchers working in different layers of nanonetwork applications such as channel modeling, antenna design, modulation methods, medium access control (MAC) protocols, and routing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9558990/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"15 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9558990/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Evaluation of Internet of Nano-Things Simulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evaluation of Internet of Nano-Things Simulators","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1458-Evaluation-Internet-Sahin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11111S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9558874","isNumber":"9558875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9558874","xplore-issue":"9558875","articleId":"9558990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9559049,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelhak Hidouri","affiliation":["Hatem Bettaher IResCoMath Lab, University of Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdelhak","lastName":"Hidouri","id":"37088991371"},{"name":"Mohamed Hadded","affiliation":["Institut VEDECOM, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hadded","id":"37085516502"},{"name":"Nasreddine Hajlaoui","affiliation":["Hatem Bettahar IResCoMath Lab, University of Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nasreddine","lastName":"Hajlaoui","id":"38469132000"},{"name":"Haifa Touati","affiliation":["Hatem Bettahar IResCoMath Lab, University of Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Haifa","lastName":"Touati","id":"37873425500"},{"name":"Paul Muhlethaler","affiliation":["INRIA Paris, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Muhlethaler","id":"37296445000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2456-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1847-358X"}],"articleNumber":"9559049","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Pollution","Data security","Computer architecture","Software","Telecommunications","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Named Data Networks","Security","Cache pollution attack","NDNSim"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559049","abstract":"Named Data Networking (NDN), one of the most suitable candidates for the future Internet architecture, allows all network nodes to have a local cache that is used to serve incoming content requests. Content caching is an essential component in NDN: content is cached in routers and used for future requests in order to reduce bandwidth consumption and improve data delivery speed. Moreover, NDN introduces new self-certifying contents features that obviously improve data security and make NDN a secured-by-design architecture able to support an efficient and secure content distribution at a global scale. However, basic NDN security mechanisms, such as signatures and encryption, are not sufficient to ensure security in these networks. Indeed, the availability of the Data in several caches in the network allows malicious nodes to perform attacks that are relatively easy to implement and very effective. Such attacks include Cache Pollution Attacks (CPA), Cache Privacy Attacks, Content Poisoning Attacks and Interest Flooding Attacks. In this paper, we identify the different attack models that can disrupt the NDN operation. We conducted several simulations on NDNSim to assess the impact of the Cache Pollution Attack on the performance of a Named Data Network. More precisely, we implemented different attack scenarios and analyzed their impact in terms of cache hit ratio, data retrieval delay and hit damage ratio.","doi":"10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559049","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9559036/9559048/09559049.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9559048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache Pollution Attacks in the NDN Architecture: Impact and Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Cache Pollution Attacks in the NDN Architecture: Impact and Analysis","htmlLink":"/document/9559049/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"23 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache Pollution Attacks in the NDN Architecture: Impact and Analysis","confLoc":"Split, Hvar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"CachePollutionAttacksintheNDNArchitecture.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073624S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9559036","isNumber":"9559048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9559036","xplore-issue":"9559048","articleId":"9559049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9559063,"authors":[{"name":"Linda Chouikhi","affiliation":["SERCOM Laboratory, Polytechnic School, University of Carthage, La Marsa, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Chouikhi","id":"37088654479"},{"name":"Chaker Essid","affiliation":["SERCOM Laboratory, Polytechnic School, University of Carthage, La Marsa, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Chaker","lastName":"Essid","id":"37086329731"},{"name":"Hedi Sakli","affiliation":["MACS Research Laboratory RL16ES22 National Engineering School of Gabes, Gabes University, Montesson, France"],"firstName":"Hedi","lastName":"Sakli","id":"37646413300"},{"name":"Bassem Ben Salah","affiliation":["SERCOM Laboratory, Polytechnic School, University of Carthage, La Marsa, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Bassem","lastName":"Ben Salah","id":"37088993027"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2456-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1847-358X"}],"articleNumber":"9559063","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual coupling","5G mobile communication","Split ring resonators","Microstrip antennas","Metamaterials","Software","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","Isolation","MIMO antenna","Mm Wave","SRR","Mutual coupling","Metamaterial","5G"]}],"abstract":"In this work, a simple MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) antenna with a partial ground plane is proposed for the band 3.4-3.8 GHz. Due to the placement of the antennas close to each other, a mutual coupling is obtained which induces changes in the intrinsic parameters of the antennas. It is therefore necessary to increase the isolation level between the antennas to have an efficient MIMO system operation. The insertion of 3 SRRs (Split Ring Resonator) cells between the two antennas is in order to reduce this mutual coupling between the antennas. So, a high isolation of more than 18 dB is achieved by SRRs).

If only PA linearization is considered, the high crest factor (PAPR) of the amplified signal causes saturation when input power is higher than the PA saturation power. If only PAPR reduction is implemented alone, PA non-linearities will degrade the signal at low input backoff (IBO). It is necessary to combine the two methods in order to operate the PA with low IBO while having low in band and out of band degradations. Hybrid methods modify both the architecture of the PA for linearization purposes and the PAPR reduction of the amplified signals. In this paper two hybrid methods: Iterative Dichotomy PAPR Reduction (IDP) and Linear amplification using nonlinear components (LINC) are compared in terms of energy efficiency and implementation complexity. Two real PA models with different output saturation powers are used (45dBm and 15dBm) and the power dedicated to the algorithm implementations are quantified using an FPGA implementation. Simulation results shows that the IDP method outperforms the LINC one in terms of energy efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of IDP and LINC Methods Using Real Power Amplifiers","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","doi":"10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559085","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9559036/9559048/09559085.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9559048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of IDP and LINC Methods Using Real Power Amplifiers","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9559085/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","publicationDate":"23 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of IDP and LINC Methods Using Real Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Split, Hvar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"HardwareImplementationofIDPandLINCMethods.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063553S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9559036","isNumber":"9559048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9559036","xplore-issue":"9559048","articleId":"9559085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9559099,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Bili\u0161kov","affiliation":["Codeasy, Split, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Bili\u0161kov","id":"37088991303"},{"name":"Matko \u0160ari\u0107","affiliation":["University of Split, Split, Croatia"],"firstName":"Matko","lastName":"\u0160ari\u0107","id":"37086926132"},{"name":"Mladen Russo","affiliation":["University of Split, Split, Croatia"],"firstName":"Mladen","lastName":"Russo","id":"37290097400"},{"name":"Maja Stella","affiliation":["University of Split, Split, Croatia"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Stella","id":"37703538600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2456-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1847-358X"}],"articleNumber":"9559099","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Motion segmentation","Surveillance","Computer architecture","Feature extraction","Software","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["object detection","CNN","U-Net","football player detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559099","abstract":"People detection in image and video is challenging problem that has great importance in different applications such as surveillance systems, autonomous driving systems, sports video analysis etc. Player detection task, as a subproblem of people detection, is one of the fundamental steps in football video analysis.

The NOMA technique is used together with different techniques to provide solutions to various problems. As one of these techniques, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique creates a combination with NOMA and used to meet the high spectral efficiency expected from 5G. On the other hand, having multiple antennas in this combination technique means that multiple radio frequencies (RF) circuit chain, which results in higher cost and system complications. Antenna selection algorithms have been developed to overcome this problem. In this work, antenna selection is performed by using max-max-max algorithms. Bit error rate (BER) performances have been evaluated by allocating different power to users at different distances. As a result of the evaluations, it has been observed that the distance changed the channel coefficient and the changing channel coefficient affected the antenna selection and caused a difference in the BER values.","doi":"10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559104","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9559036/9559048/09559104.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9559048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter Receiver Antenna Selection for MIMO-NOMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559104/","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter Receiver Antenna Selection for MIMO-NOMA System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9559104/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter Receiver Antenna Selection for MIMO-NOMA System","confLoc":"Split, Hvar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"TransmitterReceiverAntennaSelectionforMIM.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043284S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9559036","isNumber":"9559048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9559036","xplore-issue":"9559048","articleId":"9559104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9559117,"authors":[{"name":"Zainab Sh.

Massive MIMO-OFDM-based cellular communication has recently become popular in a variety of realtime applications. However, as the need for high-quality communication grew, so did the number of users, posing various problems. In this article, we presented a comprehensive review study about Massive MIMO-OFDM based communication techniques and development. We mainly focus on essential parameters of Massive MIMO-OFDM, which play an essential role in 5G communication such as PAPR, precoding, channel estimation, and error-correcting codes. The paper shows results on the energy efficiency for a wireless (MIMO) link operating at millimeter-wave frequencies (mmWave) in a typical 5G scenario, showing the impact of the above essential parameters on the 5G performance. This comprehensive review and comparison will research 5G development and applications to adopt the proper techniques to achieve their demand.","doi":"10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559117","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9559036/9559048/09559117.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9559048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO-OFDM Performance Enhancement on 5G","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559117/","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO-OFDM Performance Enhancement on 5G","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9559117/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO-OFDM Performance Enhancement on 5G","confLoc":"Split, Hvar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"MassiveMIMOOFDMPerformanceEnhancementon5G.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054946S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9559036","isNumber":"9559048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9559036","xplore-issue":"9559048","articleId":"9559117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9559186,"authors":[{"name":"Ruijie He","affiliation":["EMC Laboratory, Missouri University of Sicence and Technology, Rolla, Missouri"],"firstName":"Ruijie","lastName":"He","id":"37085823590"},{"name":"Xu Wang","affiliation":["EMC Laboratory, Missouri University of Sicence and Technology, Rolla, Missouri"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085776651"},{"name":"Victor Khilkevich","affiliation":["EMC Laboratory, Missouri University of Sicence and Technology, Rolla, Missouri"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Khilkevich","id":"37888656600"},{"name":"Paul Dixon","affiliation":["Laird Performance Materials, Wakefield, Massachusetts"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Dixon","id":"38180485900"},{"name":"Onyekachi Eloagu","affiliation":["Laird Performance Materials, Carlsbad, California"],"firstName":"Onyekachi","lastName":"Eloagu","id":"37088996440"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4888-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4889-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9559186","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559186","abstract":"At the post-design stage, applying absorber to transmission lines is a cost-effective and efficient way to improve the EMI behavior of a product.

In this paper, active-clamp flyback converters are taken as the example, the radiation model is developed, the double shielding technique is proposed to mitigate the radiated EMI effectively no matter the EMI filters are placed on the AC line or DC bus. The concept of this technique is explained in detail, the experiments are conducted to verify the analysis.

In practice, however, the MU-MIMO is sensitive to client mobility and is sometimes even harmful to the performance in networks with moving clients. In this paper, we identify that it is essential to optimize the MU-MIMO performance with moving clients by jointly selecting the sounding period, the number of spatial streams, and client grouping with the consideration of the client density of the network. We develop a data-driven model that estimates client throughput with the consideration of these parameters, as well as an algorithm that jointly determines the parameters for each client with low computational complexity. Using a commodity 802.11ax network, we experimentally demonstrate the significant impact of the key factors on MU-MIMO performance. Based on experimental data, we develop an emulation model to evaluate network performance with different client densities and mobility. Emulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms conventional schemes by over 20% in MU-MIMO networks with moving clients.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2021.3117596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/9644641/09559396.pdf","startPage":"4088","endPage":"4102","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2021.3117596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-Aware Optimizations for Downlink MU-MIMO in 802.11ax Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Motion-Aware Optimizations for Downlink MU-MIMO in 802.11ax Networks","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9559396/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559396/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004351","fundingName":"Cisco Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-Aware Optimizations for Downlink MU-MIMO in 802.11ax Networks","sourcePdf":"tnsm-su-3117596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086153S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"9644641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","xplore-issue":"9644641","articleId":"9559396","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9559458,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The CNN model is trained and applied to classify the security status of a sample system according to given node voltage magnitudes, and active and reactive power injections at network buses. Considering a set of performance metrics, the superior performance of the CNN alternative is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with a support vector machine classifier algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559458/","accessionNumber":"21201348","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9559458/","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","conferenceDate":"1-5 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural network based approach for static security assessment of power systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural network based approach for static security assessment of power systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"24-1570710719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07066S","chronDate":"1-5 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9559429","isNumber":"9559420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9559429","xplore-issue":"9559420","articleId":"9559458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TSI Enterprises","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9559467,"authors":[{"name":"Wenlei Ouyang","affiliation":["Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Wenlei","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37088988490"},{"name":"Meng Li","affiliation":["Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Li","id":"37088988495"},{"name":"Qiqi Liu","affiliation":["Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Qiqi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088988676"},{"name":"Jianchao Wang","affiliation":["Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088989074"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-68524-111-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2109-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-4824"}],"articleNumber":"9559467","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Cloud computing","Automation","Feature extraction","Software","Natural language processing","Computer security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","program diagnostics","security of data","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human society","computer products","application vulnerabilities","cloud computing","computing power","deep learning","binary program vulnerability detection","natural language processing","extracting function blocks","word2vec","corresponding feature vector","binary vulnerability mining","short-term memory network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Binary File","Vulnerability Mining","Word Vector","LSTM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559467","abstract":"With the development of human society, the number of software and other computer products began to increase sharply, but the increase in the number of software also brought the increase of the application vulnerabilities behind.

This paper presents a modernized algorithm for controlling the geometry of half-cylinders for the proposed vision system. The proposed theories and methods are tested on the basis of the developed virtual environment which was made similar to real technological process. In real experiments, there is a measurement uncertainty, which complicates the comparison of methods with each other. In addition, under real conditions it is difficult or impossible to estimate values of certain parameters. The virtual environment, in turn, eliminates these problems. The vision system proposed in this paper contains fewer electrical components and mechanical connections than a standard measuring system, which increases the reliability of the system. Moreover, with the proposed system, the cross-section of the half-cylinder can be scanned continuously, therefore, the energy parameters of the installation increase and the time of the technological process decreases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Ural Conference on Electrical Power Engineering (UralCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9559428/9559415/09559553.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"586","publicationTitle":"2021 International Ural Conference on Electrical Power Engineering (UralCon)","doi":"10.1109/UralCon52005.2021.9559553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UralCon52005.2021.9559553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9559415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring the Geometry of Half-Cylinders in a Pipe Production Line on a Basis of an Omnidirectional Vision System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Machine vision","Measurement uncertainty","Energy measurement","Virtual environments","Process control","Control systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["omnidirectional camera","structured light","semantic data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Measuring the Geometry of Half-Cylinders in a Pipe Production Line on a Basis of an Omnidirectional Vision System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9559553/","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring the Geometry of Half-Cylinders in a Pipe Production Line on a Basis of an Omnidirectional Vision System","confLoc":"Magnitogorsk, Russian Federation","sourcePdf":"10059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053126S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9559428","isNumber":"9559415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9559428","xplore-issue":"9559415","articleId":"9559553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":9559614,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Ivanov","affiliation":["Math and Hardware Information System Chair, Chuvash State University, Cheboksary, Russia"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Ivanov","id":"37088992316"},{"name":"Maxim Nikandrov","affiliation":["LLC \u00abiGrids\u00bb ltd, Cheboksary, Russia"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Nikandrov","id":"37087054342"},{"name":"Aleksandr Lariukhin","affiliation":["LLC \u00abiGrids\u00bb ltd, Cheboksary, Russia"],"firstName":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Lariukhin","id":"37088993752"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1966-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3000-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-0797"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0789"}],"articleNumber":"9559614","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"abstract":"To control information exchange in the digital substation, it is possible to use machine learning methods, the artificial neural networks (ANN), in particular. The ANN training, as a multifactor optimization problem, and its testing make it possible to detect anomalies in information flows and operating modes of the secondary equipment in electric power industries. Using examples for neuro-modeling of overcurrent protection operation mode in a three-phase network, the paper shows the features of a neural network functioning based on an elementary perceptron and estimates the accuracy of the corresponding models. The structure of the simplest neural network is optimized and accuracy evaluation of the neural network algorithm is presented depending on the training sample volume (from 1000 to 50000 records) and the number of training epochs. It was found that neuromodelling makes it possible to evaluate with a high accuracy the value for overcurrent protection adequate trip setting. The deviation range of current values in each phase, when the neural network makes errors in data recognition, does not exceed one percent of the threshold value., The neural network in this range is very \"sensitive\" to changes in input signals. It is shown that if emergency modes with adequate actuation of relay protection are considered as standard secondary equipment operation modes, then neuromodeling and corresponding signal processing make it possible to detect anomalies in the standard secondary equipment operation modes in the electric power system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Ural Conference on Electrical Power Engineering (UralCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9559428/9559415/09559614.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","publicationTitle":"2021 International Ural Conference on Electrical Power Engineering (UralCon)","doi":"10.1109/UralCon52005.2021.9559614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UralCon52005.2021.9559614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9559415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuro Algorithm Accuracy Evaluation for The Anomalies Detecting in Overcurrent Protection Operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Substations","Signal processing algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Signal processing","Task analysis","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network modeling","overcurrent protection","anomalies in operation modes","elementary perceptron","three-phase electrical network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Neuro Algorithm Accuracy Evaluation for The Anomalies Detecting in Overcurrent Protection Operation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9559614/","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuro Algorithm Accuracy Evaluation for The Anomalies Detecting in Overcurrent Protection Operation","confLoc":"Magnitogorsk, Russian Federation","sourcePdf":"10315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077504S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9559428","isNumber":"9559415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9559428","xplore-issue":"9559415","articleId":"9559614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9559619,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandr Slavutskiy","affiliation":["Separate Division of LLC \"Unitel Engineering\", Cheboksary, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexandr","lastName":"Slavutskiy","id":"37088989783"},{"name":"Leonid Slavutskii","affiliation":["Chuvash State University, Cheboksary, Russia"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Slavutskii","id":"37087045776"},{"name":"Elena Slavutskaya","affiliation":["Chuvash State Pedogogical University, Cheboksary, Russia"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Slavutskaya","id":"37088521089"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1966-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3000-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-0797"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0789"}],"articleNumber":"9559619","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559619","abstract":"Artificial neural networks, after their training and testing, allow, in the \"if then\" mode, to process signals in real time.

If a traditional reconfigurable cyclic shifter can only shift one input of variable size at a time, a traditional QC-LDPC decoder can only decode one codeword at a time as well. Part of the circuitry of the traditional QC-LDPC decoder inevitably stays in idle during the decoding process if the length (or the lifting parameter) of a codeword is not the maximum, resulting in low hardware efficiency. A segmented reconfigurable cyclic shifter is proposed in this paper, which can be divided into multiple segments of different sizes. Each segment can perform a cyclic shift of an input of different sizes and of different shift values independently. Furthermore, a methodology is proposed to upgrade any state-of-the-art QC-LDPC decoder to a segmented QC-LDPC decoder, by using the proposed segmented shifter. The upgraded segmented QC-LDPC decoder is able to parallelly decode multiple codewords (or inputs) of different lengths at a time. A test chip of the proposed segmented QC-LDPC decoder with the proposed segmented reconfigurable cyclic shifter has been fabricated in a 0.18-\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n CMOS technology to demonstrate the feature of parallelly decoding multiple codewords. The performance analysis shows that when the number of small codewords is increased from 0 to 100000 per second, the throughput of the traditional QC-LDPC decoder drops from 844.80 Mbps to 4.40 Mbps, while the QC-LDPC decoder with the proposed segmented shifter only slightly drops to 814.01 Mbps. By applying the segmented QC-LDPC decoder in 5G base stations, the base stations are enabled to support more low-traffic users.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3114395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9684154/09559711.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9684154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3114395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"A High-Efficiency Segmented Reconfigurable Cyclic Shifter for 5G QC-LDPC Decoder","volume":"69","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9559711/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559711/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62074005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010877","fundingName":"Shenzhen Municipal Scientific Program","grantNumber":"KQJSCX20180323174729052"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Efficiency Segmented Reconfigurable Cyclic Shifter for 5G QC-LDPC Decoder","sourcePdf":"tcsi-jiao-3114395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07752S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9684154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9684154","articleId":"9559711","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9559713,"authors":[{"name":"Qingyue Chen","affiliation":["National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9559713/chen-3117517-small.gif","p":["Qingyue Chen was born in Qingdao, China.

The robustness against low SNR is achieved by concurrently integrating magnitude normalization and noise feature filtering using a filtering block built with one batch normalization (BN) layer and two bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layers. Moreover, unlike existing deep neural network-based DSR techniques (DNN-DSR), which failed to effectively take into account the memory effects of radio-frequency power amplifiers (RF-PAs) in the model design, the proposed BiLSTM-DSR technique can extracts the sequential characteristics of the adjacent in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) samples, and hence can obtain superior memory effects compensation compared with the DNN-DSR technique. Experimental validation results of the proposed BiLSTM-DSR with a 100 MHz bandwidth OFDM signal demonstrate an excellent performance of 11.83 dB and 9.4% improvement for adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and error vector magnitude (EVM), respectively. BiLSTM-DSR also outperforms the existing DNN-DSR technique in terms of the ACPR and EVM by 2.4 dB and 0.9%, which provides a promising solution for developing deep learning-assisted receivers for high-throughput LEO satellite networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Digital Signal Recovery for LEO Satellite Communications Subject to High SNR Variation and Transmitter Memory Effects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117517","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09559713.pdf","startPage":"135803","endPage":"135815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Robust Digital Signal Recovery for LEO Satellite Communications Subject to High SNR Variation and Transmitter Memory Effects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9559713/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Digital Signal Recovery for LEO Satellite Communications Subject to High SNR Variation and Transmitter Memory Effects","sourcePdf":"access-chen-3117517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145487S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9559713","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9559714,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hyo Kang","affiliation":["SK Hynix, Icheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9664397/9559714/kang-3114205-small.gif","p":["Ji-Hyo Kang (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, South Korea, in 2011.","He developed LCD and OLED display driver integrated circuits (ICs).

This article proposes a GDDR6 dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a half-rate clocking architecture and optimized receiver and transmitter to improve high-speed operation. Furthermore, this article adopts a staggered PAD using the redistribution layer (RDL) to reduce the distance to four PADs; it enables the mitigation of bandwidth limitation of half-rate clocking, a lower phase mismatch, and a reduced propagation delay. The proposed half-rate clocking-based GDDR6 DRAM achieves 24 Gb/s/pin on a 1.35-V DRAM process. Also, the power-supply-induced-jitter (PSIJ) value is improved from 9.97 to 3.22 ps, compared to a GDDR6 design using a quarter-rate clocking.

However, the generation of a multi-scroll/wing attractor is typically not induced by the memristor but depends on other nonlinear functions in the system, which does not take advantage of the unique features of the memristor for chaos-based applications. To address this issue, the present paper introduces a memristor coupling (MC) method to construct a novel memristive Sprott A system (MSAS) through coupling a flux-controlled memristor with multi-piecewise linear memductance into the chaotic Sprott A system. From theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the MSAS is shown to be able to generate any number of multi-type hidden attractors, including multi-one-scroll, multi-double-scroll and multi-double-wing hidden attractors. In addition, it has two kinds of multistabilities, that is, heterogeneous multistability and homogeneous multistability. Based on these unique properties, different numbers of coexisting heterogeneous hidden attractors and coexisting homogeneous hidden attractors are derived respectively by switching the memristor initial states. These interesting dynamical properties are comprehensively investigated using nonlinear analysis tools. Furthermore, hardware experiments are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the MSAS and the effectiveness of the MC method. Finally, a new pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is proposed to explore the practical applications of the MSAS. Performance evaluation results verify the high-quality randomness of the designed PRNG.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating Any Number of Diversified Hidden Attractors via Memristor Coupling","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3115662","endPage":"4956","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09559718.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"4945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3115662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559718","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Mathematical models","Couplings","Chaotic communication","Integrated circuit modeling","Hysteresis","Generators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristor","memristive Sprott A system","multi-scroll/wing hidden attractor","heterogeneous/homogeneous multistability","pseudo-random number generator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generating Any Number of Diversified Hidden Attractors via Memristor Coupling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9559718/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61876209, 61936004 and U1913602"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating Any Number of Diversified Hidden Attractors via Memristor Coupling","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wang-3115662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101323S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9559718","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9559720,"authors":[{"name":"Chunlian Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9559720/wang-3113356-small.gif","p":["Chunlian Wang received the B.E. degree in automation from the Southwest University of Science and Technology, Sichuan, China, in 2018.

Different with the previous complex semantic segmentation-based estimator, the method extracts the feature vector through global average pooling of feature map and calculates the BFR directly through the fully connected layer. By removing decoder network, the number of weights, training time, and required GPU memory dramatically reduced. To train the proposed CNN, a new loss function, which is the sum of L1-norm between class activation map and ground truth inspection image and L1-norm of BFR error, is also designed. To validate the present method, fracture images of 1532, 79, and 158 DWTT specimens obtained from real industrial site were used for training, validation, and test, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated based on the number of test samples with an error of 5% or less divided by the total number of test samples, which is the measure used in real industrial application.

Several existing methods have detected various types of crowd abnormal behaviors by using spatial and temporal information got from videos. So far as real-time detection of anomalies is concerned, special attention must be given to reducing the model complexity that leads to computational and memory loads. This paper proposes a low computational cost approach to detect crowd anomalies. The proposed approach avoids the expensive optical flow calculations by adopting a pre-trained 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for motion information and implements a lighter form of the 2D CNN to achieve high recognition accuracy at low computational cost. Experiments on public datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the existing approaches in terms of detection accuracy alongside providing better performance in generating input frames.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09559976.pdf","startPage":"138283","endPage":"138295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Anomaly Detection in Crowd Videos Using Pre-Trained 2D Convolutional Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Feature extraction","Anomaly detection","Surveillance","Optical flow","Convolutional neural networks","Training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial-temporal CNN","anomaly detection","crowd abnormal behaviors","violence detection","crowd surveillance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Anomaly Detection in Crowd Videos Using Pre-Trained 2D Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9559976/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004686","fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research at King Faisal University through Nasher Track","grantNumber":"206054"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Anomaly Detection in Crowd Videos Using Pre-Trained 2D Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-mehmood-3118009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111781S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9559976","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9559985,"authors":[{"name":"Mehul Mahrishi","affiliation":["Swami Keshvanand Institute of Technology, Management & Gramothan, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9559985/mahri-3118048-small.gif","p":["Mehul Mahrishi (Senior Member, IEEE) is currently working as an Associate Professor with the Department of Information Technology, Swami Keshvanand Institute of Technology, Management and Gramothan, Jaipur, India.

There could be hundreds and thousands of videos on a single topic, with varying degrees of context, content, and depth of the topic. The literature claims that learners are nowadays less interested in viewing a complete video but prefers the topic of their interests. This develops the need for indexing of video lectures. Manual annotation or topic-wise indexing is not new in the case of videos. However, manual indexing is time-consuming due to the length of a typical video lecture and intricate storylines. Automatic indexing and annotation are, therefore, better and efficient solutions. This research aims to identify the need for automatic video indexing for better information retrieval and ease users navigating topics inside a video. The automatically identified topics are referred to as \u201cIndex Points.\u201d 137-layer YoloV4 Darknet Neural Network creates a custom object detector model. The model is trained on approximately 6000 video frames and then tested on a suite of 50 videos of around 20 hours of run time. Shot Boundary detection is performed using Structural Similarity fused with a Binary Search Pattern algorithm which outperformed the state-of-the-art SSIM technique by reducing the processing time to approximately 21% and providing around 96% accuracy. Generation of accurate index points in terms of true positives and false negatives is detected through precision, recall, and F1 score, which varies between 60\u201380% for every video. The results show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates a digital index with reasonable accuracy in topic detection.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118048","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09559985.pdf","startPage":"143378","endPage":"143391","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Index Point Detection and Extraction Framework Using Custom YoloV4 Darknet Object Detection Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Video Index Point Detection and Extraction Framework Using Custom YoloV4 Darknet Object Detection Model","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9559985/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Video Index Point Detection and Extraction Framework Using Custom YoloV4 Darknet Object Detection Model","sourcePdf":"access-bhatia-3118048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102461S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9559985","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9559989,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey Labintsev","affiliation":["Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation (Financial University), Moscow, Russia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9559989/labin-3118038-small.gif","p":["Andrey Labintsev received the Ph.D. degree, in August 2016.

The research was aimed at studying the automatic recognition of punches in karate using only linear acceleration sensors. Accelerometers were part of the Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), which were attached to the left and right wrist of the athlete. To develop a model of punches, highly qualified athletes with 3\u20137 years of karate experience participated in the research. We analyzed the acceleration fields of various karate punches: Yun Tsuki, Mawashi Tsuki, Age of Tsuki, Uraken. We have proposed more straightforward approach to extracting features without calculating their statistical characteristics. To solve the classification problem, we have used various architectures of convolutional neural networks: multilayer perceptron, 1- and 2-dimension Convolution Networks. Since the recognition of punches was carried out in the conditions of a shadow fight, in addition to the recognition of punches, another output parameter was introduced \u2013 movement without punches. Studies have shown a high level of punch recognition based on the developed models. The multi-class accuracy value is 0.96, and the average F1 value is 0.97 for five different punch classes. Thus, the proposed approach is more suitable for practical implementation in automatic learning systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118038","startPage":"138106","endPage":"138119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09559989.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition Punches in Karate Using Acceleration Sensors and Convolution Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559989/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recognition Punches in Karate Using Acceleration Sensors and Convolution Neural Networks","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9559989/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21176117","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Recognition Punches in Karate Using Acceleration Sensors and Convolution Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-bocharov-3118038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106808S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9559989","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9559992,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Cao","affiliation":["Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Yanqi Lake Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Meng Cao received the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2020.

To decrease Base Station (BS) interaction, intra-cell communication between local devices, known as Device-to-Device, is utilized for distributed data caching. Nevertheless, due to the continuous departure of existing nodes and the arrival of newcomers, the missing cached data may lead to permanent data loss. In this study, we propose and analyze a class of Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes for distributed data caching in cellular networks. Contrary to traditional distributed storage, a novel repair algorithm for LDPC codes is proposed which is designed to exploit the minimal direct BS communication. To assess the versatility of LDPC codes and establish performance comparisons to classic coding techniques, novel theoretical and experimental evaluations are derived. Essentially, the theoretical/numerical results for repair bandwidth cost in presence of BS are presented in a distributed caching setting. Accordingly, when the gap between the cost of downloading a symbol from BS and from other local network nodes is not dramatically high, we demonstrate that LDPC codes can be considered as a viable fault-tolerance alternative in cellular systems with caching capabilities for both low and high code rates.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3118027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09559994.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3118027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data Repair-Efficient Fault Tolerance for Cellular Networks Using LDPC Codes","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9559994/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559994/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TUBITAK","grantNumber":"119E235"},{"fundingName":"Pamukkale University Scientific Research Projects Department","grantNumber":"2018FEBE009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Repair-Efficient Fault Tolerance for Cellular Networks Using LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-haytaoglu-3118027-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102496S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9559994","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9559995,"authors":[{"name":"Walaa Alkhader","affiliation":["Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9559995/alkha-3118085-small.gif","p":["Walaa Alkhader received the master\u2019s degree in engineering systems and management from Masdar Institute, UAE, in 2017.

We develop Ethereum smart contracts to govern and track transactions in a decentralized, transparent, traceable, auditable, trustworthy, and secure manner. This allows overcoming certain issues hindering the transition towards decentralized digital manufacturing and supply, including trusted traceability, attestations, certifications, and secured intellectual property (IP) rights. We incorporate the decentralized storage of the InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) into the Ethereum blockchain to store and fetch Internet of things (IoT)-based devices records and additional manufacturing and supply details. We present the system architecture and algorithms along with their full implementation and testing details. Furthermore, we present cost and security analyses to show that the proposed solution is cost-efficient and resilient against well-known vulnerabilities and security attacks.

The probability of success of each attempted communication is a function of the channel used. This function is unknown to the scheduler. The metric of interest is the Age-of-Information (AoI), formally defined as the time elapsed since the destination received the recent most update from the source. We model our scheduling problem as a variant of the multi-arm bandit problem with communication channels as arms. We characterize a lower bound on the AoI regret achievable by any policy and characterize the performance of UCB, Thompson Sampling, and their variants. Our analytical results show that UCB and Thompson sampling are order-optimal for AoI bandits. In addition, we propose novel policies which, unlike UCB and Thompson Sampling, use the current AoI to make scheduling decisions. Via simulations, we show the proposed AoI-aware policies outperform existing AoI-agnostic policies.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3118037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3118037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"87","endPage":"100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09559999.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559999","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Communication channels","Measurement","Upper bound","Schedules","Time-varying systems","Time measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scheduling algorithms","internet-of-things (IOT)","multi-armed bandit (MAB)","age-of-information (AOI)","sensors","communication channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Regret of Age-of-Information Bandits","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9559999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9559999/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regret of Age-of-Information Bandits","sourcePdf":"tcomm-fatale-3118037-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087111S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9559999","onlineDate":"05 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"}]
