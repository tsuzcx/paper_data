The underwater acoustic channel is considered to be one of the most complicated channels because it suffers from more serious multipath effect, fewer available bandwidths and quite complex noise. Since the signals experience a serious distortion after being transmitted through the underwater acoustic channel, the underwater acoustic communication experiences a high bit error rate (BER). To solve this problem, carrier waveform inter-displacement (CWID) modulation is proposed. It has been proved that CWID modulation is an effective method to decrease BER. The linear frequency modulation (LFM) carrier-waves are used in CWID modulation. The performance of the communication using CWID modulation is sensitive to the change of the frequency band of LFM carrier-waves. The immune particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is introduced to search for the optimal frequency band of the LFM carrier-waves, due to its excellent performance in solving complicated optimization problems. The multi-objective and multi-peak optimization nature of the IPSO gives a suitable description of the relationship between the upper band and the lower band of the LFM carrier-waves. Simulations verify the improved performance and effectiveness of the optimization method.","doi":"10.1109/JSEE.2015.00052","startPage":"450","endPage":"456","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEE.2015.00052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7169874","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7169874/07170003.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Immune particle swarm optimization of linear frequency modulation in acoustic communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7170003/","displayDocTitle":"Immune particle swarm optimization of linear frequency modulation in acoustic communication","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Immune particle swarm optimization of linear frequency modulation in acoustic communication","sourcePdf":"450456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034243S","chronDate":"June  2015","isNumber":"7169874","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7170003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7170035,"authors":[{"name":"Emmy-Charlotte F\u00f6rster","affiliation":["Computer Graphics Lab, Braunschweig, TU, Germany"],"firstName":"Emmy-Charlotte","lastName":"F\u00f6rster","id":"37085404110"},{"name":"Thomas L\u00f6we","affiliation":["Computer Graphics Lab, Braunschweig, TU, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"L\u00f6we","id":"38028705600"},{"name":"Stephan Wenger","affiliation":["Computer Graphics Lab, Braunschweig, TU, Germany","Google Switzerland, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Wenger","id":"37298757500"},{"name":"Marcus Magnor","affiliation":["Computer Graphics Lab, Braunschweig, TU, Germany","Dept.

However, the image quality of US imaging is severely affected by the presence of speckle noise during the acquisition process. It is essential to achieve speckle-free high resolution US imaging for better clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a speckle and blur reduction algorithm for US imaging based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here, speckle noise is modelled as a multiplicative noise following a Rayleigh distribution, whereas blur is modelled as a Gaussian blur function. The noise and blur variances are estimated by a cascade-forward back propagation (CFBP) neural network using a set of intensity and wavelet features of the US image. The estimated noise and blur variances are then used for speckle reduction by solving the inverse Rayleigh function, and for de-blurring, using the Lucy-Richardson algorithm. The proposed approach gives improved results for both qualitative and quantitative measures.","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2015.7170056","startPage":"105","endPage":"108","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158224/7170026/07170056.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2015.7170056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speckle reduction and deblurring of ultrasound images using artificial neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Optical filters","Biomedical imaging","Noise","Image resolution","Image restoration","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","biomedical ultrasonics","Gaussian processes","image denoising","image restoration","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speckle reduction","ultrasound image deblurring","artificial neural network","noninvasive real-time tool","acquisition process","speckle noise","speckle-free high resolution US imaging","blur reduction","multiplicative noise","Rayleigh distribution","Gaussian blur function","cascade-forward back propagation neural network","CFBP","blur variances","noise variances","inverse Rayleigh function","Lucy-Richardson algorithm","qualitative measures","quantitative measures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasound imaging","speckle noise","blur","artificial neural network","complex wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7170056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Speckle reduction and deblurring of ultrasound images using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7170056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15329414","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speckle reduction and deblurring of ultrasound images using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061665S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158224","isNumber":"7170026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158224","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7170026","articleId":"7170056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7170062,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Sanchez","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Sanchez","id":"37394525300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7783-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7170062","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Image coding","Decoding","Video coding","Interpolation","Transforms","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","edge detection","gradient methods","image sequences","multimedia computing","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample-based edge prediction","lossless screen content coding","HEVC","screen content sequences","multimedia services","video compression","video coding","SAP-G","sample-based angular intra-prediction","gradient-based edge prediction","PLANAR mode"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7170062","abstract":"The amount of generated screen content sequences has recently increased due to the high popularity of multimedia services such as videoconferencing and cloud video gaming.

Specifically, the paper proposes SAP-G (sample-based angular intra-prediction with gradient-based edge prediction), which is a DPCM-based intra-prediction method that combines angular prediction with a low-complexity edge predictor and a DPCM-based DC predictor. The edge predictor, which replaces the current PLANAR mode, is based on the computation of gradients along four main directions using the adjacent pixels to the pixel to be predicted. Simulation results show that SAP-G can attain average bit-rate reductions of 15.44% over current HEVC intra-prediction for a variety of screen content sequences.

In order to construct a GTT (i) a design matrix leading to a class of transforms is defined, then (ii) a constrained optimization framework is employed to learn graphs based on given graph templates structuring a priori known information. Our experimental results show that some instances of the proposed GTTs can closely achieve the rate-distortion performance of KLT with significantly less complexity.","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2015.7170075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2015.7170075","startPage":"199","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158224/7170026/07170075.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GTT: Graph template transforms with applications to image coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"GTT: Graph template transforms with applications to image coding","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7170075/","accessionNumber":"15329429","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7170075/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GTT: Graph template transforms with applications to image coding","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070857S","chronDate":"May 31 2015-June 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158224","isNumber":"7170026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158224","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7170026","articleId":"7170075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7170088,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085364256"},{"name":"Xiangmin Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangmin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37653884500"},{"name":"Xiaobo Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085349871"},{"name":"Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bingo Wing-Kuen","lastName":"Ling","id":"37283336500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7783-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7170088","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Very large scale integration","Field programmable gate arrays","Gesture recognition","Computer architecture","Human computer interaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","gesture recognition","human computer interaction","image colour analysis","image segmentation","object detection","parallel architectures","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel VLSI architecture","very large scale integration","contactless HCI system","human computer interaction","field programmable gate array","FPGA","hand gesture recognition system","Haar feature Adaboost detector","skin color segmentation","frame subtraction background modeling","judgment strategy","video processing","Altera Stratix IV board","parallelism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["contactless human computer interaction","parallel architecture","FPGA","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based 2-dimentional hand gesture recognition system using Haar feature Adaboost detector, skin color segmentation, and frame subtraction background modeling.

Traveling wave, which is a kind of non-stationary signal with mutation, spreads along the line when HVDC transmission line fault happens. The feature of the traveling wave with mutation contains the fault time, fault location. By analyzing the traveling wave, accurate fault location can be derived. In this paper, an HVDC transmission line fault localization algorithm based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network with wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is proposed. For the sake of simplicity, the proposed algorithm is shorted for WPD-RBF in the rest of this paper. By using WPD algorithm, the feature of the traveling wave can be extracted from the voltage and current signals. These features are then used as the training input sample of RBF neural network to mapping to the line fault location. Simulation result indicates that, line fault position can be accurately localized by the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICSSSM.2015.7170211","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164207/7170133/07170211.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management (ICSSSM)","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management (ICSSSM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSSM.2015.7170211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HVDC transmission line fault localization base on RBF neural network with wavelet packet decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7170211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"HVDC transmission line fault localization base on RBF neural network with wavelet packet decomposition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15344100","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7170211/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HVDC transmission line fault localization base on RBF neural network with wavelet packet decomposition","confLoc":"Guangzhou","sourcePdf":"C092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050711S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164207","isNumber":"7170133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164207","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7170133","articleId":"7170211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7170318,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Mengxu","affiliation":["UESTC, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, China","Chengdu Aeronautic Polytechnic, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Fang Mengxu","id":"37085643539"},{"name":"Tang Bin","affiliation":["UESTC, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, China","The Innovation Base of School-Enterprise Cooperation Aviation Electronic Technology in Sichuan, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Tang Bin","id":"37427904700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8328-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8327-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-1890"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-1904"}],"articleNumber":"7170318","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Hardware","Sociology","Statistics","Biological cells","Field programmable gate arrays","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","adaptive genetic algorithm","AGA","field programmable gate array","Altera Cyclone III series chips","Quartus II","fitness calculation module","control module","population initialization module","mutation module","crossover module","data channel selection module","random number generator module","memory module","Altera Cyclone III-EP3C40Q240C8N chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA)","FPGA","modular design","Altera Cyclone III-EP3C40Q240C8N"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is designed use Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based on modular design.

function of genetic algorithm for road traffic network division","abstract":"In this paper, the analysis of the fitness function of a genetic algorithm is discussed. This genetic algorithm is used by a method for the road traffic network division. The division of the road traffic network into a number of sub-networks is a part of necessary preparations for a distributed road traffic simulation. The fitness function consists of two parts reflecting two important issues of the road traffic network division - the load-balancing of the resulting sub-networks and the minimization of the number of divided traffic lanes. During the optimization and refactoring of the division method, it was discovered that the fitness function of the genetic algorithm is flawed, but gives better results than a new (repaired) fitness function. Hence, the working of the original fitness function was analyzed and the new fitness function was adjusted to give similar or better results than the original fitness function.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7170641/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15329497","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7170641/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of fitness function of genetic algorithm for road traffic network division","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of fitness function of genetic algorithm for road traffic network division","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"0040wf000175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047642S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158233","isNumber":"7170630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158233","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7170630","articleId":"7170641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7170646,"authors":[{"name":"Dumidu Wijayasekara","affiliation":["Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Dumidu","lastName":"Wijayasekara","id":"37888522700"},{"name":"Milos Manic","affiliation":["Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Manic","id":"37277736800"},{"name":"David Gertman","affiliation":["Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Idaho Falls, Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gertman","id":"37323121800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6936-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"}],"articleNumber":"7170646","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"abstract":"Dependency of the transport sector on fossil fuels is encouraging a significant amount of research in to improving fuel efficiency in vehicles. Three primary techniques are identified for vehicle fuel efficiency improvement: 1) vehicle technology improvements such as drivetrain improvements, 2) traffic infrastructure improvements such as traffic flow management and route selection, and 3) driver behavior changes such as acceleration and deceleration profiles. Out of the 3 techniques, driver behavior changing has the least implementation cost and is able to provide immediate results. Thus, this paper presents a fuel efficient driving behavior identification and feedback architecture that is specific to fleet vehicles. The presented method utilizes historical data from fleet drivers on specific routes and generates fuel optimal velocity profiles that do not affect travel time. The identified velocity profile is the prompted to the driver via a low-cost plug-and-play style un-obstructive display. The display uses an intuitive and easily understandable visualization to prompt drivers on fuel efficient velocity. The presented architecture was tested on the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) bus fleet in real-world driving conditions and was shown to be able to increase the fuel economy by 9% and 20% in two different driving scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Real-time systems","Fuel economy","Carbon dioxide","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","driver information systems","feedback","fuel economy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven fuel efficient driving behavior feedback","fleet vehicles","transport sector","fossil fuels","vehicle fuel efficiency improvement","vehicle technology improvement","drivetrain improvement","traffic infrastructure improvement","traffic flow management","route selection","driver behavior changes","acceleration profile","deceleration profile","driving behavior identification","feedback architecture","historical data","fuel optimal velocity profile","travel time","low-cost plug-and-play style unobstructive display","intuitive easily understandable visualization","fuel efficient velocity","Idaho National Laboratory","INL bus fleet","fuel economy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eco-driving","visualization","fuel efficiency","driver feedback","passive driver assistance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HSI.2015.7170646","publicationTitle":"2015 8th International Conference on Human System Interaction (HSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 8th International Conference on Human System Interaction (HSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158233/7170630/07170646.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2015.7170646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data driven fuel efficient driving behavior feedback for fleet vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7170646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data driven fuel efficient driving behavior feedback for fleet vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7170646/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7170646/","accessionNumber":"15329486","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data driven fuel efficient driving behavior feedback for fleet vehicles","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"0075wf002461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102665S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158233","isNumber":"7170630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158233","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7170630","articleId":"7170646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7170734,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Zong Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, IN"],"firstName":"Cheng-Zong","lastName":"Bai","id":"38469374200"},{"name":"Fabio Pasqualetti","affiliation":["Department Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pasqualetti","id":"37827824800"},{"name":"Vijay Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, IN"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37271178000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7170734","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":837},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7170734","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Detectors","Degradation","Cyber-physical systems","Random sequences","Estimation error","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic control systems","stochastic cyber-physical systems","single-input single-output plant","control law","Kalman filter estimation","estimation error","control performance","\u03b5-stealthiness notion","arbitrary detection algorithm","optimal attack strategy"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes a novel metric to characterize the resilience of stochastic cyber-physical systems to attacks and faults. We consider a single-input single-output plant regulated by a control law based on the estimate of a Kalman filter. We allow for the presence of an attacker able to hijack and replace the control signal. The objective of the attacker is to maximize the estimation error of the Kalman filter - which in turn quantifies the degradation of the control performance - by tampering with the control input, while remaining undetected. We introduce a notion of \u03b5-stealthiness to quantify the difficulty to detect an attack when an arbitrary detection algorithm is implemented by the controller. For a desired value of \u03b5-stealthiness, we quantify the largest estimation error that an attacker can induce, and we analytically characterize an optimal attack strategy. Because our bounds are independent of the detection mechanism implemented by the controller, our information-theoretic analysis characterizes fundamental security limitations of stochastic cyber-physical systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7170734","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07170734.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"200","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7170734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security in stochastic control systems: Fundamental limitations and performance bounds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Security in stochastic control systems: Fundamental limitations and performance bounds","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7170734/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15329710","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7170734/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in stochastic control systems: Fundamental limitations and performance bounds","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061686S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7170734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":7170736,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Cristofaro","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Cristofaro","id":"37403457700"},{"name":"Tor Arne Johansen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Tor Arne","lastName":"Johansen","id":"37285832400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7170736","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Aircraft","Atmospheric modeling","Ice","Observers","Actuators","Elevators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace components","aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","controllability","ice","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unknown input observer approach","icing detection","unmanned aerial vehicles","linearized longitudinal motion","control surfaces","wings","ice layer accretion","icing diagnosis filter design","vehicle controllability"]}],"abstract":"The accretion of ice layers on wings and control surfaces modifies the shape of the aircraft and, consequently, alters performance and controllability of the vehicle.

The model and the control algorithm are based on the traveling wave approach, which yields irrational and fractional order transfer functions in the frequency domain. In previously studied cases, with damping acting only at the boundaries and a conservative flexible media, it was shown that the wave form did not change between reflections. In the current case of distributed damping it is shown that the waves are distorted during motion. The closed loop algorithm is designed to eliminate the wave reflections at the control end. It extends the absolute vibration suppression (AVS) method to the irrational realm. The resulting controller is of fractional order and is implemented by appropriate approximations. The effectiveness of the control algorithm is demonstrated through rejection of external disturbances.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Vibrations","Force","Propagation","Mathematical model","Stability analysis","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","closed loop systems","damping","distributed parameter systems","flexible structures","transfer functions","wave equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional order control","flexible structure","wave equation damping","closed loop control","distributed damping","travelling wave approach","fractional order transfer function","absolute vibration suppression","AVS method","approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7170795","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07170795.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7170795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional order control of flexible structures governed by the damped wave equation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7170795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fractional order control of flexible structures governed by the damped wave equation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7170795/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7170795/","accessionNumber":"15330063","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional order control of flexible structures governed by the damped wave equation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065688S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7170795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7170863,"authors":[{"name":"Aramazd Muzhikyan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Systems and Management, Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Aramazd","lastName":"Muzhikyan","id":"37548020300"},{"name":"Amro M.

Reserves, scheduled in advance, compensate for forecast error, variability and transmission losses. However, as reserves are a costly commodity, their amount should be carefully assessed to prevent unnecessary expense.

While these assumptions have been made out of a level of engineering practicality, they may not be formally true given the numerical evidence.

An adaptive model by using two linearly parameterized neural networks (NNs) is designed to approximate the unknown internal dynamics of the nonlinear system with event sampled state vector. The estimated state vector and the dynamics from the adaptive model are subsequently used to design the control law. Novel NN weight update laws are proposed in the context of event-based availability of state vector wherein the NN weights are updated once at every aperiodic sampling instant unlike the traditional periodically sampled adaptive NN based control. A positive lower bound on the inter-sample times is shown. The boundedness of the NN weight estimation errors and system state vector are demonstrated by representing the event sampled closed-loop system as a nonlinear impulsive dynamical system and by using an adaptive trigger condition.

Regarding the issue, one of our previous works considered the scenario where the camera sensors with controllable orientations are distributed over the 3-D space to monitor 2-D environment. Then, we presented a visual coverage control scheme based on the gradient descent techniques on SO(3) in combination with an estimation process of the image density function describing the importance of each point over the image. In this paper, we build a testbed with four Pan-Tilt (PT) cameras and demonstrate the total process including the image acquisition, density estimation, gradient computation and camera physical motion. In particular, we show applicability of the presented scheme to a scenario of the human behavior monitoring. In addition, the density function is given in the form of a polynomial function in order to overcome the drawback of the above density estimation process that the magnitude of the motion at each pixel cannot be directly reflected to the resulting density. It is shown through experiments that the new density estimation method together with the new gradient outperforms the conventional method when the environment is rapidly changing.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7171047","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07171047.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7171047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","startPage":"2125","endPage":"2130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental study of gradient-based visual coverage control on SO(3) toward moving object/human monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7171047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental study of gradient-based visual coverage control on SO(3) toward moving object/human monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171047/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15343953","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7171047/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental study of gradient-based visual coverage control on SO(3) toward moving object/human monitoring","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06606S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7171047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7171058,"authors":[{"name":"Guosong Yang","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, U.S"],"lastName":"Guosong Yang","id":"37088016636"},{"name":"Daniel Liberzon","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, U.S"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Liberzon","id":"37270672500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7171058","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"abstract":"We study the problem of stabilizing a switched linear system with disturbance using sampled and quantized measurements of its state.

Since almost all real clocks exhibit drifts, this applies in particular to networks composed of several individual units, each of which being operated with its individual clock. In the present work, we investigate the effect of clock drifts in inverter-based microgrids. Via a suitable model that incorporates this phenomenon, we prove that clock inaccuracies hamper synchronization in microgrids, in which the individual inverters are operated with a fixed uniform constant electrical frequency. In addition, we show that the well-known frequency droop control renders stability of a lossless microgrid robust with respect to clock inaccuracies. This claim is established by using stability results reported previously by the authors for lossless inverter-based microgrids with ideal clocks. We also discuss the effect of clock drifts on active power sharing.

Fidelity of the model hinges on accurate identification of the Preisach density function. Existing work on the identification of density function usually involves applying an input that contains sufficient excitation and measuring a large set of output data. In this paper, we propose a novel compressive sensing-based Preisach model identification approach that requires much fewer measurements. The density function is transformed into the frequency domain, generating a sparse signal of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients, which can be efficiently reconstructed using compressive sensing algorithms. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the maximum absolute error are adopted to examine the density function reconstruction capability and the model estimation performance.

The proposed approach integrates off-line learning and online decomposition-synthesis together. Particularly, the off-line learning exploits advantages of iterative learning control in achieving precision tracking while maintaining good robustness, and the online decomposition-synthesis explores the benefits of uniform B-splines in decomposing arbitrary trajectory with few elements, and an inverse-Preisach-based superimposition approach to extend superimposition to nonlinear hysteresis operator. The proposed approach extends the decomposition based control scheme recently developed for linear time invariant (LTI) system to hysteresis compensation. A Hammerstein model is employed to decouple the hysteresis and the dynamics effect. It is shown that arbitrary tracking precision can be achieved by having enough number of elements in the decomposition, and the compensation factors are optimized to maximize the hysteresis compensation through the mapping of the input-output elements.

Unfortunately, vehicle steering dynamics become highly nonlinear and difficult to model near the limits of tire adhesion, making accurate control of these maneuvers difficult. One promising approach is to use iterative learning control (ILC) as a method of gradually determining the proper steering input for a transient driving maneuver by repeating the maneuver several times and using information from previous iterations to improve the reference tracking performance. This paper explores the viability of this concept by applying learning algorithms for multiple-lap path tracking of an autonomous race vehicle. Racing is an ideal scenario for iterative learning control because race cars drive the same sequence of turns while operating near the physical limits of tire-road friction. This creates a repeatable set of nonlinear vehicle dynamics and road conditions from lap to lap. Simulation results are used to design and test convergence of both a proportional-derivative (PD) and quadratically optimal (Q-ILC) iterative learning controller, and experimental results are presented on an Audi TTS race vehicle driving several laps around Thunderhill Raceway in Willows, CA at combined vehicle accelerations of up to 8 m/s\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

Design companies spend significant resources on static timing analysis (STA) tool licenses with signal integrity (SI) enabled. The runtime of the STA tools in SI mode is typically large due to complex algorithms and iterative calculation of timing windows to accurately determine aggressor and victim alignments, as well as delay and slew estimations. In this work, we develop machine learning-based predictors of timing in SI mode based on timing reports from non-SI mode. Timing analysis in non-SI mode is faster and the license costs can be several times less than those of SI mode. We determine electrical and logic structure parameters that affect the incremental arc delay/slew and path delay (i.e., the difference in arrival times at the clock pin of the launch flip-flop and the D pin of the capture flip-flop) in SI mode, and develop models that can predict these SI-aware delays. We report worst-case error of 7.0ps and average error of 0.7ps for our models to predict incremental transition time, worst-case error of 5.2ps and average error of 1.2ps for our models to predict incremental delay, and worst-case error of 8.2ps and average error of 1.7ps for our models to predict path delay, in 28nm FDSOI technology. We also demonstrate that our models are robust across designs and signoff constraints at a particular technology node.","doi":"10.1109/SLIP.2015.7171706","publicationTitle":"2015 ACM/IEEE International Workshop on System Level Interconnect Prediction (SLIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 ACM/IEEE International Workshop on System Level Interconnect Prediction (SLIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160953/7171703/07171706.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLIP.2015.7171706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7171703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SI for free: machine learning of interconnect coupling delay and transition effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7171706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171706/","displayDocTitle":"SI for free: machine learning of interconnect coupling delay and transition effects","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15329562","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7171706/","conferenceDate":"6-6 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SI for free: machine learning of interconnect coupling delay and transition effects","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SLIP15_paper_1a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081984S","chronDate":"6-6 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160953","isNumber":"7171703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160953","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7171703","articleId":"7171706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7171795,"authors":[{"name":"Yiling Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"],"firstName":"Yiling","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085527212"},{"name":"Siqian Shen","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"],"firstName":"Siqian","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085543627"},{"name":"Johanna L.

In this paper, we investigate data-driven optimization methods that are suited to dispatching power systems with uncertain balancing reserves provided by load control. Specifically, we consider a chance-constrained optimal power flow problem in which we aim to satisfy constraints that include random variables either jointly with a specified probability or individually with different risk tolerance levels. We focus on the realistic case in which we do not have full knowledge of the uncertainty distributions and compare distribution-free approaches with several stochastic optimization methods. We conduct experimental studies on the IEEE 9-bus test system assuming uncertainty in load, load-control reserve capacities, and renewable energy generation. The results show the computational efficacy of the distributionally robust approach and its flexibility in trading off between cost and robustness of solutions driven by data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Robustness","Optimization","Approximation methods","Generators","Wind forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load dispatching","load flow control","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power flow","reserve uncertainty","load control","supply-demand balance","data driven optimization methods","power system dispatching","uncertainty distributions","stochastic optimization method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7171795","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07171795.pdf","startPage":"3013","endPage":"3018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7171795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven optimization approaches for optimal power flow with uncertain reserves from load control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7171795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven optimization approaches for optimal power flow with uncertain reserves from load control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171795/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7171795/","accessionNumber":"15329695","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven optimization approaches for optimal power flow with uncertain reserves from load control","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100037S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7171795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7171822,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)"],"firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085590522"},{"name":"Prashant G.

However, these problems usually involve nonlinear models and non-Gaussian distributions. Two techniques are studied and compared to address nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity: the feedback particle filter (FPF) [16] and the nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) [11]. FPF introduces a novel feedback and innovation structure, and the computations can be approximately localized. On the other hand, NBP reformulates localization as an inference problem on spatio-temporal graphical models and implements a distributed sample-based message-passing scheme. Comparisons between FPF and NBP are provided regarding their structure, computational cost and accuracy, and are supported by numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7171822/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15343853","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of cooperative localization techniques for sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of cooperative localization techniques for sensor networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07963S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7171822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7171830,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085345679"},{"name":"Yu Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37280220400"},{"name":"Kaiming Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaiming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37595956000"},{"name":"Chuxiong Hu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chuxiong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37406530300"},{"name":"Haihua Mu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Haihua Mu","id":"37087183669"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7171830","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"abstract":"This paper presents a data-driven control scheme to iteratively achieve the desired objective criterion with significant improvement of the convergence performance for linear-time-invariant (LTI) single-input-single-output (SISO) systems.

And a novel iterative law based on the behavior is proposed, which has the ability to directly seek the optimal parameter that minimizes the objective criterion. Subsequently an unbiased gradient estimation based on the Toeplitz matrix is developed to simplify the practical implementation. The proposed algorithm not only guarantees the parameter converging to the global minimization, but also possesses high convergence rate. Comparative case studies are conducted in both simulation and experiment, which show the basic characteristics of excellent convergence accuracy and convergence rate.

When the two oscillators are not adjacent it is a measure of the coherence of the subnetwork defined by the two nodes. For the special case of two nodes connected by a single path our analytical results show that coherence in this subnetwork is independent of the nodes outside this path in first order networks and second order oscillator networks with global damping. However, computing the performance of oscillator networks with local damping requires the full network. These results allow one to isolate the performance of subsystems of interest or to evaluate the effect of changing the network topology of particular subsystems in, for example, large vehicle platoons, where local and global damping correspond to local and global velocity feedback.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7171862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7171862","startPage":"3434","endPage":"3439","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07171862.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nodal performance measures for oscillator networks with local and global damping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Nodal performance measures for oscillator networks with local and global damping","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7171862/","accessionNumber":"15330206","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171862/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nodal performance measures for oscillator networks with local and global damping","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060254S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7171862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7171873,"authors":[{"name":"Yufan Luo","affiliation":["Division of Systems Engineering"],"lastName":"Yufan Luo","id":"37085583927"},{"name":"Sean B.

The control approach relies on three components, i.e. a predictor, a reference model, and a controller. Specifically, since the predictor is designed to predict the system's output for any admissible control input, controlling the uncertain system is reduced to controlling the predictor, which is a virtual system with known dynamics and full state available. Subsequently, a full state feedback control law is designed to control the predictor output to approach the reference system, while the reference system tracks the desired trajectory, accounting for the actuator amplitude and rate saturation constraints. Ultimately, the control objective of driving the actual system output to track the desired trajectories is achieved by showing that the system output, the predictor output, and the reference system trajectory all converge to each other.

Simultaneous hysteresis and dynamics compensation is challenging as hysteresis modeling, in many existing control methods, is rather complicated and prone to errors and uncertainties. The hysteresis and dynamics are coupled in affecting the output tracking, and both hysteresis and dynamics tend to change due to the variations of the system conditions (e.g., the age of smart actuators). The proposed MFDIIC technique aims to compensate for both of these effects with no needs for modeling hysteresis and/or dynamics, and achieve both precision tracking and good robustness against hysteresis/dynamics changes. The convergence of the MFDIIC algorithm is analyzed with random output disturbance/noise considered. It is shown that precision tracking can be achieved with the tracking error close to the noise level in the statistical sense. The proposed MFDIIC method is demonstrated through implementation on high-speed large-range output tracking of two different types of smart actuators with symmetric and asymmetric hysteresis behavior, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Aerodynamics","Intelligent actuators","Heuristic algorithms","Tracking","Frequency response","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","differential equations","hysteresis","intelligent actuators","iterative methods","motion control","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous hysteresis-dynamics compensation","high-speed large-range motion tracking","data-driven modeling-free differential-inversion-based iterative control method","MFDIIC method","nonlinear hysteresis","hysteresis-like hammerstein systems dynamics","hysteresis modeling","random output disturbance/noise","precision tracking","tracking error","noise level","high-speed large-range output tracking","smart actuators","asymmetric hysteresis behavior"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7171882","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07171882.pdf","startPage":"3558","endPage":"3563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7171882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modeling-free differential-inversion-based iterative control approach to simultaneous hysteresis-dynamics compensation: High-speed large-range motion tracking example","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7171882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A modeling-free differential-inversion-based iterative control approach to simultaneous hysteresis-dynamics compensation: High-speed large-range motion tracking example","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171882/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7171882/","accessionNumber":"15329658","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modeling-free differential-inversion-based iterative control approach to simultaneous hysteresis-dynamics compensation: High-speed large-range motion tracking example","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054818S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7171882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7171902,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this work, considering the whole power network (PN) as a single graph, the recently introduced sparse formulation of the Power line Outage Identification (POI-SRP) is represented. Our main contribution is to improve and generalize the POI-SRP results for single and multiple line outage identification using matrix analysis and the structured pattern in multiple POI. We address the high coherence and high correlation issues in corresponding POI-SRP sensing matrices. In order to solve these problems, we perform a comprehensive study on the corresponding matrices of the IEEE standard networks in POI-SRP. Our main approach will be based on the necessary and sufficient conditions that these matrices should satisfy in order to be applicable to the Sparse Recovery Problem (SRP). First, we discuss the effect that node-line connection structures in the PN model have on the coherence. We describe a modification of the PN model in order to decrease the coherence. Next, using the IEEE standard 118-BUS as a case study, we discuss how the high correlation problem can be solved by applying mathematical matrix analysis such as matrix decomposition and improving the final POI results. The third main contribution is the identification of the structured outages in POI-SRP. In this work, the boundary conditions of the Clustered OMP recovery algorithm are modified (MCOMP) and finally it will be shown how the existence of structured sparsity in multiple POI problems (Structured-POI-SRP) helps MCOMP to improve the POI results.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7171902","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07171902.pdf","startPage":"3682","endPage":"3689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7171902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of compressive sensing for distributed and structured power line outage detection in smart grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7171902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171902/","displayDocTitle":"Application of compressive sensing for distributed and structured power line outage detection in smart grids","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15343852","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7171902/","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of compressive sensing for distributed and structured power line outage detection in smart grids","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108494S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7171902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7171953,"authors":[{"name":"Achilles Theodorakopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Achilles","lastName":"Theodorakopoulos","id":"37085465734"},{"name":"George A.

The problem is to minimize the total network objective function subject to the vehicles' individual constraints and their shared collision avoidance constraints over a given time horizon. The proposed controller, a proximal message passing (PMP) algorithm, is iterative: At each iteration, every vehicle passes simple messages to its neighbors and then solves a convex program that minimizes its own objective function and a simple regularization term that only depends on the messages it received in the previous iteration. As a result, the method is completely decentralized and needs no global coordination other than synchronizing iterations. The problems that each vehicle solves can be done extremely efficiently and in parallel. We demonstrate the method on several examples using a model predictive control framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15329730","htmlLink":"/document/7171976/","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Collision Avoidance via proximal message passing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Collision Avoidance via proximal message passing","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08539S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7171976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7171982,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

The properties and imperfections of the actuator and the underlying components between the sensor and the actuator mainly lead to deterministic reproducible position errors. The advantage of these systematic cyclic disturbances is that they can be compensated for, once identified. In this paper we use nonuniform sampling combined with Compressive Sensing (CS) to identify high spatial frequency disturbances in positioning systems when the spatial sample period is limited. The proposed strategy is implemented on the paper positioning unit of a wide format printer, to identify the cyclic disturbances in the positioning of paper with respect to the printheads. Based on CS, we present a strategy to identify the cyclic disturbances in the paper positioning from randomly obtained relative position error measurements. Experiments with a limited spatial sample period show that the high disturbance frequencies are also successfully identified.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07171982.pdf","startPage":"4162","endPage":"4167","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7171982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7171982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7171982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of cyclic disturbances in positioning systems via compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grippers","Printers","Position measurement","Frequency measurement","Actuators","Measurement uncertainty","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic disturbances","industrial precision positioning systems","compressive sensing","deterministic reproducible position errors","nonuniform sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7171982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Identification of cyclic disturbances in positioning systems via compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7171982/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15343885","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of cyclic disturbances in positioning systems via compressive sensing","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063727S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7171982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7172007,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Jain","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, US"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085409747"},{"name":"Emrah Biyik","affiliation":["Yasar Universitesi, Izmir, Izmir, TR"],"firstName":"Emrah","lastName":"Biyik","id":"37426137900"},{"name":"Aranya Chakrabortty","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, US"],"firstName":"Aranya","lastName":"Chakrabortty","id":"37295891300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7172007","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172007","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Damping","Trajectory","Discrete Fourier transforms","Oscillators","Power systems","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centralised control","control system synthesis","damping","discrete Fourier transforms","matrix algebra","minimisation","power system control","predictive control","quadratic programming","synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model predictive control design","selective modal damping","power systems","real-time predictive control technique","dominant interarea oscillation modes","power system stabilizers","PSS","synchronous generators","centralized model predictive controller","centralized MPC","selective discrete Fourier transform","SDFT approach","weighting matrix","quadratic minimization","IEEE 39-bus prototype power system model","New England system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power systems","model predictive control","selective modal damping"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel real-time predictive control technique to damp dominant inter-area oscillation modes in power systems. We first show that conventional Power System Stabilizers (PSS) in synchronous generators are best suited to damp only the intra-area oscillation modes, and participate poorly in inter-area damping. We then design a centralized Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to provide supplementary control to these conventional PSSs based on a Selective Discrete Fourier Transform (SDFT) approach. The SDFT extracts the energies associated with the inter-area frequency components in the output spectrum of the system, and uses this information to construct a weighting matrix Q. The MPC is then formulated as a quadratic minimization of the outputs using Q, resulting in damping only the inter-area modes of interest. In reality, however, the most dominant DFT magnitudes will not be known ahead of time since they are decided by the location of the disturbance. Therefore, we next augment the MPC design by predicting the dominant DFT magnitudes in the desired low frequency range using online measured data, and tuning Q accordingly. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using an IEEE 39-bus prototype power system model for the New England system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7172007","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07172007.pdf","startPage":"4314","endPage":"4319","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7172007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model predictive control design for selective modal damping in power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A model predictive control design for selective modal damping in power systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172007/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15330231","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172007/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model predictive control design for selective modal damping in power systems","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060764S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7172007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7172008,"authors":[{"name":"Stefanos Baros","affiliation":["The ECE Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Stefanos","lastName":"Baros","id":"37085367797"},{"name":"Marija D.

It uses a navigation function approach when the UAV is clear from conflict and smoothly switches to a collision avoidance maneuver when other UAVs are encountered. We show that the proposed avoidance algorithm can ensure a collision-free path. We also carry out a throughout quantitative analysis of the algorithm singularities and propose heuristic recipes for avoiding deadlock situations.

Given a set defined as the superlevel set of a function, h, the main result is a constructive means for generating control barrier functions that guarantee forward invariance of this set. In particular, if the function defining the set has relative degree n, an iterative methodology utilizing higher order derivatives of h provably results in a control barrier function that can be explicitly derived. To demonstrate these formal results, they are applied in the context of bipedal robotic walking. Physical constraints, e.g., joint limits, are represented by control barrier functions and unified with control objectives expressed through control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) via quadratic program (QP) based controllers. The end result is the generation of stable walking satisfying physical realizability constraints for a model of the bipedal robot AMBER2.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7172044","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07172044.pdf","startPage":"4542","endPage":"4548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7172044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control barrier function based quadratic programs with application to bipedal robotic walking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Control barrier function based quadratic programs with application to bipedal robotic walking","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172044/","accessionNumber":"15344026","publicationDate":"July 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control barrier function based quadratic programs with application to bipedal robotic walking","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060897S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7172044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7172064,"authors":[{"name":"Denis Efimov","affiliation":["Non-A team @ Inria, University ITMO, Saint Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Efimov","id":"37299690800"},{"name":"Romeo Ortega","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Systemes, Ecole Superieure d'Electricit\u00e9 (SUPELEC), France"],"firstName":"Romeo","lastName":"Ortega","id":"37085448852"},{"name":"Johannes Schiffer","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Schiffer","id":"37528684200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7172064","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Inverters","Microgrids","Stability analysis","Power system stability","Robustness","Asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","distributed power generation","feedback","invertors","Lyapunov methods","pendulums","power generation control","power system stability","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["droop-controlled inverter-based microgrid","input-to-state stability investigation","Lyapunov-Razumikhin function","ISS multistable system","feedback","nonlinear pendulum","delay-dependent robustness condition","asymptotic phase-locking analysis"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by the problem of phase-locking in droop-controlled inverter-based microgrids with delays, the recently developed theory of input-to-state stability (ISS) for multistable systems is extended to the case of multistable systems with delayed dynamics.

It arises from limits in sensor dynamic range, and may be exacerbated by poor calibration of sensors. Censoring is often referred to as a clipped measurement or limit-of-detection discontinuity, and is represented as a piecewise-linear transform of the output variable. The slope of the piecewise-linear transform is zero in the censored region. This form of nonlinearity presents significant challenges when a nonlinear approximation to the Kalman filter is to be used as an estimator. The Tobit Kalman filter is a new method that is a computationally efficient, unbiased estimator for linear dynamical systems with censored output. In this paper, we use Monte Carlo methods to compare the performance of the Tobit Kalman Filter to the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter. We show that the Tobit Kalman Filter reliably provides accurate estimates of the state and state error covariance with censored measurement data, while both the EKF and the UKF provide unreliable estimates in censored data conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15343886","htmlLink":"/document/7172142/","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear estimators for censored data: A comparison of the EKF, the UKF and the Tobit Kalman filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear estimators for censored data: A comparison of the EKF, the UKF and the Tobit Kalman filter","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058688S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7172142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7172150,"authors":[{"name":"Soumalya Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Soumalya","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"38237499800"},{"name":"Pritthi Chattopdhyay","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Pritthi","lastName":"Chattopdhyay","id":"37085432632"},{"name":"Asok Ray","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Asok","lastName":"Ray","id":"37277094200"},{"name":"Shashi Phoha","affiliation":["Applied Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Shashi","lastName":"Phoha","id":"37279681900"},{"name":"Mark Levi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Levi","id":"37085439351"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7172150","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Time series analysis","Feature extraction","Entropy","Optimization","Estimation","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemiluminescence","feature extraction","finite state machines","information theory","optimisation","parameter estimation","probability","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alphabet size selection","low-dimensional feature extraction","maximization","input state probability vector","parameter identification","sinusoidal input excitation","chemiluminescence data","lean blow-out phenomena","LBO phenomena","laboratory-scale combustor","Duffing system","data partitioning","PFSA","probabilistic finite state automata","symbol sequence","sensor signals","DDDAS","dynamic data-driven application systems","pattern recognition tool","STSA","discretization","symbolic time series analysis","information-theoretic approach","symbolization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-series Analysis","Feature Extraction","Pattern Classification","Symbolic Dynamic Filtering","Partitioning Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172150","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7172150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7172150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07172150.pdf","startPage":"5194","endPage":"5199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alphabet size selection for symbolization of dynamic data-driven systems: An information-theoretic approach","abstract":"Symbolic time series analysis (STSA) is built upon the concept of symbolic dynamics that deals with discretization of dynamical systems in both space and time. The notion of STSA has led to the development of a pattern recognition tool in the paradigm of dynamic data-driven application systems (DDDAS), where a time series of sensor signals is partitioned to obtain a symbol sequence that, in turn, leads to the construction of probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA). Although modeling of PFSA from symbol sequences has been widely reported, similar efforts have not been expended to investigate how to find an appropriate alphabet size for partitioning of time series so that the symbol sequences can be optimally generated. This paper addresses this critical issue and proposes an information-theoretic procedure of data partitioning to extract low-dimensional features from time series. The key idea lies in optimal partitioning of the time series via maximization of the mutual information between the input state probability vector and pattern classes. The proposed procedure has been validated by two examples. The first example elucidates the underlying concept of data partitioning for parameter identification in a Duffing system with a sinusoidal input excitation. The second example is built upon time series of chemiluminescence data to predict lean blow-out (LBO) phenomena in a laboratory-scale combustor. Classification performance of data partitioning is analyzed in each of the two examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172150/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15330155","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Alphabet size selection for symbolization of dynamic data-driven systems: An information-theoretic approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alphabet size selection for symbolization of dynamic data-driven systems: An information-theoretic approach","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0721S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7172150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7172151,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37085556747"},{"name":"Asok Ray","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Asok","lastName":"Ray","id":"37277094200"},{"name":"Pritthi Chattopadhyay","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Pritthi","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","id":"37085535977"},{"name":"Christopher D.

To show the efficiency of the SDDOB, numerical simulations of a control application which combines the SDDOB and a PI controller for the purpose of piston position tracking problem is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172196/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15329591","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampled data observer design based inter-sample output predictor for Electro-Hydraulic Actuators systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled data observer design based inter-sample output predictor for Electro-Hydraulic Actuators systems","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05905S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7172196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7172198,"authors":[{"name":"Weichuan Liu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weichuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085334595"},{"name":"Long Cheng","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37292880600"},{"name":"Zeng-Guang Hou","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zeng-Guang","lastName":"Hou","id":"37279945000"},{"name":"Min Tan","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274596200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7172198","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error compensation","Hysteresis","Mathematical model","Steady-state","Piezoelectric actuators","Optimal control","Predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","neurocontrollers","piezoelectric actuators","predictive control","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inversion-free model predictive control","error compensation","piezoelectric actuators","dynamic linearized multi-layer feedforward neural network model","constrained quadratic programming","steady-state error","PEA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hysteresis","neural network modeling","dynamic linearization","model predictive control","piezoelectric actuators"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172198","abstract":"This paper addresses an inversion-free model predictive control with error compensation for piezoelectric actuators (PEAs), which is based on a dynamic linearized multi-layer feedforward neural network model.

By using the technique of constrained quadratic programming, the proposed method still works well when dealing with the plant physical constraints. Moreover, an error compensation term is introduced into the control law to attenuate the steady-state error. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a commercial PEA.

In this regard, a fast and robust multi-scale symbolic time series analysis (MSTSA) framework has been formulated to detect and classify human activities from seismic signatures. The building block of the proposed framework is built upon the concept of applying the short-length symbolic time-series online classifier (SSTOC) via Dirichlet-Compound-Multinomial model (DCM) construction. The algorithm operates on symbol sequences that are generated from seismic time-series and intermediate event class time-series at different time scales. These building blocks, with different window sizes, are cascaded in multiple layers for event detection and activity classification. A variety of experiments have been conducted in the field, which include realistic scenarios of different types of walking/digging. The results of experiments show that an accuracy of more than 90% and a false alarm of around 5% can be achieved in real time for activity detection and recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7172251","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07172251.pdf","startPage":"5818","endPage":"5823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7172251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time activity recognition from seismic signature via multi-scale symbolic time series analysis (MSTSA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172251/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time activity recognition from seismic signature via multi-scale symbolic time series analysis (MSTSA)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15329981","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172251/","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time activity recognition from seismic signature via multi-scale symbolic time series analysis (MSTSA)","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086856S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160954","isNumber":"7170700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160954","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7170700","articleId":"7172251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7172269,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael Louca","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Louca","id":"37085524916"},{"name":"Eilyan Bitar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Eilyan","lastName":"Bitar","id":"37547084200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8685-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"7172269","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","IP networks","Polynomials","Programming","Mathematical programming","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","concave programming","constraint handling","graph theory","perturbation techniques","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acyclic semidefinite approximations","quadratically constrained quadratic programs","nonconvex optimization problems","NP-hard problem","complex QCQP","arbitrary graph structure","structured perturbations","acyclic QCQP","sufficient conditions","polynomial time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quadraticlly Constrained Quadratic Programming","Semidefinite Programming","Convex Relaxation","Approximation Guarantees"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172269","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2015.7172269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2015.7172269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7170700","publicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160954/7170700/07172269.pdf","startPage":"5925","endPage":"5930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acyclic semidefinite approximations of quadratically constrained quadratic programs","abstract":"Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) belong to a class of nonconvex optimization problems that are NP-hard in general.

There are a number of surveys on security issues on WSNs, which, however, did not focus on public-key cryptographic primitives in WSNs. In this survey, we provide a deeper understanding of public-key cryptographic primitives in WSNs including identity-based cryptography and discuss their main directions and some open research issues that can be further pursued. We investigate state-of-the-art software implementation results of public-key cryptographic primitives in terms of execution time, energy consumption and resource occupation on constrained wireless devices choosing popular IEEE 802.15.4-compliant WSN hardware platforms, used in real-life deployments. This survey provides invaluable insights on public-key cryptographic primitives on WSN platforms, and solutions to find tradeoffs between cost, performance and security for designing security protocols in WSNs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2459691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","startPage":"577","endPage":"601","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/07172449.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Public-Key Cryptographic Primitives in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172449/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Public-Key Cryptographic Primitives in Wireless Sensor Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","accessionNumber":"15730360","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Institute for Mathematical Sciences funded by Ministry of Science"},{"fundingName":"ICT"},{"fundingName":"Future Planning of Korea","grantNumber":"B21503-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Public-Key Cryptographic Primitives in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"comst-shim-2459691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.290872S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"7172449","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172454,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["ETSIS Telecommunication, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085357622"},{"name":"Cesar Briso","affiliation":["ETSI Telecommunication, Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Cesar","lastName":"Briso","id":"37296214000"},{"name":"Jean Rapha\u00ebl Olivier Fernandez","affiliation":["ETSI Telecommunication, Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jean Rapha\u00ebl Olivier","lastName":"Fernandez","id":"38257991300"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 I.

To tackle the computation complexity issues, we present a constraint-relaxed problem and provide corresponding solutions using Markov chain theory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","volume":"60","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15475009","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172466/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Jamming Attacks on Remote State Estimation in Cyber-Physical Systems: A Game-Theoretic Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC GRF","grantNumber":"618612"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"U1401253"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming Attacks on Remote State Estimation in Cyber-Physical Systems: A Game-Theoretic Approach","sourcePdf":"tac-shi-2461851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0798S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7274445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"7274445","articleId":"7172466","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7172470,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Sajad Sadough","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University G.C., Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohammad Sajad","lastName":"Sadough","id":"38556490700"},{"name":"Zahra Chamideh","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University G.C., Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Zahra","lastName":"Chamideh","id":"37085747218"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7172470","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Bayes methods","Approximation methods","Bit error rate","Relays","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","Bayes methods","channel estimation","error statistics","iterative methods","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variational Bayesian method","signal detection","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","data detection","amplify-and-forward relay network","AF relay networks","imperfect partial channel knowledge","variational Bayesian approximation","VBA-based estimators","iterative Bayesian method","iterative estimator","channel estimation errors","numerical analysis","VBA method","bit error rate","mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward","OFDM","bit-interleaved coded modulation","variational Bayesian inference"]},{"kwd":["Amplify-and-forward","OFDM","bit-interleaved coded modulation","variational Bayesian inference"]}],"abstract":"We propose improved joint channel estimation and data detection in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network in the case of imperfect partial channel knowledge at the destination.

The electromagnetic measurements of the signal transmitted by the BumbleBee radar are made to fully characterize the sensor and its limitations.

A new dynamic stochastic state (DS-state) is then defined to characterize the goal set of a dialog state at different stages of the dialog process. Furthermore, an entropy minimization dialog management (EMDM) strategy is also proposed to combine with the DS-states to facilitate a robust and efficient solution in reaching a user's goals. A song-on-demand task, with a total of 38 117 songs and 12 attributes corresponding to each song, is used to test the performance of the proposed approach. In an ideal simulation, assuming no errors, the EMDM strategy is the most efficient goal-seeking method among all tested approaches, returning the correct song within 3.3 dialog turns on average. Furthermore, in a practical scenario, with top five candidates to handle the unavoidable automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) errors, the results show that only 61.7% of the dialog goals can be successfully obtained in 6.23 dialog turns on average when random questions are asked by the system, whereas if the proposed DS-states are updated with the top five candidates from the SLU output using the proposed EMDM strategy executed at every DS-state, then a 86.7% dialog success rate can be accomplished effectively within 5.17 dialog turns on average. We also demonstrate that entropy-based DM strategies are more efficient than non-entropy based DM. Moreover, using the goal set distributions in EMDM, the results are better than those without them, such as in sate-of-the-art database summary DM.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2015.2462712","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7140863/07172488.pdf","startPage":"2026","endPage":"2035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2015.2462712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic Framework for Representing Dialog Systems and Entropy-Based Dialog Management Through Dynamic Stochastic State Evolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172488/","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Framework for Representing Dialog Systems and Entropy-Based Dialog Management Through Dynamic Stochastic State Evolution","volume":"23","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15357145","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172488/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Tsinghua University","grantNumber":"20111081023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61170197"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Framework for Representing Dialog Systems and Entropy-Based Dialog Management Through Dynamic Stochastic State Evolution","sourcePdf":"taslp-wu-2462712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085799S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7140863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7140863","articleId":"7172488","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172493,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Lan Zhang","affiliation":["Center for SCDM, NIT, Zhejiang University, China","Department of Computer and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/9109589/7172493/zhang-2462361-small.gif","p":["Hao Lan Zhang received the PhD degree in computer science from Victoria University, Australia.

Different from traditional large data sets, the term \u201cBig Data\u201d not only means the large size of data volume but also indicates the high velocity of data generation. However, current data mining and analytical techniques are facing the challenge of dealing with large volume data in a short period of time. This paper explores the efficiency of utilizing the Normal Distribution (ND) method for splitting and processing large volume medical data in cloud environment, which can provide representative information in the split data sets. The ND-based new model consists of two stages. The first stage adopts the ND method for large data sets splitting and processing, which can reduce the volume of data sets. The second stage implements the ND-based model in a cloud computing infrastructure for allocating the split data sets.

This is achieved by allowing the number of antennas and RF chains to grow very large. However, the challenges include high system complexity and hardware energy consumption. Here we investigate the possibilities to reduce the required number of RF chains, by performing antenna selection. While this approach is not a very effective strategy for theoretical independent Rayleigh fading channels, a substantial reduction in the number of RF chains can be achieved for real massive MIMO channels, without significant performance loss. We evaluate antenna selection performance on measured channels at 2.6 GHz, using a linear and a cylindrical array, both having 128 elements. Sum-rate maximization is used as the criterion for antenna selection. A selection scheme based on convex optimization is nearly optimal and used as a benchmark. The achieved sum-rate is compared with that of a very simple scheme that selects the antennas with the highest received power. The power-based scheme gives performance close to the convex optimization scheme, for the measured channels. This observation indicates a potential for significant reductions of massive MIMO implementation complexity, by reducing the number of RF chains and performing antenna selection using simple algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2462350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2462350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07172496.pdf","startPage":"3917","endPage":"3928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO in Real Propagation Environments: Do All Antennas Contribute Equally?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO in Real Propagation Environments: Do All Antennas Contribute Equally?","volume":"63","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172496/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676741","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172496/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)","grantNumber":"619086"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO in Real Propagation Environments: Do All Antennas Contribute Equally?","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gao-2462350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106529S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7172496","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7172501,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Oliveri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications Engineering, and Naval Architecture (DITEN), University of Genoa, Genova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7851099/7172501/olive-2462293-small.gif","p":["Alberto Oliveri received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Genoa, Genova, Italy, in 2009 and 2013, respectively.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications Engineering, and Naval Architecture, University of Genoa.

SOH algorithms that do not use electrochemical-based models may have more difficulty maintaining an accurate battery model as the cell ages under varying degradation modes, such as lithium consumption at the solid-electrolyte interface or active material dissolution. Furthermore, efforts to validate electrochemical model-based state estimation algorithms with experimental aging data are limited, particularly for composite electrode cells.

However, the standard procedures used to collect data can be prohibitively time consuming. One way of increasing the efficiency of data collection is to reduce the duration of test sequences from a 10-s length currently used in most subjective video quality assessment (VQA) experiments. Here, we explore the impact of reducing sequence length upon perceptual accuracy when identifying compression artifacts. A group of four reference sequences, together with five levels of distortion, are used to compare the subjective ratings of viewers watching videos between 1.5 and 10 s long. We identify a smooth function indicating that accuracy increases linearly as the length of the sequences increases from 1.5 to 7 s. The accuracy of observers viewing 1.5-s sequences was significantly inferior to those viewing sequences of 5, 7, and 10 s. We argue that sequences between 5 and 10 s produce satisfactory levels of accuracy but the practical benefits of acquiring more data lead us to recommend the use of 5-s sequences for future VQA studies that use the double stimulus continuous quality scale methodology.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2461971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7723941/07172512.pdf","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2461971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Optimal Presentation Duration for Subjective Video Quality Assessment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172512/","displayDocTitle":"On the Optimal Presentation Duration for Subjective Video Quality Assessment","volume":"26","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16425700","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172512/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/J019291/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Optimal Presentation Duration for Subjective Video Quality Assessment","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-moss-2461971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099623S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7723941","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7723941","articleId":"7172512","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172513,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiano Cervellera","affiliation":["National Research Council, Institute of Intelligent Systems for Automation, Genova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7491394/7172513/cerve-2453123-small.gif","p":["Cristiano Cervellera received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering and computer science from the University of Genoa, Genova, Italy, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.","He is currently a Researcher with the Genoa Branch of the Institute of Intelligent Systems for Automation of the Italian National Research Council, Genova.

It is known that the selection of sampling points at which the value function is observed is a key factor when such function is approximated by a model based on a finite number of evaluations. A standard approach consists in generating these points through a random or deterministic procedure, aiming at a balanced covering of the state space. Yet, this solution may not be efficient if the state trajectories are not uniformly distributed. Here, we propose to exploit F-discrepancy, a quantity that measures how closely a set of random points represents a probability distribution, and introduce an example of an algorithm based on such concept to automatically select point sets that are efficient with respect to the underlying Markovian process. An error analysis of the approximate solution is provided, showing how the proposed algorithm enables convergence under suitable regularity hypotheses. Then, simulation results are provided concerning an inventory forecasting test problem. The tests confirm in general the important role of F-discrepancy, and show how the proposed algorithm is able to yield better results than uniform sampling, using sets even 50 times smaller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Function approximation","Mathematical model","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Dynamic programming","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","inventory management","Markov processes","sampling methods","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inventory forecasting test problem","regularity hypotheses","approximate solution error analysis","probability distribution","state trajectories","state space","deterministic procedure","random procedure","standard approach","value function","sampling point selection","continuous-state finite-horizon Markovian decision problems","state sample point generation","approximate dynamic programming","F-discrepancy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate dynamic programming (ADP)","F-discrepancy","Markovian decision problem (MDP)","state sampling","value function approximation"]},{"kwd":["Approximate dynamic programming (ADP)","${F}$ -discrepancy","Markovian decision problem (MDP)","state sampling","value function approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2453123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7491394/07172513.pdf","startPage":"1628","endPage":"1639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7491394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2453123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"--Discrepancy for Efficient Sampling in Approximate Dynamic Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Discrepancy for Efficient Sampling in Approximate Dynamic Programming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172513/","volume":"46","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172513/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16073230","pubMedId":"26241987","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Discrepancy for Efficient Sampling in Approximate Dynamic Programming","sourcePdf":"tcyb-cervellera-2453123-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168486S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7491394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7491394","articleId":"7172513","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7172516,"authors":[{"name":"Shiqi Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Media, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7558256/7172516/wang-2461891-small.gif","p":["Shiqi Wang (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in computer application technology from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2014.","He was an Intern with Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, in 2011.

The chroma downsampling, which is commonly applied to the chroma component in screen content image representation and processing (e.g., YUV4:2:0 compression), will significantly degrade the image quality and create annoying artifacts such as blur and color shifting. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose luma aware chroma downsampling and upsampling algorithms to jointly improve the quality of the chroma image reconstruction. Guided by the luma information, the chroma upsampling algorithm is proposed with the utilization of major color and index map representation. The geometric information-based linear mapping is developed to transfer the structure of luma to the interpolated chroma. Subsequently, the error sensitivity of the upsampling method is analyzed, and content dependent downsampling algorithm is presented to minimize the error sensitivity function. We further explore the applicability of the proposed scheme in the scenario of screen content compression, targeting at improving the decoded chroma image quality for display. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7558256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2461891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7558256/07172516.pdf","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1609","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2461891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Chroma Downsampling and Upsampling for Screen Content Image","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Joint Chroma Downsampling and Upsampling for Screen Content Image","volume":"26","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7172516/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16283100","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172516/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2015CB351800"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61322106 and 61421062"},{"fundingName":"Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Chroma Downsampling and Upsampling for Screen Content Image","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-wang-2461891-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105379S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7558256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7558256","articleId":"7172516","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7172517,"authors":[{"name":"Uzma Afsheen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7172517/afshe-2462347_print-small.gif","p":["\nUzma Afsheen received the  bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.

STSTCs achieve the diversity order expected of four transmit antennas while using only two reconfigurable transmit antennas. Our code out performs the existing super orthogonal space time trellis code, which fails to achieve full diversity in a reconfigurable antenna system. The proposed 4 trellis state STSTC is designed based on the following performance criteria: minimum coding gain distance of the minimum return path (CGD MRP), performance factor (PF), rank of the partial valid path (RPVP) on top of traditional minimum coding gain distance of parallel path (CGD PP). We show through analysis and simulations that minimum CGD PP is not a sufficient criteria and that additional performance gains are provided by considering the CGD MRP.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2462347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07172517.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2462347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","startPage":"3660","endPage":"3670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space Time State Trellis Codes for MIMO Systems Using Reconfigurable Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space Time State Trellis Codes for MIMO Systems Using Reconfigurable Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524640","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172517/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Time State Trellis Codes for MIMO Systems Using Reconfigurable Antennas","sourcePdf":"tcomm-martin-2462347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107908S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7172517","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172521,"authors":[{"name":"Rob Heylen","affiliation":["Vision Lab, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7312390/7172521/heyle-2453915-small.gif","p":["\n\nRob Heylen (M'10) received the B.S, M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2001, 2003, and 2008, respectively, all in physics, with work in the field of statistical mechanics.","In 2009, he joined iMinds-Vision Lab, Department of Physics, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium, as a Postdoctoral Researcher.

These models do not consider endmember interactions involving more than two endmembers, although such interactions might compose a nontrivial part of the observed spectrum in scenarios involving bright materials and complex geometrical structures, such as vegetation and intimate mixtures. In this paper, we present an extension of these models to include an infinite number of interactions. Several technical problems, such as divergence of the resulting series, can be avoided by introducing an optical interaction probability, which becomes the only free parameter of the model in addition to the abundances. We present an unmixing strategy based on this multilinear mixing (MLM) model; present comparisons with the bilinear models and the Hapke model for intimate mixing; and show that, in several scenarios, the MLM model obtains superior results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2453915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312390","startPage":"240","endPage":"251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7312390/07172521.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multilinear Mixing Model for Nonlinear Spectral Unmixing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172521/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multilinear Mixing Model for Nonlinear Spectral Unmixing","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15568364","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Flemish Fund for Scientific Research (FWO-Vlaanderen)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multilinear Mixing Model for Nonlinear Spectral Unmixing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-heylen-2453915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085817S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7312390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"7312390","articleId":"7172521","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7172523,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7235010/7172523/chen-2462756-small.gif","p":["Kan Chen received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 2010, and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA, in 2012.

End users in a relay-based LTE-A network can recruit relay nodes to cooperate as virtual antenna arrays, thereby reaping the benefits offered by multiple input single output (MIMO) techniques. Although the relay-based cooperative MIMO (coop MIMO) implementation in LTE-A networks improves performance, security issues are often overlooked. This paper introduces a physical layer security scheme for point-to-point networks, and extends this scheme to MIMO networks. Two practical relay-based coop MIMO architectures and corresponding secret key generation (SKG) schemes are presented. For both the MIMO and coop MIMO networks, the impact of proposed power allocation on SKG rate (SKGR) is quantified via the theoretical and numerical analysis. Results indicate that the proposed power allocation scheme can offer 15%-30% increase in SKGR relative to MIMO/coop MIMO networks with equal power allocation at low-power region, thereby improving network security.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret Key Generation Rate With Power Allocation in Relay-Based LTE-A Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2462756","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7235010/07172523.pdf","startPage":"2424","endPage":"2434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2462756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7235010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Secret Key Generation Rate With Power Allocation in Relay-Based LTE-A Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7172523/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15451722","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret Key Generation Rate With Power Allocation in Relay-Based LTE-A Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-chen-2462756-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083781S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7235010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7235010","articleId":"7172523","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172526,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Zhu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7742433/7172526/jizhu-2462020-small.gif","p":["Jia Zhu received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and technology from Hohai University, Nanjing, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NUPT), Nanjing, China, in 2010.","From June 2010 to June 2012, she was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA.

We consider a cellular network composed of two user terminals that are intended to communicate with a common base station (BS), where a two-way relay node is used to assist the bidirectional communications between the users and BS. We propose an opportunistic network coding (ONC) scheme with the two-way relay, called two-way ONC, which operates depending on whether or not the relay node successfully decodes data packets of the user terminals and BS. Closed-form outage probability expressions of the uplink transmission (from users to BS) and downlink transmission (from BS to users) are derived for the proposed two-way ONC scheme in the presence of co-channel interference over Rayleigh fading channels. We also develop the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the two-way ONC scheme and show that it obtains the full diversity and an increased multiplexing gain, as compared with conventional one-way relay methods. Additionally, numerical outage probability results demonstrate that the proposed two-way ONC scheme outperforms the conventional one-way relay approaches in terms of improving the communication's reliability against co-channel interference.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2462020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7742433/07172526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2462020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7742433","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Opportunistic Network Coding for Improving Wireless Reliability Against Co-Channel Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Opportunistic Network Coding for Improving Wireless Reliability Against Co-Channel Interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16448638","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7172526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61302104 and 61401223"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140887"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005374","fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications","grantNumber":"NY213014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Opportunistic Network Coding for Improving Wireless Reliability Against Co-Channel Interference","sourcePdf":"tii-zhu-2462020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094241S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7742433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7742433","articleId":"7172526","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172527,"authors":[{"name":"Saleh Masoodian","affiliation":["Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7365508/7172527/masoo-2457418-small.gif","p":["Saleh Masoodian (S\u201908) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran, in 2012.

Two PDF controllers with different terms in the inner feedback path are developed for an inverter current feedback system and a grid current feedback system, respectively. For the inverter current feedback system, a simple PDF controller with a proportional term is used. The influence of the controller parameters on the transient performance is discussed in detail. Compared with a PI controller, the PDF controller is able to eliminate the transient overshoot and oscillation easily, while maintaining a fast response. For the gird current feedback system, a PDF controller with a proportional term and a second-order derivative is developed. The implementation and design of the PDF controller are presented. Active damping is achieved with only the feedback from the grid current, and at the same time, the system transient response is improved. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results verify the advantages of the PDF control over PI control methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172529/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677500","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7172529/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pseudo-Derivative-Feedback Current Control for Three-Phase Grid-Connected Inverters With <i>LCL </i> Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo-Derivative-Feedback Current Control for Three-Phase Grid-Connected Inverters With <italic>LCL </italic> Filters","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2462331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111772S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7172529","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7172530,"authors":[{"name":"Changxing Ding","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems and the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, 81 Broadway Street, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7398218/7172530/ding-small.gif","p":["Changxing Ding received the BE degree in automation from Shandong\n University of Science and Technology, and the ME degree in control science and engineering from Harbin Institute of\n Technology, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

Specifically, the MDML-DCPs scheme exploits the first derivative of Gaussian operator to reduce the impact of differences in illumination and then computes the DCP feature at both the holistic and component levels. DCP is a novel face image descriptor inspired by the unique textural structure of human faces. It is computationally efficient and only doubles the cost of computing local binary patterns, yet is extremely robust to pose and expression variations. MDML-DCPs comprehensively yet efficiently encodes the invariant characteristics of a face image from multiple levels into patterns that are highly discriminative of inter-personal differences but robust to intra-personal variations. Experimental results on the FERET, CAS-PERL-R1, FRGC 2.0, and LFW databases indicate that DCP outperforms the state-of-the-art local descriptors (e.g., LBP, LTP, LPQ, POEM, tLBP, and LGXP) for both face identification and face verification tasks. More impressively, the best performance is achieved on the challenging LFW and FRGC 2.0 databases by deploying MDML-DCPs in a simple recognition scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7398218/07172530.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2462338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2462338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Directional Multi-Level Dual-Cross Patterns for Robust Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Facial features","Robustness","Feature extraction","Lighting","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image coding","image texture","lighting","pose estimation","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust unconstrained face recognition","illumination","multidirectional multilevel dual-cross patterns","MDML-DCP scheme","Gaussian operator","DCP feature","component levels","holistic levels","face image descriptor","human face textural structure","local binary patterns","expression variations","pose variations","interpersonal differences","intrapersonal variations","LFW databases","FRGC 2.0 databases","CAS-PERL-R1 databases","FERET databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","face image descriptors","face image representation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biometric Identification","Face","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Principal Component Analysis"]},{"kwd":["Face recognition","face image descriptors","face image representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Directional Multi-Level Dual-Cross Patterns for Robust Face Recognition","volume":"38","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7172530/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15755133","pubMedId":"27046495","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Projects","grantNumber":"DP-140102164 and FT-130101457"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science foundation","grantNumber":"IIS1262121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Directional Multi-Level Dual-Cross Patterns for Robust Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tpami-tao-2462338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116421S","chronDate":"March 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7398218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"230","xplore-issue":"7398218","articleId":"7172530","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172532,"authors":[{"name":"Osama Amin","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Science and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7172532/amin-2462802-small.gif","p":["\n\nOsama Amin (S'07\u2013M'11\u2013SM'15) received the B.Sc. degree in \nelectrical and electronics engineering from Aswan University, Aswan, Egypt, in 2000; the M.Sc. degree in electrical \nengineering from Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt, in 2004; and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering \nfrom the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2010.","In June 2012, he joined the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Assiut University, as an Assistant \nProfessor.

In this paper, we design an energy-efficient relay-assisted communication system based on estimated channel state information (CSI). It employs amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying and switches between different communication schemes, which are known as direct-transmission, two-hop, and cooperative-transmission schemes, using the estimated CSI to maximize EE. Two estimation strategies are assumed, namely, disintegrated channel estimation and cascaded channel estimation. To formulate an accurate EE metric for the proposed opportunistic AF (OAF) system, the channel estimation cost is reflected on the EE metric by including its impact in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) term and in the energy consumption during the channel estimation phase. Based on the formulated EE metric, we propose an adaptive power allocation algorithm to maximize the EE of the proposed OAF system with channel estimation. Furthermore, we study the impact of the estimation parameters on the proposed system via simulation examples.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Relays","Estimation","Resource management","Power demand","Measurement","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel estimation","cooperative communication","energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic energy-aware amplify-and-forward cooperative systems","imperfect CSI","wireless communication systems","energy efficiency metrics","energy consumption sources","channel state information","amplify-and-forward relaying","disintegrated channel estimation","cascaded channel estimation","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","channel estimation phase","adaptive power allocation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","cooperative communications","energy efficiency (EE)","estimated channel state information (CSI)","opportunistic relaying","power allocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2462802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07172532.pdf","startPage":"4875","endPage":"4886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2462802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Energy-Aware Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems With Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Energy-Aware Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems With Imperfect CSI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172532/","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172532/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16141202","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingName":"Discovery program"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation) under NPRP","grantNumber":"NPRP 5-250-2-087"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Energy-Aware Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems With Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tvt-amin-2462802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089293S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7172532","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7172533,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

During the peak PV generation period, the voltages are mitigated by charging the ESSs, and the stored energy is discharged for voltage support during the peak load period. The impact of storage devices integrated with the PV source on feeder voltages is investigated in detail. A coordinated control method, which includes distributed and localized controls, is proposed for distributed ESSs. The distributed control using the consensus algorithm regulates the feeder voltages within the required limits, while the localized control regulates the state of charge (SoC) of each ESS within the desired SoC range. The entire control structure ensures voltage regulation while effectively utilizing storage capacity under various operation conditions. The proposed control method is evaluated in LV distribution networks, and the simulation results validate the effectiveness of this method.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2462723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7475922/07172533.pdf","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2462723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Control of Distributed Energy-Storage Systems for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172533/","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Control of Distributed Energy-Storage Systems for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Networks","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16003723","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172533/","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Control of Distributed Energy-Storage Systems for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Networks","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-so-2462723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070406S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7475922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"7475922","articleId":"7172533","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7172535,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Golestan","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7172535/goles-small.gif","p":["Saeed Golestan (M\u201911\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Sc.\n degree in electrical engineering from Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree\n in electrical engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009.

In recent years, many approaches to generate the orthogonal signal have been proposed, the simplest perhaps being the transfer delay-based method. In the transfer delay-based PLL (TD-PLL), the orthogonal signal is generated by delaying the original single-phase signal by T/4 (one-quarter of a period). The phase shift caused by the transfer delay block, however, will not be exactly 90\u00b0 under off-nominal grid frequencies, which results in errors in the estimated quantities by the TD-PLL. To alleviate this issue, an improved version of TD-PLL, called the nonfrequency-dependent TD-PLL (NTD-PLL), has recently been proposed. The NTD-PLL uses another T/4 delay unit in its feedback path to make the PLL immune to grid frequency variations. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the accurate small-signal modeling of the TD-PLL and NTD-PLL has not yet been carried out, and no detailed analysis of their performance has been presented. The main aim of this paper is to address these issues and explore new methods to enhance their performance. The stability analysis, control design guidelines, and performance comparison with the state-of-the-art PLLs are presented as well.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2462082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7352399/07172535.pdf","startPage":"3517","endPage":"3527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2462082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-Signal Modeling, Stability Analysis and Design Optimization of Single-Phase Delay-Based PLLs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172535/","displayDocTitle":"Small-Signal Modeling, Stability Analysis and Design Optimization of Single-Phase Delay-Based PLLs","volume":"31","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15677498","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172535/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Programme on Microgrids, Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg university"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)","grantNumber":"DPI2012-31283"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Signal Modeling, Stability Analysis and Design Optimization of Single-Phase Delay-Based PLLs","sourcePdf":"tpel-golestan-2462082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1293S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7172535","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7172536,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Soroudi","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic, and Communications Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Alireza Soroudi (M\u201914) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Grenoble Institute of Technology, Grenoble, France, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently a Senior Researcher with the School of Electrical, Electronic, and Mechanical Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.

The proposed FDI method is simple with only one sliding-mode observer (SMO) equation and requires no additional transducers. The method is based on an SMO for the circulating current in an MMC. An open-circuit fault of power semiconductor device is detected when the observed circulating current diverges from the measured one. A fault is located by employing an assumption-verification process. To improve the robustness of the proposed FDI method, a new technique based on the observer injection term is introduced to estimate the value of the uncertainties and disturbances; this estimated value can be used to compensate the uncertainties and disturbances. As a result, the proposed FDI scheme can detect and locate an open-circuit fault in a power semiconductor device while ignoring parameter uncertainties, measurement error, and other bounded disturbances.

We present and discuss specifically two applications, magnetoelectric random access memory (MeRAM) and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM). The MEJ differs from a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) in that electric field is used to induce switching in lieu of substantial current flow in MTJ. Electric field control of magnetism can dramatically enhance the performance of magnetic memory devices in terms of switching energy efficiency and switching speed. The development of such an energy-efficient and ultrafast memory has a potential to change the paradigm of a hierarchical memory system in the conventional computer architecture. By combining speed, low power, and high density, electric-field-controlled magnetic memory merges features of multiple separate memory technologies used in today's memory hierarchy. The performance of a VCMA-MEJs-based MeRAM, especially in the case of one access transistor associated with one MEJ (1T-1R) structure, is evaluated by comparing it with that of phase-change RAM, resistive RAM, and spin transfer torque RAM. MeRAM can achieve ultrafast switching (<;1 ns), low switching energy (~1 fJ), and compact cell size of 6 F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n with a shared source region, as well as nonvolatility. For another application, we propose the VCMA-MEJ-based TCAM, which will be referred to as MeTCAM, consisting of 4T-2MEJs.

However, the conversion efficiency is degraded under light-load conditions due to the core loss in magnetic components and the switching loss in semiconductor devices. In this paper, a new control method is proposed for the FB LLC resonant converter. In the proposed method, the frequency control is basically used to regulate the output voltage over entire load conditions. Moreover, the proposed method utilizes phase-shifted gate signals between switch legs, based on predetermined optimal duty ratio under light-load conditions. At this point, the optimal duty ratio is determined to get minimum power loss under each light-load condition through the loss analysis of all components. Therefore, the proposed method makes high efficiency under light-load conditions. To confirm the validity of this paper, the prototype of the network power supply with 320-385 V dc input and 48 V/720 W dc output is tested.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7394209/07172545.pdf","startPage":"4942","endPage":"4955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2462077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2462077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on Load-Adaptive Phase-Shift Control for High Efficiency Full-Bridge <i>LLC</i> Resonant Converter Under Light-Load Conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Core loss","Voltage control","Frequency control","Logic gates","Rectifiers","Inductors","Magnetic cores"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","frequency control","load regulation","rectifiers","resonant power convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load-adaptive phase-shift control","high efficiency full-bridge LLC resonant converter","light-load conditions","zero-voltage switching","primary switches","rectifier diodes","core loss","magnetic components","semiconductor devices","frequency control","phase-shifted gate signals","optimal duty ratio","voltage 320 V to 385 V","voltage 48 V","power 720 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Core loss","light-load efficiency","LLC resonant converter","phase-shift control"]},{"kwd":["Core loss","light-load efficiency","LLC resonant converter","phase-shift control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis on Load-Adaptive Phase-Shift Control for High Efficiency Full-Bridge <i>LLC</i> Resonant Converter Under Light-Load Conditions","volume":"31","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7172545/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15754659","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2010-0028680"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis on Load-Adaptive Phase-Shift Control for High Efficiency Full-Bridge <italic>LLC</italic> Resonant Converter Under Light-Load Conditions","sourcePdf":"tpel-moon-2462077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109347S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7172545","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":7172550,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Byman","affiliation":["Bittium Wireless Ltd., Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7172550/byman-2462757-small.gif","p":["\n\nAaron Byman (M'04) received the B.S.E.E. degree from the University of \nWashington, Seattle, WA, USA, in 1999 and the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Oulu, Finland, in 2001.","From 2002 to 2014, he was with Elektrobit Ltd.

The physical layer is based on an enhanced version of the digital video broadcasting-satellite to handheld (DVB-SH) standard, exploiting dual-polarization multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology. This complete digital MIMO demonstrator, which is the first of its kind, allows for an in-depth verification and optimization of the MIMO techniques applied to satellite broadcasting networks. Moreover, this demonstrator allows for complementing and confirming the theoretical or simulation-based findings published thus far. It is shown that dual-polarization MIMO diversity is able to provide remarkable gains in terms of satellite/terrestrial transmit power reduction and/or capacity increase compared with more conventional non-MIMO solutions. It is also demonstrated that the adoption of a relatively simple spatial multiplexing MIMO technique represents the best way to grasp these gains. This paper provides an extensive set of laboratory measurement results for existing stochastic satellite and hybrid MIMO channels, as well as results based on an S-band satellite-measured dual-polarization time series recently collected during a campaign sponsored by the European Space Agency. Results obtained using MIMO techniques are also compared with a dual- and single-polarization single-input-single-output (SISO) DVB-SH benchmark system and with computer simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2462757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07172550.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2462757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","startPage":"4839","endPage":"4853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO for Mobile Satellite Digital Broadcasting: From Theory to Practice","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO for Mobile Satellite Digital Broadcasting: From Theory to Practice","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141205","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7172550/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO for Mobile Satellite Digital Broadcasting: From Theory to Practice","sourcePdf":"tvt-arapoglou-2462757-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164766S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7172550","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172552,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7300477/7172552/wang-2452579-small.gif","p":["Lei Wang received the M.Sc.Eng. degree in electrical utility engineering from Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia, in 2011.

Previous works on shadow detection put a lot of effort in designing shadow variant and invariant hand-crafted features. In contrast, our framework automatically learns the most relevant features in a supervised manner using multiple convolutional deep neural networks (ConvNets). The features are learned at the super-pixel level and along the dominant boundaries in the image. The predicted posteriors based on the learned features are fed to a conditional random field model to generate smooth shadow masks. Using the detected shadow masks, we propose a Bayesian formulation to accurately extract shadow matte and subsequently remove shadows. The Bayesian formulation is based on a novel model which accurately models the shadow generation process in the umbra and penumbra regions. The model parameters are efficiently estimated using an iterative optimization procedure. Our proposed framework consistently performed better than the state-of-the-art on all major shadow databases collected under a variety of conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2462355","startPage":"431","endPage":"446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2462355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7398218/07172555.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Shadow Detection and Removal from a Single Image","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172555/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Shadow Detection and Removal from a Single Image","volume":"38","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7172555/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15755134","pubMedId":"27046489","publicationDate":"1 March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IPRS"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001174","fundingName":"University of Western Australia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP110102166, DP150100294 and DE120102960"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Shadow Detection and Removal from a Single Image","sourcePdf":"tpami-khan-2462355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100882S","chronDate":"March 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7398218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"7398218","articleId":"7172555","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7172559,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, P.R.

For a given set of observed data corrupted with sparse errors, LRR aims at learning a lowest-rank representation of all data jointly. LRR has broad applications in pattern recognition, computer vision and signal processing. In the real world, data often reside on low-dimensional manifolds embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. However, the LRR method does not take into account the non-linear geometric structures within data, thus the locality and similarity information among data may be missing in the learning process. To improve LRR in this regard, we propose a general Laplacian regularized low-rank representation framework for data representation where a hypergraph Laplacian regularizer can be readily introduced into, i.e., a Non-negative Sparse Hyper-Laplacian regularized LRR model (NSHLRR). By taking advantage of the graph regularizer, our proposed method not only can represent the global low-dimensional structures, but also capture the intrinsic non-linear geometric information in data. The extensive experimental results on image clustering, semi-supervised image classification and dimensionality reduction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7398218/07172559.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laplacian Regularized Low-Rank Representation and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2462360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2462360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Laplacian Regularized Low-Rank Representation and Its Applications","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2016","publicationDate":"1 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15755135","pubMedId":"27046494","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7172559/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP130100364"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2013A06"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030313511"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation (NSF) of China","grantNumber":"61333013 and 61322306"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB352502"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation (NSF) of China","grantNumber":"61272341 and 61231002"},{"fundingName":"Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Research Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laplacian Regularized Low-Rank Representation and Its Applications","sourcePdf":"tpami-gao-2462360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149438S","chronDate":"March 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7398218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"7398218","articleId":"7172559","onlineDate":"29 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7172560,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongshun Shi","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhongshun","lastName":"Shi"},{"name":"Longfei Wang","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Longfei","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Pai Liu","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Pai","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Leyuan Shi","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Leyuan","lastName":"Shi"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5955"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3783"}],"articleNumber":"7172560","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Job shop scheduling","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Mixed integer linear programming","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer services","integer programming","linear programming","order processing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic algorithm","customer order scheduling problem","total weighted completion time","quadratic formulation","mixed-integer linear programming model","linearization technique","special structure","problem size","final linearized formulation","hybrid nested partitions algorithm","large-scale problems","reasonable computational time","completion time minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Completion time","hybrid nested partitions","linearization","order scheduling"]}],"abstract":"In this study, the customer order scheduling problem is investigated to minimize total weighted completion time.

Due to the randomness in renewable resources such as solar and wind, the power generated can deviate from forecasted values. This variation may cause increased operating costs for committing costly reserve units or penalty costs for shedding load. In addition, it is often desired to charge/discharge and coordinate the energy storage units in an efficient and economical way. To address these problems, a novel battery operation cost model is proposed which considers a battery as an equivalent fuel-run generator to enable it to be incorporated into a unit commitment problem. A probabilistic constrained approach is used to incorporate the uncertainties of the renewable sources and load demands into the unit commitment (UC) and economic dispatch

These devices are designed to integrate micro fluidics and embedded electronics using integrated 2D planar electrode arrays for applications in clinical diagnostics and point of care testing. Multiple Bioassay protocols are executed simultaneously within the same device and the resultant droplet is subjected for optical detection at dedicated detection sites within the chip area itself. Optical detection and analysis of samples within a DMFB are considered as major issues in terms of precision and accuracy. In this paper we proposed a design of an automated optical detection based analyzer that enables automated detection and analysis of the detected result with reference to a set of prespecified standard values already preloaded in the device memory. The analysis is enabled on multiple levels to ascertain the intensity of detection. The hardware simulation is carried out on FPGA platform and the test results obtained in the process are found to be in conformance with conventional laboratory procedure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Symposium on Electronic System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172584/7172585/07172750.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"78","publicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Symposium on Electronic System Design","doi":"10.1109/ISED.2014.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2014.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7172585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel Homogeneous Detection Analyzer for Medical Diagnostic Application in Digital Microfluidic Biochips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Biomedical optical imaging","Registers","Blood","Optical sensors","Sugar","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","biomedical electronics","bioMEMS","field programmable gate arrays","lab-on-a-chip","medical diagnostic computing","microfluidics","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel homogeneous detection analyzer","medical diagnostic application","digital microfluidic biochips","miniaturized platform","embedded electronics","integrated 2D planar electrode arrays","clinical diagnostics","point-of-care testing","multiple bioassay protocols","droplet","dedicated detection sites","automated optical detection","device memory","hardware simulation","FPGA platform","conventional laboratory procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Droplet detection","digital analyzer","photosensors","digital microfluidics","biochips","bioassay protocols","multilevel operation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Homogeneous Detection Analyzer for Medical Diagnostic Application in Digital Microfluidic Biochips","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172750/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15378457","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Homogeneous Detection Analyzer for Medical Diagnostic Application in Digital Microfluidic Biochips","confLoc":"Surathkal, India","sourcePdf":"6965a073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131213S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7172584","isNumber":"7172585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172584","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7172585","articleId":"7172750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7172756,"authors":[{"name":"Chikku Abraham","affiliation":["Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Chikku","lastName":"Abraham","id":"38187198000"},{"name":"R.

Integration on a single chip is facilitated as there are no magnetic components. A switched capacitor dc to dc converter circuit with two voltage levels as input, which can be converted to other voltage levels in buck or boost mode offering wide output voltage is presented in this work. The proposed circuit is capable of delivering 11 different output voltage levels from two input voltage levels, which includes summation of inputs, double and half output voltage levels. The novelty presented in the circuit is it uses only 9 switches, 2 charge pump capacitors and one filter capacitor to obtain the 11 gain modes. Further, an equivalent circuit model has been developed based on the differential charge theory and the mathematical equations are analyzed to obtain the optimum duty ratio at which the gating pulses to the switches are given. PSIM simulations validate the proposed circuit confirming the expected multiple output modes of the proposed circuit. This circuit can be used to power portable electronic devices and can be a potential driver for LED circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ISED.2014.29","publicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Symposium on Electronic System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Symposium on Electronic System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172584/7172585/07172756.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2014.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7172585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiple Input Multiple Output Switched Capacitor DC-DC Converter with Reduced Switch Count","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172756/","displayDocTitle":"A Multiple Input Multiple Output Switched Capacitor DC-DC Converter with Reduced Switch Count","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15378449","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7172756/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiple Input Multiple Output Switched Capacitor DC-DC Converter with Reduced Switch Count","confLoc":"Surathkal, India","sourcePdf":"6965a104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069115S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7172584","isNumber":"7172585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172584","xplore-issue":"7172585","articleId":"7172756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7172758,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Sabbavarapu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Sabbavarapu","id":"37085520555"},{"name":"Karunakar Reddy Basireddy","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, IN"],"firstName":"Karunakar Reddy","lastName":"Basireddy"},{"name":"Amit Acharyya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Acharyya","id":"37541105800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6965-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6964-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7172758","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Layout","Design automation","Algorithm design and analysis","Integrated circuits","DSL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","cost reduction","electronic design automation","integrated circuit design","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic library","IC design automation methodology","functional symmetry","NPN class representation approach","NRE cost reduction","time-to-market","electronic design automation","nonrecurring engineering","TTM","digital IC design","automation flow","register-transfer level","RTL description","negation-permutation-negation class representation","multiplier block","adder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic library","Dynamic Symbol Library","Dynamic Tech Library","Boolean matching","And-invert-graph (AIG)","Negation-permutation-negation class","functional symmetry","logic synthesis","physical design","cut enumeration"]}],"abstract":"Todays Electronic Design Automation industry is greatly affected by increased Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs and Time-to-Market (TTM) due to the incremental and iterative steps followed in the conventional digital IC design and automation flow. Reducing NRE cost and TTM at the same time is a daunting task to the research community without compromising on the performance. However, the complexity of hierarchical design steps can be reduced drastically by mapping the input register-transfer level (RTL) description directly to their corresponding physical designs stored in pre-computed technology libraries. We use the Dynamic Libraries, which store the layouts of the already designed blocks and their references for the later use in further designs which reduces the design time and design cost significantly. Further we have exploited the functional symmetry and negation-permutation negation (NPN) class representations to decoct the library size and number of comparisons to further improvise on design time which results in reduced TTM. The functional symmetry reduced the number of required pre-computed circuits in our experiments from 1031 to 222 (464.4% reduction in the memory size).

Maximum weight scheduling (MWS) is a well-known throughput optimal link scheduling algorithm. In addition to packet queue lengths, the algorithm needs to be aware of channel state information (CSI). However, perfect knowledge of channel state conditions is a very strong assumption in practical technologies. In this paper, the impact of CSI error on the performance of MWS algorithm is studied. We propose a throughput optimal link scheduling algorithm which is robust to CSI error. To consider CSI error, we propose an idea to use the state of battery at each node in order to estimate the amount of energy consumption per successful packet transmission. This information is used to revise MWS to the proposed algorithm termed as error robust energy aware scheduling (EREAS). We show that the EREAS outperforms MWS in terms of average number of failed transmissions and average delay in environments with high error probability. The theoretical results are confirmed by simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2463112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7286895/07172996.pdf","endPage":"6868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Aware Media Access Algorithm at the Presence of Channel State Information Error in Wireless Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2463112","startPage":"6861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Aware Media Access Algorithm at the Presence of Channel State Information Error in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7172996/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15489001","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7172996/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shahrekord University, Iran"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Aware Media Access Algorithm at the Presence of Channel State Information Error in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-ghiasian-2463112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074042S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7286895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"7286895","articleId":"7172996","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173003,"authors":[{"name":"Fotini Karinou","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, European Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Fotini Karinou received the Diploma in Electrical and Computer\n Engineering, with specialization in telecommunications and information theory, and the PhD degree in optical\n communications, from the University of Patras, Rio, Greece, in 2007, and 2012, respectively.

We prove that the proposed technology is an enabler for next-generation 100-G cost-efficient point-to-point dispersion compensation fiber (DCF)-free metro networks up to 80 km, as well as for multispan metro-ring networks up to 400 km, consisting of cascaded erbium-doped fiber amplifiers and DCFs as in real-field implementations. Key techniques to enable transmission are the employment of signal predistortion in the transmitter to compensate for the components' limited bandwidth, a maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE)-based receiver, and a high-performance sampling phase adjustment algorithm. Furthermore, we show that performance can be optimized, while at the same time the complexity of the electronic dispersion compensation part is significantly reduced by exploiting a simplified variant of MLSE that makes use of a reduced number of states. Results in this paper reveal the potentiality of our proposed scheme for a low-cost transition to 100 Gb/s ( $4 \\times 28$ Gb/s) wavelength division multiplexed, point-to-point, metro-core, and multispan metro-ring networks, employing inexpensive optical components and the traditional cost-efficient IM/DD scheme.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173003","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Maximum likelihood estimation","Receivers","Bandwidth","Clocks","Signal to noise ratio","Optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","intensity modulation","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","metropolitan area networks","next generation networks","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre communication","optical information processing","optical links","optical receivers","optical transmitters","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metro-core networks","point-to-point metro-ring networks","wavelength division multiplexed networks","electronic dispersion compensation","high-performance sampling phase adjustment algorithm","transmitter","signal predistortion","cascaded erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","multispan metro-ring networks","dispersion compensation fiber","next-generation cost-efficient point-to-point DCF-free metro networks","uncompensated fiber links","digital signal processing","optical components","maximum likelihood sequence estimator","MLSE receiver","DD","direct detection","IM","intensity modulation","cost-efficient 100G metro networks","bandwidth 10 GHz","bit rate 28 Gbit/s","bit rate 100 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Metropolitan area networks","maximum likelihood detection","optical fiber communication","optical fiber networks","chromatic dispersion","direct detection","digital signal processing"]},{"kwd":["Chromatic dispersion","direct detection","digital signal processing","metropolitan area networks","maximum likelihood detection","optical fiber communication","optical fiber networks"]}],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7225204/07173003.pdf","startPage":"4109","endPage":"4117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2463080","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2463080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Cost-Efficient 100G Metro Networks Using IM/DD, 10-GHz Components, and MLSE Receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1, 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173003/","displayDocTitle":"Toward Cost-Efficient 100G Metro Networks Using IM/DD, 10-GHz Components, and MLSE Receiver","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2015","publicationDate":"1 Oct.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15430431","htmlLink":"/document/7173003/","volume":"33","issue":"19","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Cost-Efficient 100G Metro Networks Using IM/DD, 10-GHz Components, and MLSE Receiver","sourcePdf":"jlt-karinou-2463080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05841S","chronDate":"Oct.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7225204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7225204","articleId":"7173003","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173010,"authors":[{"name":"Yanina Y.

The message set of a UMP code is a union of m disjoint message classes. Each class has its own error protection requirement, with some classes needing better error protection than others. We analyze the tradeoff between rates of message classes and the levels of error protection; our analysis reveals new tradeoffs, which were not captured by prior works on UMP codes. To obtain our results, we generalize finite block length achievability and converse bounds due to Polyanskiy-Poor-Verd\u00fa. We evaluate our bounds for the binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, and analyze the asymptotic characteristic of the bounds in the fixed error and moderate deviations regimes. In addition, we consider two questions related to the practical construction of UMP codes. First, we study a header construction that prefixes the message class into a header followed by data protection using a standard homogeneous (classical) code. We show that, in general, this construction is not optimal at finite block lengths. We further demonstrate that our main UMP achievability bound can be obtained using coset codes, which suggests a path to implementation of tractable UMP codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7258415/07173010.pdf","startPage":"5396","endPage":"5416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2462846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2462846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal Message Protection: Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Tradeoffs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manganese","Error probability","Error correction codes","Channel coding","Joints","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","codes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal message protection","non-asymptotic tradeoffs","unequal error protection","Polyanskiy-Poor-Verd\u00fa","binary symmetric channels","binary erasure channels","UMP codes"]},{"kwd":["Channel Coding","Finite block length analysis","Moderate deviations","Dispersion","Unequal error protection","Unequal message protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Unequal Message Protection: Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Tradeoffs","volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7173010/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15439869","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation CAREER","grantNumber":"CCF 0844539"},{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences Engineering Research Council through a Discovery Grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001352","fundingName":"National University of Singapore (NUS)","grantNumber":"R-263-000-A98-750/133"},{"fundingName":"NUS Young Investigator Award","grantNumber":"R-263-000-B37-133"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal Message Protection: Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Tradeoffs","sourcePdf":"tit-shkel-2462846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123061S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7258415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7258415","articleId":"7173010","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173020,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel Abbe","affiliation":["Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Emmanuel Abbe received his Ph.D. from the EECS Department at MIT in 2008 and his M.S. from the Mathematics Department at EPFL in 2003.

Necessarily, this paper also studies the properties of evaluations of multivariate GF(2) polynomials on the random sets of inputs. For erasures, we prove that RM codes achieve capacity both for very high rate and very low rate regimes. For errors, we prove that RM codes achieve capacity for very low rate regimes, and for very high rates, we show that they can uniquely decode at about the square root of the number of errors at capacity. The proofs of these four results are based on different techniques, which we find interesting in their own right. In particular, we study the following questions about E(m, r), the matrix whose rows are the truth tables of all the monomials of degree \u2264 r in m variables. What is the most (resp. least) number of random columns in E(m, r) that define a submatrix having full column rank (resp. full row rank) with high probability? We obtain tight bounds for very small (resp. very large) degrees r, which we use to show that RM codes achieve capacity for erasures in these regimes. Our decoding from random errors follows from the following novel reduction. For every linear code C of sufficiently high rate, we construct a new code C' obtained by tensorizing C, such that for every subset S of coordinates, if C can recover from erasures in S, then C' can recover from errors in S. Specializing this to the RM codes and using our results for erasures imply our result on the unique decoding of the RM codes at high rate. Finally, two of our capacity achieving results require tight bounds on the weight distribution of RM codes. We obtain such bounds extending the recent bounds from constant degree to linear degree polynomials.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2462817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7258415/07173020.pdf","startPage":"5229","endPage":"5252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2462817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reed\u2013Muller Codes for Random Erasures and Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173020/","displayDocTitle":"Reed\u2013Muller Codes for Random Erasures and Errors","volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15439870","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7173020/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CFF-1319299"},{"fundingName":"European Community\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)","grantNumber":"257575"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"339/10"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"NSF through the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations","grantNumber":"CCF-1412958 and CIF-1706648"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reed\u2013Muller Codes for Random Erasures and Errors","sourcePdf":"tit-abbe-2462817-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14781S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7258415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7258415","articleId":"7173020","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7173021,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Min Pak","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7287829/7173021/jmpak-2462771-small.gif","p":["Jung Min Pak received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006, 2008, and 2015, respectively.","Since 2015, he has been a Postdoctoral Researcher with the School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University.

Accurate localization in cluttered and noisy environments is commonly provided by means of a mathematical algorithm referred to as a state estimator or filter. The particle filter (PF), which is the most commonly used filter in localization, suffers from the sample impoverishment problem under typical conditions of real-time localization based on WSNs. This paper proposes a novel hybrid particle/finite impulse response (FIR) filtering algorithm for improving reliability of PF-based localization schemes under harsh conditions causing sample impoverishment. The hybrid particle/FIR filter detects the PF failures and recovers the failed PF by resetting the PF using the output of an auxiliary FIR filter. Combining the regularized particle filter (RPF) and the extended unbiased FIR (EFIR) filter, the hybrid RP/EFIR filter is constructed in this paper. Through simulations, the hybrid RP/EFIR filter demonstrates its improved reliability and ability to recover the RPF from failures.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2462771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2462771","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7287829/07173021.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Reliability of Particle Filter-Based Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks via Hybrid Particle/FIR Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving Reliability of Particle Filter-Based Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks via Hybrid Particle/FIR Filtering","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15489126","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7173021/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"General Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A1A2008698"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A1006101"},{"fundingName":"Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP)","grantNumber":"20154030200610"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering under the Newton Research Collaboration Programme","grantNumber":"NRCP/1415/140"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Reliability of Particle Filter-Based Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks via Hybrid Particle/FIR Filtering","sourcePdf":"tii-ahn-2462771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149751S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7287829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"7287829","articleId":"7173021","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7173028,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy Hussein","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7317673/7173028/husse-2454651-small.gif","p":["Ramy Hussein (S\u201914) was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1988.

PD measurements, however, are corrupted with different types of noises such as white noise, random noise, and discrete spectral interferences. Hence, the denoising of such corrupted PD signals remains a challenging problem in PD signal detection and classification. The challenge lies in removing these noises from the online PD signal measurements effectively, while retaining its discriminant features and characteristics. In this paper, wavelet-based denoising with a new histogram-based threshold function and selection rule is proposed. The proposed threshold estimation technique obtains two different threshold values for each wavelet sub-band and uses a prodigious thresholding function that conserves the original signal energy. Moreover, two signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation techniques are derived to fit with actual PD signals corrupted with real noise. The proposed technique is applied on different acoustic and current measured PD signals to examine its performance under different noisy environments. The simulation results confirm the merits of the proposed denoising technique compared with other existing wavelet-based techniques by measuring four evaluation metrics: 1) SNR; 2) cross-correlation coefficient; 3) mean square error; and 4) reduction in noise level.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2015.2454651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7317673/07173028.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2015.2454651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317673","startPage":"3601","endPage":"3614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Transform With Histogram-Based Threshold Estimation for Online Partial Discharge Signal Denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Transform With Histogram-Based Threshold Estimation for Online Partial Discharge Signal Denoising","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583782","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7173028/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP 5-044-2-016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Transform With Histogram-Based Threshold Estimation for Online Partial Discharge Signal Denoising","sourcePdf":"tim-hussein-2454651-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09588S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7317673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7317673","articleId":"7173028","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173030,"authors":[{"name":"Jingook Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7203174/7173030/kim-2450723-small.gif","p":["Jingook Kim (M\u201909) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejon, Korea, in 2000, 2002, and 2006, respectively.","He was with the DRAM Design Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, Korea, as a Senior Engineer, from 2006 to 2008.

A silicon integrated circuit (IC) is designed, fabricated, and assembled on a manufactured printed circuit board (PCB). The supply voltage fluctuations on the IC with regard to the receiver reference voltage are extracted from measurements at the IC and PCB. Also, the impulse response of the total output channel is extracted from the measurements of the driver and channel characteristics.

The GEF consists of three stages: (1) age grouping; (2) age estimation within age groups; and (3) decision fusion for final age estimation. In the first stage, faces are classified into different groups, where each group has a different age range. In the second stage, three methods are adopted to extract global features from the whole face and local features from facial components (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth). Each global or local feature is individually utilized for age estimation in each group. Thus, several decisions (i.e., estimation results) are derived. In the third stage, we obtain the final estimated age by fusing the diverse decisions from the second stage. To create diverse decisions for fusion, we investigate multiple age grouping systems in the first stage, where each system has a different number of groups and different age ranges. Thus, various decisions can be made from the second stage, and will be delivered to the third stage for fusion. Totally, six fusion schemes (i.e., intra-system fusion, inter-system fusion, intra-inter fusion, inter-intra fusion, maximum-diversity fusion, and composite fusion) are developed and compared. The performance of the GEF system is evaluated on the Face and Gesture Recognition Research Network and the MORPH-II databases, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art age estimation methods by a significant margin. That is, the mean absolute errors of age estimation are reduced from 4.48 to 2.81 years on FG-NET and 3.82 to 2.97 years on MORPH-II.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Age Estimation via Grouping and Decision Fusion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2462732","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7235010/07173035.pdf","startPage":"2408","endPage":"2423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2462732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7235010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173035/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Age Estimation via Grouping and Decision Fusion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7173035/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15451723","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age Estimation via Grouping and Decision Fusion","sourcePdf":"tifs-liu-2462732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15545S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7235010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7235010","articleId":"7173035","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173039,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Seiler","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich\u2013Alexander\u2013Universit\u00e4t Erlangen\u2013N\u00fcrnberg, Cauerstr. 7, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7131605/7173039/seile-2463084-small.gif","p":["J\u00fcrgen Seiler (M\u201909) received the Diploma degree in electrical engineering, electronics and information technology and the Ph.D. degree from Friedrich\u2013Alexander-Universtit\u00e4t Erlangen\u2013N\u00fcrnberg, Germany, in 2006 and 2011, respectively, where he is currently a Senior Scientist and Lecturer with the Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing.","He received the Dissertation Award of the Information Technology Society of the German Electrical Engineering Association and the Dissertation Award of the Staedtler-Foundation, in 2012.

In such a case, a resampling of the image to a regular grid has to be carried out. This is necessary since almost all algorithms and technologies for processing, transmitting or displaying image signals rely on the samples being available on a regular grid. Thus, it is of great importance to reconstruct the image on this regular grid, so that the reconstruction comes closest to the case that the signal has been originally acquired on the regular grid. In this paper, Frequency Selective Reconstruction is introduced for solving this challenging task. This algorithm reconstructs image signals by exploiting the property that small areas of images can be represented sparsely in the Fourier domain. By further considering the basic properties of the optical transfer function of imaging systems, a sparse model of the signal is iteratively generated. In doing so, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve a very high reconstruction quality, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity measure as well as in terms of visual quality. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms and gains of more than 1 dB PSNR are possible.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2463084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2463084","startPage":"4540","endPage":"4555","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7131605/07173039.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resampling Images to a Regular Grid From a Non-Regular Subset of Pixel Positions Using Frequency Selective Reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Resampling Images to a Regular Grid From a Non-Regular Subset of Pixel Positions Using Frequency Selective Reconstruction","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2015","volume":"24","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7173039/","accessionNumber":"15410157","pubMedId":"26259243","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173039/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resampling Images to a Regular Grid From a Non-Regular Subset of Pixel Positions Using Frequency Selective Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tip-seiler-2463084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102918S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7131605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7131605","articleId":"7173039","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7173041,"authors":[{"name":"Shaomiao Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering of Hunan University, National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7469437/7173041/chen-2462835-small.gif","p":["Shaomiao Chen received the MSc degree in computer science and\n technology from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2014.

In this paper, the problem is defined as energy-constrained performance optimization and performance-constrained energy optimization. Task scheduling for precedence-constrained parallel applications represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in HMCSs is an NP-HARD problem. Over the last three decades, several task scheduling techniques have been developed for energy-aware scheduling. However, it is impossible for a single task scheduling technique to outperform all other techniques for all types of applications and situations. Motivated by these observations, hyperheuristic framework is introduced. Moreover, a quantum-inspired high-level learning strategy is proposed to improve the performance of this framework. Meanwhile, a fast solution evaluation technique is designed to reduce the computational burden for each iteration step. Experimental results show that the fast solution evaluation technique can improve average algorithm search speed by 38 percent and that the proposed algorithm generally exhibits outstanding convergence performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2015.2462835","startPage":"1796","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7469437/07173041.pdf","endPage":"1810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2015.2462835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173041/","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-Inspired Hyper-Heuristics for Energy-Aware Scheduling on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","volume":"27","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7173041/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16023113","publicationDate":"1 June 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61173107"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2012AA01A301-01"},{"fundingName":"Special Project on the Integration of Industry, Education and Research of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2012A090300003"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2013B090700003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-Inspired Hyper-Heuristics for Energy-Aware Scheduling on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-chen-2462835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176218S","chronDate":"June 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7469437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7469437","articleId":"7173041","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7173042,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo-Yue Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7203174/7173042/li-2452578-small.gif","p":["Zhuo-Yue Li received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology.","His current research interests include signal integrity and package design optimization."]},"firstName":"Zhuo-Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37085439949"},{"name":"Mu-Shui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7203174/7173042/zhang-2452578-small.gif","p":["Mu-Shui Zhang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He has been a Faculty Member with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, since 2009, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

symptoms in several musculoskeletal and neurological conditions, severely limiting personal autonomy. Wearable gait sensors have been attracting attention as diagnostic tool for gait and are emerging as promising tool for tutoring and guiding gait execution. If their popularity is continuously growing, still there is room for improvement, especially towards more accurate solutions for spatio-temporal gait parameters estimation. We present an implementation of a zero-velocity-update gait analysis system based on a Kalman filter and off-the-shelf shoe-worn inertial sensors. The algorithms for gait events and step length estimation were specifically designed to comply with pathological gait patterns. More so, an Android app was deployed to support fully wearable and stand-alone real-time gait analysis. Twelve healthy subjects were enrolled to preliminarily tune the algorithms; afterwards sixteen persons with Parkinson's disease were enrolled for a validation study. Over the 1314 strides collected on patients at three different speeds, the total root mean square difference on step length estimation between this system and a gold standard was 2.9%. This shows that the proposed method allows for an accurate gait analysis and paves the way to a new generation of mobile devices usable anywhere for monitoring and intervention.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2457511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2457511","startPage":"764","endPage":"773","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/7508513/07173053.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7508513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mobile Kalman-Filter Based Solution for the Real-Time Estimation of Spatio-Temporal Gait Parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Mobile Kalman-Filter Based Solution for the Real-Time Estimation of Spatio-Temporal Gait Parameters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2016","volume":"24","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7173053/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"16139266","pubMedId":"26259246","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173053/","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Mobile Kalman-Filter Based Solution for the Real-Time Estimation of Spatio-Temporal Gait Parameters","sourcePdf":"tnsre-ferrari-2457511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098548S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"7508513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7508513","articleId":"7173053","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7173062,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Kang Liu","affiliation":["Institute for Sustainable Manufacturing and Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7963895/7173062/7173062-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["YuKang Liu received the B.Eng. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2009, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA, in 2012 and 2014, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He is now with the MathWorks, Inc., working on solver performance and hybrid system simulation.

In this paper, human welder's response against 3-D weld pool surface is learned and transferred to the welding robots to perform automated welding tasks. To this end, an innovative teleoperated virtualized welding platform is utilized to conduct dynamic training experiments by a human welder whose arm movements together with the 3-D weld pool characteristic parameters are recorded. The data is off-line rated by the welder and a fuzzy classifier is trained, using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), to automate the rating. Data from the training experiments are then automatically classified such that top rated data pairs are selected to model and extract \u201cgood response\u201d minimizing the effect from \u201cbad operation\u201d made during the training. A supervised ANFIS model is then proposed to correlate the 3-D weld pool characteristic parameters and welder's adjustment on the welding speed. The obtained model is then transferred to the welding robot to perform automated welding task as an intelligent controller. Experiment results verified that the proposed model is able to control the process under different welding current as well as under disturbances in speed and measurement. A foundation is thus established to selectively learn \u201cgood response\u201d to rapidly extract human intelligence to transfer into welding robots.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7963895/07173062.pdf","startPage":"1532","endPage":"1541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2015.2453351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2015.2453351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Learning of Human Welder Behaviors for Intelligent Robotic Welding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Welding","Service robots","Training","Process control","Data models","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy reasoning","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","robotic welding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised learning","human welder behavior","intelligent robotic welding","industrial welding robot","intelligence skilled human welders","human welder response","3D weld pool surface","automated welding","innovative teleoperated virtualized welding platform","dynamic training","fuzzy classifier","adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system","supervised ANFIS model","intelligent controller","human intelligence extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ANFIS","fuzzy classification","GTAW","3-D weld pool surface","virtualized welding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Learning of Human Welder Behaviors for Intelligent Robotic Welding","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7173062/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17012808","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Learning of Human Welder Behaviors for Intelligent Robotic Welding","sourcePdf":"tase-zhang-2453351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070882S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7963895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7963895","articleId":"7173062","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7173063,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzhong Gong","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7453237/7173063/7173063-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuzhong Gong (S'13) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, in 2010.

Conventional thermal or hydro units have to be dispatched, shut down or started up more frequently to keep the balance between generation and load. This paper proposes a wind power ramp control method with energy storage system (ESS) based on wind power ramp event forecast. An optimization model is established to optimize the output power of ESS and the wind curtailment to meet a hybrid wind power ramp limit. Three types of wind power ramp scenarios are presented based on the ramp event forecast, including normal scenario, positive ramp scenarios, and negative ramp scenarios. In each scenario, the optimization model is modified with scenario switching adjustment (SSA) to reduce the capacity demand of ESS and the curtailed wind energy. While the parameters for modification are obtained by different fuzzy logic systems (FLS). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed wind power ramp control method is verified through case studies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7453237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2445382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7453237/07173063.pdf","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1844","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2445382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ramp Event Forecast Based Wind Power Ramp Control With Energy Storage System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"Ramp Event Forecast Based Wind Power Ramp Control With Energy Storage System","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7173063/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935181","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ramp Event Forecast Based Wind Power Ramp Control With Energy Storage System","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-jiang-2445382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093762S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7453237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7453237","articleId":"7173063","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7173064,"authors":[{"name":"Changbyung Park","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea","KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7368951/7173064/7173064-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changbyung Park received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2008, 2010, and 2015, respectively.","He is currently working in Digital Media and Communication R&D center, Samsung electronics, Suwon, Korea.

The proposed system detects the location of the ECR pen and finger using proposed position sensor, and senses pen-pressure of ECR pen using proposed pen-pressure sensor. For the position sensor, to detect even small variation of the mutual capacitance on touch screen panel (TSP) of the pen, a simultaneous driving scheme is proposed with modified Hadamard matrix, resulting in highly increased dynamic range and SNR. In the proposed pen-pressure sensor, the resonant frequency of the ECR pen is measured by a frequency to voltage converter based sensor. The measured SNR for the pen position is 49 dB with 1 mm \u03c6 metal pillar, and 6.5-bit resolution is achieved for pen-pressure sensor in 6\u03c3 criteria.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2453943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7368951/07173064.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2453943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7368951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pen-Pressure-Sensitive Capacitive Touch System Using Electrically Coupled Resonance Pen","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173064/","displayDocTitle":"A Pen-Pressure-Sensitive Capacitive Touch System Using Electrically Coupled Resonance Pen","volume":"51","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15694971","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7173064/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pen-Pressure-Sensitive Capacitive Touch System Using Electrically Coupled Resonance Pen","sourcePdf":"jssc-park-2453943-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111078S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7368951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7368951","articleId":"7173064","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7173119,"authors":[{"name":"Rodney Waterhouse","affiliation":["Pharad, LLC, Hanover, Maryland, USA"],"firstName":"Rodney","lastName":"Waterhouse","id":"37280476200"},{"name":"Dalma Novack","affiliation":["Pharad, LLC, Hanover, Maryland, USA"],"firstName":"Dalma","lastName":"Novack","id":"37085643913"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"7173119","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4054},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","5G mobile communication","Optical fiber networks","Microwave photonics","Optical fiber devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","microwave photonics","millimetre waves","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile wireless system","microwave photonic technique","5G cellular network","millimeter-wave spectrum","mmwave spectrum","multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO system","mobile base station","disruptive technology"]}],"abstract":"This article looks at the role that photonics, particularly microwave photonics, can play in realizing 5G networks.

Satellite communication offers a number of distinct features that are not readily available with other means of communication, such as seamless coverage of remote and sparsely populated areas, reliable data relay for deep-space exploration, inherent multicasting and broadcasting capabilities, and reliable performance in extreme conditions (e.g., war, earthquakes, and other adverse events) [1], [2]. In recent years, the steep rise in mobile multimedia applications and increased space exploration activity have created unprecedented opportunities for innovative satellite communication. According to a report provided by the Satellite Industry Association in September 2014, the global revenue of the satellite communication industry for 2013 reached US$189.2 billion-60% of global space revenue and 4% of global telecommunications revenue [3]. Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and many other large technology companies are currently seeking to bolster their satellite communication systems in the next five to ten years, fostering a continuous increase of revenue in this area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satellite Payloads Pay Off","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2015.2441619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6668/7173098/07173126.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2015.2441619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Satellite Payloads Pay Off","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7173126/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15342461","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satellite Payloads Pay Off","sourcePdf":"16mmm08-pan-2441619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.222638S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"7173098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"7173098","articleId":"7173126","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173150,"authors":[{"name":"Stavros Iezekiel","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Stavros","lastName":"Iezekiel","id":"37085556976"},{"name":"Maurizio Burla","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique-Energie, Materiaux et Telecommunications, Varennes, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Burla","id":"37590120500"},{"name":"Jonathan Klamkin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Boston University, Massachusetts, United States"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Klamkin","id":"37270647100"},{"name":"David Marpaung","affiliation":["Centre for Ultrahigh Bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Marpaung","id":"37296951600"},{"name":"Jose Capmany","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Ciudad Politecnica de la Innovacion, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Capmany","id":"37277073500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"7173150","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"abstract":"Integrated microwave photonics (IMWP) is concerned with applying integrated photonics technology to microwave photonic systems.

The data exchanged between nodes and base station are vulnerable to corruption by errors induced by random noise, signal fading and other factors. In this regard, error control coding (ECC) is an efficient technique used to increase link reliability and to reduce the required transmitted power. In this context, the choice of energy efficient ECC with a suitable modulation scheme is a crucial task at the link and physical layer of wireless sensor networks to improve their lifetime. Since the WSNs are energy constraint in nature, both the probability of bit error rate (BER) and power consumption have to be taken into account. A performance analysis of error control coding schemes referring to BPSK modulation through a Gaussian channel (AWGN) is presented in this paper. Our results show that the RS(31,21) outperforms other ECC schemes and can be the optimal choice for wireless sensor network environment.","doi":"10.1109/RAWSN.2015.7173277","publicationTitle":"2015 Third International Workshop on RFID And Adaptive Wireless Sensor Networks (RAWSN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Third International Workshop on RFID And Adaptive Wireless Sensor Networks (RAWSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7164233/7173261/07173277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAWSN.2015.7173277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173261","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of efficient coding schemes for wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of efficient coding schemes for wireless sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173277/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15345640","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7173277/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of efficient coding schemes for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Agadir, Morocco","sourcePdf":"7Paper28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069034S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164233","isNumber":"7173261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164233","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7173261","articleId":"7173277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7173286,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this paper, we are interested in finding the optimal spectrum to be allocated to users in cognitive radio networks by ensuring quality of service satisfying. The problem is started by studying the possibility of using genetic algorithm (GA) to accommodate the secondary users in best possible space in the spectrum by interacting with the dynamic radio environment. The main advantage of GA over other soft computing techniques is its multi-objective handling capability. The cognitive radio will sense the radio frequency parameter from the environment and the reasoning engine in the cognitive radio will take the required decisions in order to provide new spectrum allocation as demanded by the user. GA defines a radio in the form of chromosomes and genes and the user's quality of service needs are given as input to the GA procedure. We analyze the impact of both parameters, available spectrum resources size which is defined by the GA as a population size, and the number of defined chromosome's genes in the efficiency of spectrum allocation. The performance analysis results are showed in Matlab.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15345625","htmlLink":"/document/7173287/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum allocation using genetic algorithm in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum allocation using genetic algorithm in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Agadir, Morocco","sourcePdf":"7Paper46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044131S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7164233","isNumber":"7173261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7164233","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7173261","articleId":"7173287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7173338,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Melanoma is usually present and manifests itself with changes in color, size, contour and configuration, or may occur as new pigmented lesions. In particular, melanoma represents the sixth leading cause of malignancy in the United States with much higher mortality rate among non-Caucasian population, although is more common among whites. Considering its complexity, clinical diagnosis of melanoma is challenging even for experienced dermatologists. This is why it is necessary to develop computer assisted diagnostic tool for melanoma detection focused on dark and fair complexion skin which adds more objective judgments based on quantitative measures. Therefore, specialized algorithms were developed and tested utilizing databases including images of a variety of skin cancer manifestations. Those diagnostic indicators were assessed utilizing commonly used ABCDE criteria for different skin complexions and also natural and simulated darker background reflecting darker skin tones associated with different ethnic groups.

The purpose of this work is to develop a power meter which can measure the forward and reflected power of ultrasound transducers and calculate the Standing Wave Ratio with the finality to avoid damage at the excitation device.","doi":"10.1109/PAHCE.2015.7173353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAHCE.2015.7173353","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Pan American Health Care Exchanges (PAHCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7159925/7173301/07173353.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 Pan American Health Care Exchanges (PAHCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power meter for HIFU transducers using logarithmic amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Power meter for HIFU transducers using logarithmic amplifiers","conferenceDate":"23-28 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7173353/","accessionNumber":"15400295","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173353/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power meter for HIFU transducers using logarithmic amplifiers","confLoc":"Santiago, Chile","sourcePdf":"147EB.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054437S","chronDate":"23-28 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7159925","isNumber":"7173301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7159925","xplore-issue":"7173301","articleId":"7173353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7173372,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed separable filtering approach is significantly faster and occupied few resources in terms of number of clock cycles and number of multipliers compared to the general two-dimensional convolution implementation.

By letting each distributed generator (DG) share the compensation effort cooperatively, unbalanced voltage in sensitive load bus (SLB) can be compensated. The concept of contribution level (CL) for compensation is first proposed for each local DG to indicate its compensation ability. A two-layer secondary compensation architecture consisting of a communication layer and a compensation layer is designed for each local DG. A totally distributed strategy involving information sharing and exchange is proposed, which is based on finite-time average consensus and newly developed graph discovery algorithm. This strategy does not require the whole system structure as a prior and can detect the structure automatically. The proposed scheme not only achieves similar VUC performance to the centralized one, but also brings some advantages, such as communication fault tolerance and plug-and-play property. Case studies including communication failure, CL variation, and DG plug-and-play are discussed and tested to validate the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2462773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7287829/07173420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2462773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287829","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Cooperative Secondary Control for Voltage Unbalance Compensation in an Islanded Microgrid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Cooperative Secondary Control for Voltage Unbalance Compensation in an Islanded Microgrid","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15489130","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7173420/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major State Basic Research Development","grantNumber":"2012CB215202 and 2014CB249200"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61134001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"Singapore\u2019s National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"NRF-CRP8-2011-03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006512","fundingName":"Energy Research Institute@NTU (ERI@N)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Cooperative Secondary Control for Voltage Unbalance Compensation in an Islanded Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tii-song-2462773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125957S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7287829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7287829","articleId":"7173420","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7173424,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7173424/zwang-2462847_print-small.gif","p":["\nZhe Wang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and business administration (minor) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, in 2015.","His research interests are in the areas of modulation techniques for wireless communications, energy management for smart grid system, and optimization for green communications."]},"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"38007247700"},{"name":"Vaneet Aggarwal","affiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7173424/aggar-2462847_print-small.gif","p":["\nVaneet Aggarwal (S'08\u2013M'11\u2013SM'15) received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, in 2005 and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

We assume that the energy harvesting state and channel gain of each transmitter can be predicted for K time slots a priori. To maximize the weighted throughput, we formulate an optimization problem with O(MK) constraints, where M is the total number of receivers, and optimize over the energy and bandwidth allocation variables. To solve the problem efficiently, an iterative algorithm is proposed that alternatively solves the two subproblems of energy allocation and bandwidth allocation in each iteration. We show that this algorithm converges to the optimal solution. Also, we propose efficient algorithms to solve the two subproblems, so that the optimal energy-bandwidth allocation can be obtained with an overall complexity of O(MK\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), even though the problem is non-convex when the broadcast channel is non-orthogonal. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can make efficient use of the harvested energy and the available bandwidth, and achieve significantly better performance as compared to some heuristic policies for energy and bandwidth allocation. Moreover, it is seen that with energy-harvesting transmitters, the non-orthogonal broadcast channel offers limited gain over the orthogonal broadcast channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Energy-Bandwidth Allocation in Multiple Broadcast Channels With Energy Harvesting","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2462847","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07173424.pdf","startPage":"3842","endPage":"3855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2462847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Energy-Bandwidth Allocation in Multiple Broadcast Channels With Energy Harvesting","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7173424/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524658","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CCF-1526215"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Energy-Bandwidth Allocation in Multiple Broadcast Channels With Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2462847-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097379S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7173424","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173425,"authors":[{"name":"Mattia Ricco","affiliation":["Laboratory of Systems and Applications of Information and Energy Technologies, Universit de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7851099/7173425/ricco-2462313-small.gif","p":["Mattia Ricco received the Master\u2019s degree (cum laude) in electronic engineering from the University of Salerno, Fisciano, Italy, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France, and in information engineering from the University of Salerno, in 2015.","His research interests include design and implementation in field programmable gate arrary (FPGA) devices, digital controllers and identification algorithms for power electronics, and photovoltaic systems."]},"firstName":"Mattia","lastName":"Ricco","id":"37085708345"},{"name":"Patrizio Manganiello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, Ingegneria Elettrica e Matematica Applicata, Universit di Salerno, Fisciano, Italy","Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell\u2019Informazione, Seconda Universit degli Studi di Napoli, Aversa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7851099/7173425/manga-2462313-small.gif","p":["Patrizio Manganiello received the Master\u2019s degree (cum laude) in electronic engineering from the University of Salerno, Fisciano, Italy, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in energy conversion from the Second University of Naples, Caserta, Italy, in 2014.","His research interests include analysis, design, and control of switching converters for renewable energy source, as well as the on-line diagnostics of the whole energy conversion system by means of linear and nonlinear identification techniques."]},"firstName":"Patrizio","lastName":"Manganiello","id":"37085698547"},{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["Laboratory of Systems and Applications of Information and Energy Technologies, Universit de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7851099/7173425/monma-2462313-small.gif","p":["Eric Monmasson (M\u201996\u2013SM\u201906) received the Ing. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieurs d\u2019Electrotechnique d\u2019Electronique d\u2019Informatique et d\u2019Hydraulique de Toulouse (ENSEEIHT), Toulouse, France, in 1989 and 1993, respectively.","He is currently a Full Professor with the University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France.

However, ATC tests are quite time-consuming and can take more than a month to complete. Hence, its efficiency has become an important issue. The parameters of the ATC test, such as temperature ramp rate and dwell time, significantly influence fatigue failure in solder joints. Fast temperature cycles can reduce the testing time, but the effects of ramp rate cause variations in solder joints' material properties and mechanics behavior due to strain rates and stress changes. Commonly used lead-free materials with high homologous temperatures induce creep-related solder joint failures. This paper used a temperature-dependent Young's modulus and Garofalo-Arrhenius creep equation to describe the solder deformation response. An energy-density-based empirical equation was used, along with the optimized mesh size in a finite-element model calculation with different solder joint geometries and packaging types such as power modules, and wafer-level chip-scale packages to determine how to accommodate the strain rate effect given various ramp rates.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2015.2462726","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298/7234980/07173434.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7234980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2015.2462726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Assessment of Packaging Solder Joints Under Different Thermal Cycle Loading Rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Assessment of Packaging Solder Joints Under Different Thermal Cycle Loading Rates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173434/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15415892","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7173434/","volume":"15","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC102-2221-E-007-038-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Assessment of Packaging Solder Joints Under Different Thermal Cycle Loading Rates","sourcePdf":"tdmr-chiang-2462726-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116332S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"7234980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7234980","articleId":"7173434","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7173435,"authors":[{"name":"Yichen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7349281/7173435/wang-2462816_print-small.gif","p":["\nYichen Wang (S'13\u2013M'14) received the B.S. degree in information engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and communications engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

To address the above issue, we investigate the optimal power allocation strategy for underlay-based CRN with PU's statistical delay QoS protection. Instead of utilizing the widely-used interference power constraint to protect PU's transmission, we aim at satisfying PU's statistical delay QoS requirement characterized by the queue-length bound violation probability. By applying the theory of effective capacity, we further convert PU's queue-length bound violation probability constraint to the equivalent maximum sustainable traffic load requirement. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to maximize SU's average throughput while meeting PU's statistical delay QoS requirement as well as SU's average and peak transmit power constraints, which can be proved as a nonconvex problem. By employing the theories of convex hull and probabilistic transmission, we convert the original nonconvex problem to the equivalent strictly convex problem and then obtain the optimal power allocation strategy, which adapts to both PU's delay QoS requirements and channel conditions. Moreover, we also develop for comparison a fixed power allocation scheme that only adjusts with PU's delay QoS requirements. Simulation results are provided which demonstrate that both the optimal and fixed schemes can flexibly allocate the upperbounded transmit power budget according to PU's delay QoS requirements, but the proposed optimal power allocation strategy can also efficiently exploit the time-varying nature of wireless channels and thus significantly outperforms the fixed power allocation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2462816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07173435.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2462816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"6896","endPage":"6910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Underlay-Based Cognitive Radio Networks With Primary User's Statistical Delay QoS Provisioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Underlay-Based Cognitive Radio Networks With Primary User's Statistical Delay QoS Provisioning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173435/","volume":"14","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7173435/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676956","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401348"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2014M550493"},{"fundingName":"National Hi-Tech Research and Development Program of China (863)","grantNumber":"2014AA01A707"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation for Underlay-Based Cognitive Radio Networks With Primary User's Statistical Delay QoS Provisioning","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2462816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145187S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7173435","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7173440,"authors":[{"name":"Qurrat-Ul-Ain Nadeem","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7349281/7173440/nadee-2462828-small.gif","p":["\n\nQurrat-Ul-Ain Nadeem was born in Lahore, Pakistan.

Recently, the trend is to enhance system performance by exploiting the channel's degrees of freedom in the elevation, which necessitates the characterization of 3D channels. We present an information-theoretic channel model for MIMO systems that supports the elevation dimension. The model is based on the principle of maximum entropy, which enables us to determine the distribution of the channel matrix consistent with the prior information on the angles. Based on this model, we provide analytical expression for the cumulative density function (CDF) of the mutual information (MI) for systems with a single receive and finite number of transmit antennas in the general signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) regime. The result is extended to systems with finite receive antennas in the low SINR regime. A Gaussian approximation to the asymptotic behavior of MI distribution is derived for the large number of transmit antennas and paths regime. We corroborate our analysis with simulations that study the performance gains realizable through meticulous selection of the transmit antenna downtilt angles, confirming the potential of elevation beamforming to enhance system performance. The results are directly applicable to the analysis of 5G 3D-Massive MIMO-systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Massive MIMO Systems: Modeling and Performance Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2462828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07173440.pdf","startPage":"6926","endPage":"6939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2462828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"3D Massive MIMO Systems: Modeling and Performance Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7173440/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676952","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CRG 3"},{"fundingName":"Office of Sponsored Research at KAUST"},{"fundingName":"ERC","grantNumber":"305123"},{"fundingName":"MORE (Advanced Mathematical Tools for Complex Network Engineering)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Massive MIMO Systems: Modeling and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"twc-nadeem-2462828-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1305S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7173440","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173442,"authors":[{"name":"Liqin Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7349281/7173442/ding-2462844-small.gif","p":["\n\nLiqin Ding received the B.S. and M.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

By decomposing SMP into a series of subspace avoiding problems (SAP) and developing a modified sphere-decoding (SD) algorithm based on the Schnorr-Euchner (SE) enumeration strategy to solve each instance of SAP, two practical algorithms are constructed to solve SMP exactly for real and complex lattices respectively. The initial radius and the starting position on the search-tree of the SAP algorithm are optimized by exploiting the intermediate results obtained in previous rounds. As compared to the Minkowski reduction algorithm, the proposed complex SMP algorithm brings not only more freedom in lattice code design, but also computation reduction in finding the coefficient matrix. Moreover, benefiting from the tree-search initialization optimization, the proposed real SMP algorithm can bring even more computation reduction when the system size is large. However, the proposed algorithms achieve practically the same performance as Minkowski reduction for the IF linear receiver, as the Minkowski-reduced basis approximates successive minima very closely.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2462844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07173442.pdf","startPage":"6955","endPage":"6966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2462844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact SMP Algorithms for Integer-Forcing Linear MIMO Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173442/","displayDocTitle":"Exact SMP Algorithms for Integer-Forcing Linear MIMO Receivers","volume":"14","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676931","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7173442/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371101"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Biological, Internet, New Energy and New Materials Industry Development Project","grantNumber":"JC201104210030A"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Basic Research Project of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20140417172417169"},{"fundingName":"ZTE Corporation commissioned development project"},{"fundingName":"WiNDOW"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"318992"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact SMP Algorithms for Integer-Forcing Linear MIMO Receivers","sourcePdf":"twc-ding-2462844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114772S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7173442","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7173443,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6884276/7229412/7173443/zhang-2463076-small.gif","p":["Lei Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering, the M.Sc. degree in electromagnetic fields and microwave technology, both from the Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xi\u2019an, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the Communications Research Group, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 2005, 2008, 2011, respectively.

Considering individual power transmission constraint at each relay node, the corresponding constrained adaptive algorithms are also derived as an extension. An analysis of the overhead and stepsize range for the derived algorithms are then provided and the excess mean square error (EMSE) for the RSB case is studied based on the energy reservation method. As demonstrated by our simulation results, a better performance has been achieved by our proposed algorithms and they have a very low computational complexity and can be implemented on low cost and low processing power devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15417269","htmlLink":"/document/7173443/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Distributed Beamforming for Relay Networks Based on Local Channel State Information","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"619563"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003513","fundingName":"University of Surrey"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Distributed Beamforming for Relay Networks Based on Local Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"tsipn-liu-2463076-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087493S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6884276","isNumber":"7229412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6884276","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7229412","articleId":"7173443","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7173444,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyu Liu","affiliation":["Power Electronic and Motion Control Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7173444/liu-small.gif","p":["Mingyu Liu was born in Wuhan, China, in 1989.

Serial linear-assisted switching converter, one of the solutions of EA, has benefits in high tracking bandwidth, high tracking accuracy, and relatively low switching losses. Among those many types of linear-assisted switching converter, the design of a linear regulator is rarely mentioned. This paper proposes a new design of linear regulator to supply a higher voltage and maintain high tracking bandwidth by dividing a linear regulator into four different parts. Beyond that, an input filter is recommended to increase the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of a linear regulator in high frequency, which is able to reduce the glitch caused by multilevel voltage power supply. An EA prototype is composed of the proposed linear regulator, the PSRR improvement filter, and the multilevel voltage power supply. To align signals, circular convolution is suggested as a modified algorithm. Experiments show that this prototype has a maximum output of 40 V, a tracking bandwidth of about 2 MHz for a full-range sinusoidal signal, and a tracking ability for OFDM envelope signal with a subcarrier up to 5 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2463122","startPage":"3673","endPage":"3689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2463122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352399","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7352399/07173444.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Regulator Design Considerations of the Serial Linear-Assisted Switching Converter Used as Envelope Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173444/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Linear Regulator Design Considerations of the Serial Linear-Assisted Switching Converter Used as Envelope Amplifier","volume":"31","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7173444/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15677496","publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan Project","grantNumber":"JCYJ20140417172417127 and JSGG20150529114007828"},{"fundingName":"ITS fund from China Academy of Space Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Regulator Design Considerations of the Serial Linear-Assisted Switching Converter Used as Envelope Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2463122-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118744S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7173444","onlineDate":"30 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7173484,"authors":[{"name":"Umer Farooq","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering COMSATS IIT, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Umer","lastName":"Farooq","id":"37397451100"},{"name":"M.

However, scientists who need to leverage such platforms are usually not parallel or distributed programming experts. Thus, they face numerous challenges when implementing and porting their software-based experimental tools to such platforms. In this paper, we introduce a sequential-to-parallel engineering approach to help scientists in engineering their scientific applications. Our approach is based on capturing sequential program details, planned parallelization aspects, and program deployment details using a set of domain-specific visual languages (DSVLs). Then, using code generation, we generate the corresponding parallel program using necessary parallel and distributed programming models (MPI, Open CL, or Open MP). We summarize three case studies (matrix multiplication, N-Body simulation, and digital signal processing) to evaluate our approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Instruction sets","Graphics processing units","Kernel","Data structures","Parallel programming","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel programming","program compilers","visual languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["re-engineering sequential programs","model-driven engineering","software-based experimental tools","sequential-to-parallel engineering approach","domain-specific visual languages","DSVL","code generation","parallel program","distributed programming models","Open MP","MPI","Open CL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parallel Programming","High-Performance Computing","Domain-specific Visual Languages","Model-driven Engineering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SE4HPCS.2015.8","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Software Engineering for High Performance Computing in Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Software Engineering for High Performance Computing in Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173493/7173496/07173504.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SE4HPCS.2015.8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supporting Scientists in Re-engineering Sequential Programs to Parallel Using Model-Driven Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Supporting Scientists in Re-engineering Sequential Programs to Parallel Using Model-Driven Engineering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7173504/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7173504/","accessionNumber":"15345729","conferenceDate":"18-18 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-18 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting Scientists in Re-engineering Sequential Programs to Parallel Using Model-Driven Engineering","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"7082a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050266S","chronDate":"18-18 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173493","isNumber":"7173496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7173496","articleId":"7173504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7173513,"authors":[{"name":"Madhu Hari","affiliation":["Energy & Geoscience Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Madhu","lastName":"Hari","id":"37085471213"},{"name":"Shirley Moore","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Texas at El Paso El Paso, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Shirley","lastName":"Moore","id":"37276661600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7082-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7173513","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Graphics processing units","Software engineering","Ports (Computers)","Kernel","Multicore processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FORTRAN","graphics processing units","project management","software maintenance","software portability","software tools","source code (software)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scientific code","master level software engineering project","software engineering methodologies","portability","maintainability","fusion energy code","GPU","Open ACC","tool support","Fortran","supercomputing environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel computing","portability","performance","productivity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7173513","abstract":"This work was carried out as a master's level software engineering project over the course of two semesters.

This letter proposes a channel-aware distributed MAC protocol for multichannel cognitive radio networks. The transmitting nodes use channel state information to exploit the available multiuser and multichannel diversity, by contending only under relatively favorable channel conditions. Towards this end, each node utilizes a threshold that is dynamically updated according to certain rules.

The proposed control scheme has been realized at both kinematics and dynamics levels. The kinematics predictive steering controller generates command of desired velocities that are achieved by employing a low-level motion controller, while the dynamics predictive controller directly generates torques used to steer the WMR to the target. In the presence of both kinematics and dynamics constraints, the control design is carried out using quadratic programming (QP) for optimal performance. The neurodynamic optimization technique, particularly the primal-dual neural network, is employed to solve the QP problems. Theoretical analysis has been first performed to show that the desired velocities can be achieved with the guaranteed stability, as well as with the global convergence to the optimal solutions of formulated convex programming problems. Experiments have then been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and illustrate its advantage over the conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2015.2454484","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/7410136/07174529.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"564","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2015.2454484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-Based Model Predictive Control for Steering of a Nonholonomic Mobile Robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Vision-Based Model Predictive Control for Steering of a Nonholonomic Mobile Robot","volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15787090","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7174529/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of china","grantNumber":"61174045, 61473120, U1201244 and 61473183"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0195"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation through the Ministry of Education, China","grantNumber":"20130172110026"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2014A030313266"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Cooperative Innovation Projects","grantNumber":"2014Y2-00507"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2015AA042303"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-Based Model Predictive Control for Steering of a Nonholonomic Mobile Robot","sourcePdf":"tcst-yang-2454484-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108007S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"7410136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7410136","articleId":"7174529","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7174539,"authors":[{"name":"Guang Yang","affiliation":["Communication Theory Department, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7174539/yang-2463284_print-small.gif","p":["\nGuang Yang received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2010.

However, the high directivity and penetration loss make it vulnerable to blockage events, which can be frequent in indoor environments. Given network topology information in sufficient precision, we investigate the average throughput and outage probability when the connection between any two nodes can be established either via the line-of-sight (LOS) link, through a reflection link, or by a half-duplex relay node. We model the reflection link as an LOS with extra power loss and derive the closed-form expression for the relative reflection loss. For networks with a central coordinator and multiple relays, we also propose a generic algorithm, maximum throughput path selection (MTPS), to select the optimal path that maximizes the throughput. The complexity of the MTPS algorithm is O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) for networks equipped with n relays, whereas a brute-forced algorithm has complexity of O(n \u00b7 n!). Numerical results show that increasing the number of relays can significantly increase the average throughput and decrease the outage probability, and resorting to reflection paths provides significant gains when the probability of link blockage is high.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174539/","volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7174539/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15524649","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Throughput Path Selection With Random Blockage for Indoor 60 GHz Relay Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371105"},{"fundingName":"National 973 Programs","grantNumber":"2013CB329001"},{"fundingName":"EU Marie Curie Project, QUICK","grantNumber":"612652"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council (VR)","grantNumber":"637-2013-473"},{"fundingName":"MIT Wireless Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Throughput Path Selection With Random Blockage for Indoor 60 GHz Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-xiao-2463284-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098467S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7174539","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7174541,"authors":[{"name":"Tran Huu Thang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tsuruoka College, Yamagata, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/7353235/7174541/thang-small.gif","p":["Tran Huu Thang (M\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from\n the Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Doshisha\n University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2014.","From February 2005 to February 2008, he was with the Institute of Energy, Vietnam.

We develop an iterative nonlinear least squares estimator, which involves a large number of computations as it requires high resolution search in the initial frequency and frequency rate parameter space. As an alternative, we suggest two suboptimal low-complexity estimators. The first is based on the high-order ambiguity function, which reduces the problem to a one-dimensional search. The second method applies our recently published harmonic separate-estimate method, which was used for constant-amplitude harmonic chirps. We present modifications of both methods for harmonic chirps with random amplitudes. We also provide a framework for estimating the number of harmonic components. Numerical simulations show that the iterative nonlinear least-squares estimator achieves its asymptotic accuracy in medium to high signal-to-noise ratio, while the two sub-optimal low-complexity estimators perform well in high signal-to-noise ratio. Real data examples demonstrate the performance of the harmonic separate-estimate method on random amplitude real-life signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7174546/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15568126","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Initial Frequency and Frequency Rate Estimation of Random-Amplitude Harmonic Chirps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Initial Frequency and Frequency Rate Estimation of Random-Amplitude Harmonic Chirps","sourcePdf":"tsp-doweck-2463251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095101S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7307924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7307924","articleId":"7174546","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7174548,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Mahdi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Mahdi","id":"37604278800"},{"name":"Vassilis Paliouras","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Vassilis","lastName":"Paliouras","id":"37271413400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"7174548","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Complexity theory","Parity check codes","Bit error rate","Phase change materials","Hardware","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding complexity","quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","parity check matrix construction technique","PCM construction technique","small inverted binary base matrix","QC-LDPC codes","BER performance","low-density parity-check codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BER performance","density reduction","encoding complexity","hardware architecture","LDPC encoding","matrix inversion","quasi-cyclic LDPC"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a parity check matrix (PCM) construction technique that reduces the encoding complexity of quasi-cyclic (QC)-LDPC codes. The proposed construction method is based on a constraint selection of shifting factors, shown here to reduce the density of an inverted matrix used in several encoding algorithms. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the complexity of encoding schemes involving inverted matrices, can be defined by the density of the small inverted binary base matrix and not by the extended QC-PCM. Comparisons of the proposed codes with codes employed in international standards and with randomly shifted QC-LDPC codes of comparable characteristics, show the low complexity of the corresponding hardware implementations and a BER performance equivalent to that of previously reported codes without increasing the decoding complexity. Furthermore, adoption of the proposed method can decrease the complexity of several encoding procedures; in particular, an area reduction of 40%-55% is reported for QC-LDPC encoders, while a reduction of 86% is reported for Multi-Level-QC-LDPC encoders.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2463258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7293100/07174548.pdf","startPage":"6096","endPage":"6108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7293100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2463258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Encoding Complexity of Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Encoding Complexity of Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174548/","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15519704","volume":"63","issue":"22","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Encoding Complexity of Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tsp-mahdi-2463258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047097S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2015","isNumber":"7293100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","articleId":"7174548","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7174552,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7293100/7174552/7174552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Fang received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2011 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in 2013.","He is currently working towards his Ph.D. degree at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA.

In the proposed Viterbi decoder, refresh operations are completely removed in the eDRAM, by ensuring that the read-after-write period of survivor memory is shorter than the retention time of the gain cell. In order to facilitate the write operation with single-supply voltage, a beneficial read word-line (RWL) coupling technique is proposed. In this work, we also present a reference voltage generation scheme to support single-ended read operation. Thanks to the decoupled read and write structure of the gain cell, the proposed eDRAM can support dual-port operations without large area overhead, thus doubling the bandwidth of memories in the Viterbi decoder. To further reduce the area of the customized Viterbi memory, common redundant hardware between the memory peripheral and computational logics is identified and eliminated without latency overhead. The 4 bit soft-decision 64-state Viterbi decoder with 24 kb eDRAM (1-bank) is implemented in 65 nm CMOS process technology. The chip measurement results show 44% area and 39% power savings over the conventional SRAM-based Viterbi decoder implementation.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2454241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2454241","startPage":"2451","endPage":"2462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7279217/07174555.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Refresh-Less eDRAM Macro With Embedded Voltage Reference and Selective Read for an Area and Power Efficient Viterbi Decoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Refresh-Less eDRAM Macro With Embedded Voltage Reference and Selective Read for an Area and Power Efficient Viterbi Decoder","volume":"50","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15489255","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7174555/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Refresh-Less eDRAM Macro With Embedded Voltage Reference and Selective Read for an Area and Power Efficient Viterbi Decoder","sourcePdf":"jssc-park-2454241-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157304S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7279217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7279217","articleId":"7174555","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7174556,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Anh Nghiem","affiliation":["Chair of High Frequency Electronics, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7234979/7174556/7174556-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuan Anh Nghiem (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Hanoi University of Transport and Communications (UTC), Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1997, the M.Sc. degree in microwave engineering from TU M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany, in 2004, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.","Since 2004, he has been with UTC, as a Lecturer.

By introducing a Doherty-type output combiner into the conventional sequential power amplifier (PA), highly efficient amplification over broadband and wide dynamic range for the reconfigurable output power back-off can be achieved. The proposed amplifier mimics both the sequential and the Doherty PAs by exploiting the active load modulation region that has not been considered in the design of Doherty amplifiers. A broadband SPA-D prototype having 8-dB output back-off power (OBO) is designed and implemented. The experimental results exhibit drain efficiencies of 50%-75% at 7-10-dB OBO and 57%-70% at peak power with Doherty-like behavior over 700-MHz bandwidth centered at 2.35 GHz. The ability to easily reconfigure the breakpoint is experimentally verified, providing a convenient means for optimizing the amplifier efficiency according to various wireless standards. In addition, by using a memoryless digital predistortion, the spectrum emission mask required for long-term evolution down link can be fulfilled, making it well suited for applications in modern wireless transmitters.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2456901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7234979/07174556.pdf","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2456901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7234979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband Sequential Power Amplifier With Doherty-Type Active Load Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174556/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Sequential Power Amplifier With Doherty-Type Active Load Modulation","volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15414394","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7174556/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Sequential Power Amplifier With Doherty-Type Active Load Modulation","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nghiem-2456901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105844S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7234979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7234979","articleId":"7174556","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7174557,"authors":[{"name":"Joongheon Kim","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7544544/7174557/7174557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joongheon Kim (M\u201906) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science and engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2014.","Before joining USC, he was a Research Engineer with LG Electronics, Seoul, Korea, from 2006 to 2009.

Recent information-theoretic results have shown that a combination of caching on the users' devices and device-to-device (D2D) communications yields throughput scalability for very dense networks, which represent critical bottlenecks for conventional cellular and wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies. In this paper, we consider the implementation of such caching D2D systems where each device pre-caches a subset of video files from a library, and users requesting a file that is not already in their library obtain it from neighboring devices through D2D communication. We develop centralized and distributed algorithms for the delivery phase, encompassing a link scheduling and a streaming component. The centralized scheduling is based on the max-weighted independent set (MWIS) principle and uses message-passing to determine max-weight independent sets. The distributed scheduling is based on a variant of the FlashLinQ link scheduling algorithm, enhanced by introducing video-streaming specific weights. In both cases, the streaming component is based on a quality-aware stochastic optimization approach, reminiscent of current Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) technology, for which users sequentially request video \u201cchunks\u201d by choosing adaptively their quality level. The streaming and the scheduling components are coupled by the length of the users' request queues. Through extensive system simulation, the proposed approaches are shown to provide sizeable gains with respect to baseline schemes formed by the concatenation of off-the-shelf FlashLinQ with proportional fair link scheduling and DASH at the application layer.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2015.2452272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7544544","startPage":"2319","endPage":"2331","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7544544/07174557.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2015.2452272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality-Aware Streaming and Scheduling for Device-to-Device Video Delivery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Transmitters","Scheduling","Interference","Peer-to-peer computing","Wireless communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message passing","optimisation","telecommunication scheduling","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality-aware streaming","quality-aware scheduling","device-to-device video delivery","on-demand video streaming","wireless networks","video files","streaming component","centralized scheduling","max-weighted independent set principle","message-passing","distributed scheduling","quality-aware stochastic optimization","proportional fair link scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive streaming","device-to-device","quality awareness","scheduling","video delivery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Quality-Aware Streaming and Scheduling for Device-to-Device Video Delivery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174557/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7174557/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16231785","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality-Aware Streaming and Scheduling for Device-to-Device Video Delivery","sourcePdf":"tnet-kim-2452272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155725S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7544544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7544544","articleId":"7174557","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7174558,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7307924/7174558/7174558-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Gao (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2011.","He is currently working towards Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

Specifically, a nonorthogonal downlink pilot design is first proposed, which is very different from standard orthogonal pilots. By exploiting the spatially common sparsity of massive MIMO channels, a compressive sensing (CS) based adaptive CSI acquisition scheme is proposed, where the consumed time slot overhead only adaptively depends on the sparsity level of the channels. In addition, a distributed sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the channels of multiple subcarriers. Furthermore, by exploiting the temporal channel correlation, a closed-loop channel tracking scheme is provided, which adaptively designs the nonorthogonal pilot according to the previous channel estimation to achieve an enhanced CSI acquisition. Finally, we generalize the results of the multiple-measurement-vectors case in CS and derive the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound of the proposed scheme, which enlightens us to design the nonorthogonal pilot signals for the improved performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts, and it is capable of approaching the performance bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174558/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2015","volume":"63","issue":"23","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15568120","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7174558/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Common Sparsity Based Adaptive Channel Estimation and Feedback for FDD Massive MIMO","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Common Sparsity Based Adaptive Channel Estimation and Feedback for FDD Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"tsp-chen-2463260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108346S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7307924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"258","xplore-issue":"7307924","articleId":"7174558","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7174559,"authors":[{"name":"Daquan Feng","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center (SRMC), Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7349281/7174559/dfeng-2463280-small.gif","p":["\n\nDaquan Feng received the B.S.E degree from Henan University, Kaifeng, China, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree from the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, UESTC, Chengdu, China in 2015.

We aim to maximize the overall energy-efficiency (EE) of D2D users and regular cellular users (RCUs) while considering the circuit power consumption and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both types of users as well as power constraints. Three transmission modes, namely, dedicated mode, reusing mode, and cellular mode, are considered for D2D users to share spectrum with RCUs. Parametric Dinkelbach method and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) are adopted to transform the original optimization problems into more tractable forms through sequential convex approximations. Then, interior point method is exploited to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results show that system EE can be improved significantly with the proposed mode switching algorithm compared with the single mode transmission. Besides, it is also shown that the reusing mode is more preferred in the EE based mode switching while it is the dedicated mode in the spectrum-efficiency (SE) based mode switching in most situations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2463280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07174559.pdf","startPage":"6993","endPage":"7003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2463280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode Switching for Energy-Efficient Device-to-Device Communications in Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Mode Switching for Energy-Efficient Device-to-Device Communications in Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174559/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15676945","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7174559/","volume":"14","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"1247545 and 1405116"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61471089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode Switching for Energy-Efficient Device-to-Device Communications in Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-feng-2463280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136281S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7174559","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7174561,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Tamiazzo","affiliation":["Commscope Italy, Agrate Brianza, Mi, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287853/7174561/7174561-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Tamiazzo received the Laurea degree in telecommunication engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2002, and the Master degree in information technology from Cefriel, Milan, Italy, in 2003.","He is currently with Commscope, Agrate Brianza, Italy, where he is involved in the design of microwave filters and combiners for wireless applications."]},"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Tamiazzo","id":"37428699300"},{"name":"Giuseppe Macchiarella","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287853/7174561/7174561-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Giuseppe Macchiarella (M\u201995\u2013SM\u201906\u2013F\u201915) is currently an Associate Professor of microwave engineering with the Department of Electronic and Information, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy.

Inspired by the matrix pencil form, we construct a D-fold Hankel matrix from the measurements and exploit its Vandermonde decomposition in the noiseless case. MUSIC amounts to identifying a noise subspace, evaluating a noise-space correlation function, and localizing frequencies by searching the s smallest local minima of the noise-space correlation function.

When noise exists, we provide an explicit estimate on the perturbation of the noise-space correlation function in terms of noise level, dimension D, the minimum separation among frequencies, the maximum and minimum amplitudes while frequencies are separated by 2 Rayleigh Length (RL) at each direction. As a by-product the maximum and minimum non-zero singular values of the multidimensional Vandermonde matrix whose nodes are on the unit sphere are estimated under a gap condition of the nodes. Under the 2-RL separation condition, if noise is i.i.d. Gaussian, we show that perturbation of the noise-space correlation function decays like \u221a(log(#(N))/#(N)) as the sample size #(N) increases. When the separation among frequencies drops below 2 RL, our numerical experiments show that the noise tolerance of MUSIC obeys a power law with the minimum separation of frequencies.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7307924/7174562-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7174562/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15568132","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MUSIC for Multidimensional Spectral Estimation: Stability and Super-Resolution","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"ONR-N000141210601"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"MUSIC for Multidimensional Spectral Estimation: Stability and Super-Resolution","sourcePdf":"tsp-liao-2463255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091567S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7307924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7307924","articleId":"7174562","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7174563,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyu Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7349281/7174563/wang-2463281-small.gif","p":["\n\nTianyu Wang (S'11) received the B.S. degrees in physics and a double major in computer software from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2011.

Offloading such traffic through complementary networks, such as a delay tolerant network formed by device-to-device (D2D) communications between mobile subscribers, is a promising solution to reduce the cellular burdens. In the existing solutions, mobile users are assumed to be volunteers who selflessly deliver the content to every other user in proximity while moving. However, practical users are selfish and they will evaluate their individual payoffs in the D2D sharing process, which may highly influence the network performance compared to the case of selfless users. In this paper, we take user selfishness into consideration and propose a network formation game to capture the dynamic characteristics of selfish behaviors. In the proposed game, we provide the utility function of each user and specify the conditions under which the subscribers are guaranteed to converge to a stable network. Then, we propose a practical network formation algorithm in which the users can decide their D2D sharing strategies based on their historical records. Simulation results show that user selfishness can highly degrade the efficiency of data offloading, compared with ideal volunteer users. Also, the decrease caused by user selfishness can be highly affected by the cost ratio between the cellular transmission and D2D transmission, the access delays, and mobility patterns.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2463281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07174563.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2463281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","startPage":"7004","endPage":"7015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social Data Offloading in D2D-Enhanced Cellular Networks by Network Formation Games","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Social Data Offloading in D2D-Enhanced Cellular Networks by Network Formation Games","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676933","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7174563/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 863","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222104 and U1301255"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Fund of HUAWEI"},{"fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1456921, CNS-1443917, ECCS-1405121 and NSFC 61428101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social Data Offloading in D2D-Enhanced Cellular Networks by Network Formation Games","sourcePdf":"twc-song-2463281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087216S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7174563","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7174564,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Sengupta","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7234979/7174564/7174564-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaushik Sengupta (M\u201912) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electronics and electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India, both in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.","In February 2013, he joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.

Fast fading variation in high mobility systems introduces Doppler diversity that can benefit system performance. On the other hand, it is more difficult to estimate and track a fast changing channel, thus channel estimation errors are non-negligible and they may seriously degrade system performance. Such a tradeoff relationship is studied by identifying the exact analytical expressions of two performance metrics: the maximum Doppler diversity order achievable with imperfect channel state information (CSI), and the loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) caused by channel estimation errors. The analytical study is enabled by a simple repetition code at the transmitter, and a new optimum diversity receiver developed by analyzing the statistical properties of channel estimation errors. With the analytical results, the optimum allocation of transmission energy between pilot symbols and data symbols are obtained to simultaneously maximize the Doppler diversity order and minimize the SNR loss, thus achieve the optimum tradeoff between the two. The results reveal the fundamental performance limits of Doppler diversity systems operating in the presence of imperfect CSI, and they can be used to guide the design of practical systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2463276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07174567.pdf","startPage":"6981","endPage":"6992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2463276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Mobility Wireless Communications With Doppler Diversity: Fundamental Performance Limits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174567/","displayDocTitle":"High Mobility Wireless Communications With Doppler Diversity: Fundamental Performance Limits","volume":"14","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676953","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7174567/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major State Basic Research Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61032002"},{"fundingName":"Innovative Intelligence Base Project","grantNumber":"111-2-14"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"SWJTU12ZT02/2682014ZT11"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1202075 and ECCS-1405403"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Mobility Wireless Communications With Doppler Diversity: Fundamental Performance Limits","sourcePdf":"twc-zhou-2463276-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086527S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7174567","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7174568,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Won Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7293100/7174568/7174568-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Won Choi (M\u201910) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering, Seoul National University and earned Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, respectively.

The proposed sKTS algorithm builds on expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and consists of two main operations: 1) Kalman smoothing to obtain the a posteriori statistics of the source signal vectors and 2) greedy tree search to estimate the support of the signal vectors. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed sKTS algorithm is effective in recovering the sparse signals and performs close to the Oracle (genie-based) Kalman estimator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Recovery of Simultaneously Sparse Time-Varying Signals From Multiple Measurement Vectors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2463259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7293100/07174568.pdf","startPage":"6136","endPage":"6148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2463259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7293100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174568/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2015","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Recovery of Simultaneously Sparse Time-Varying Signals From Multiple Measurement Vectors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/7174568/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15519705","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"MSIP-2014R1A5A1011478"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Recovery of Simultaneously Sparse Time-Varying Signals From Multiple Measurement Vectors","sourcePdf":"tsp-shim-2463259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114062S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7293100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7293100","articleId":"7174568","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7174569,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7174569/yzhan-2463272-small.gif","p":["\n\nYong-Ping Zhang (M'11) received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunication \nengineering and the M.Eng. degree (with highest honors) in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from Xidian \nUniversity, Xi'an, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","In 2004, he was as a Program Engineer with China Telecom, Shenzhen, China.

We first show that rain does not always have a negative impact on system performance, provided that accurate instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter and receiver. In addition, we propose a practical and low-cost transmission scheme, referred to as hardware-constrained statistical precoding (HC-SP), for mmW MIMO systems in rainfall environments. This scheme only requires statistical channel information at the transmitter and takes into consideration the hardware constraints on transceiver imposed by the high radio-frequency chain cost. Simulation results demonstrate that the HC-SP scheme allows the mmW MIMO system to have near-optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2463272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07174569.pdf","startPage":"5317","endPage":"5326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2463272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Adaptive Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems in Rain Scattering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174569/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Adaptive Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems in Rain Scattering","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141231","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7174569/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Adaptive Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems in Rain Scattering","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2463272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073404S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7174569","onlineDate":"31 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7174598,"authors":[{"name":"Jianming Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37536452800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7174598","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Finite difference methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earth electrodes","electric field integral equations","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD modeling","flat electrode","grounding system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field singularity","finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD)","flat electrode"]}],"abstract":"Presents comments on the paper, \"An Algorithm for the FDTD Modeling of Flat Electrodes in Grounding Systems\u201d R.

A Highly Innovative Bistatic SAR Mission for Global Observation of Dynamic Processes on the Earth's Surface","abstract":"Tandem-L is a proposal for a highly innovative L-band SAR satellite mission for the global observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface with hitherto unparalleled quality and resolution. It is based on the results of a pre-phase A study which started in 2013 and is currently undergoing a phase-A study. Thanks to the novel imaging techniques and the vast recording capacity with up to 8 terabytes/day, it will provide vital information for solving pressing scientific questions in the biosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere. By this, the new L-band SAR mission will make an essential contribution for a better understanding of the Earth system and its dynamics. Tandem-L will, moreover, open new opportunities for risk analysis, disaster management and environmental monitoring by employing especially designed acquisition modes and techniques in combination with a reconfigurable tandem satellite configuration and an L-band SAR instrument with advanced digital beamforming techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174656/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 July 2015","volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7174656/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Tandem-L: A Highly Innovative Bistatic SAR Mission for Global Observation of Dynamic Processes on the Earth's Surface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tandem-L: A Highly Innovative Bistatic SAR Mission for Global Observation of Dynamic Processes on the Earth's Surface","sourcePdf":"03mgrs02-moreira-2437353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151927S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6245518","isNumber":"7174632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245518","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"7174632","articleId":"7174656","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7174669,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Berntsson Svensson","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Eng., Chalmers I University of Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Richard Berntsson","lastName":"Svensson","id":"37406265400"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Regnell","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Regnell","id":"37283883600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7073-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7174669","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Companies","Software","Requirements engineering","Testing","Interviews","Prototypes","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","formal verification","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QUPER roadmap view","high-level decision-making process","software testing","QR verification","decision-making process","aligning requirements engineering","QR management","quality performance model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QUPER","Alignment","Quality Requirements","Software Testing"]}],"abstract":"Weak alignment of requirements engineering (RE) and Software Testing (ST) may lead to problems in delivering the required products in time with the right quality. Despite the importance of aligning RE and ST, the research have mainly been focused on one or the other of RE and ST. Previous work has identified several challenges in aligning RE and ST related to Quality Requirements, for example, the need for tool support for QR, defining and managing QR, and verification of QR. In this position paper, we introduce a new view of the QUPER model, namely aligning QR targets and test results in QUPERs roadmap view. The alignment view was evaluated at a case company with 13 practitioners. The results show that the alignment of QR and test results using QUPER's roadmap view was viewed as an important input to the decision-making process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aligning Quality Requirements and Test Results with QUPER's Roadmap View for Improved High-Level Decision-Making","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 2nd International Workshop on Requirements Engineering and Testing","doi":"10.1109/RET.2015.8","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 2nd International Workshop on Requirements Engineering and Testing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173533/7174661/07174669.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RET.2015.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7174661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-18 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Aligning Quality Requirements and Test Results with QUPER's Roadmap View for Improved High-Level Decision-Making","conferenceDate":"18-18 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7174669/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15378531","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aligning Quality Requirements and Test Results with QUPER's Roadmap View for Improved High-Level Decision-Making","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"7073a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092758S","chronDate":"18-18 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173533","isNumber":"7174661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173533","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7174661","articleId":"7174669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7174704,"authors":[{"name":"Zbigniew Sadowski","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, University of Zielona G\u00f3ra Poland"],"firstName":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Sadowski","id":"37085489254"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8416-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8415-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-1428"}],"articleNumber":"7174704","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":607},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Payloads","Access protocols","Robustness","Multiaccess communication","Security","Power industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","power cables","protocols","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLC-PRIME","PLC-G3 protocol","smart grid communication technology","power line communication","power cable","advanced metering infrastructure","AMI","distribution automation","street light control","public charging","NB-PLC system","data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power-line communication","PLC protocols","Communication in Smart Grids"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174704","abstract":"The most adopted communication technology in Smart Grids is PLC (Power Line Communications).

At the same time, this field is inherently practical, and thus of industrial relevance: indeed, protecting a piece of software against tampering, malicious modifications or reverse-engineering is a very difficult task. In this paper, we present and discuss a software obfuscation prototype tool based on the LLVM compilation suite. Our tool is built as different passes, where some of them have been open-sourced and are freely available, that work on the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) code. This approach brings several advantages, including the fact that it is language-agnostic and mostly independent of the target architecture. Our current prototype supports basic instruction substitutions, insertion of bogus control-flow constructs mixed with opaque predicates, control-flow flattening, procedures merging as well as a code tamper-proofing algorithm embedding code and data checksums directly in the control-flow flattening mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/SPRO.2015.10","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Software Protection","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Software Protection","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173494/7174794/07174804.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPRO.2015.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7174794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obfuscator-LLVM -- Software Protection for the Masses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-19 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174804/","displayDocTitle":"Obfuscator-LLVM -- Software Protection for the Masses","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15345744","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7174804/","conferenceDate":"19-19 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obfuscator-LLVM -- Software Protection for the Masses","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"7094a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075187S","chronDate":"19-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173494","isNumber":"7174794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173494","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"7174794","articleId":"7174804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7174849,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Nicolaescu","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Nicolaescu","id":"37085592980"},{"name":"Horst Lichter","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Horst","lastName":"Lichter","id":"37314241600"},{"name":"Yi Xu","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085590386"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7076-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7174849","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174849","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Couplings","Context","Databases","Complexity theory","Software","Object oriented modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented methods","software engineering","software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object oriented coupling metrics evolution","object oriented software development"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coupling metrics","evolution of metrics","object opriented coupling"]}],"abstract":"Coupling is one of the most important properties that affect the quality of the design and implementation of a software system. In the context of object oriented software development, coupling metrics and their impact on quality attributes have been investigated for a quarter of a century. In this work we review and critically analyze the developments in this domain by considering 26 of the most influential research papers addressing object oriented coupling. Our analysis reveals that a very strong theoretical background has been already developed but unfortunately without a clear impact on the industry practices and software analysis tooling. Even more, recent developments fail to address this problem and seem to even contribute to increasing this gap.

In our proposed JSPA scheme, SUs adopt the decode-and-forward relaying protocol to help PUs in a two-stage way. Meanwhile, a fraction of unallocated licensed spectrum is allocated for the secondary transmission in every stage. However, if the two-stage cooperation still cannot satisfy the PUs' outage quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, SUs then switch to the access mode and entirely capture the licensed spectrum. Our proposed scheme is to maximize the average transmission rate of SUs through joint optimal subcarriers and power allocation under the constraint of PUs' outage QoS requirement. The closed-form expressions about the outage probability and average transmission of both PUs and SUs are derived, and we prove the optimality of our scheme. Simulation results show that, compared with the conventional cognitive cooperation scheme, the average transmission rate of SUs is improved.","topic":"Recent Advances in Software Defined Networking for 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","volume":"3","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15352001","publicationDate":"2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7174936/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reciprocally Benefited Spectrum Access Scheme With Joint Power and Subcarrier Allocation in a Software-Defined Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"No. 61461136001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reciprocally Benefited Spectrum Access Scheme With Joint Power and Subcarrier Allocation in a Software-Defined Network","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2464081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120789S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Recent Advances in Software Defined Networking for 5G Networks"],"articleId":"7174936","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7174937,"authors":[{"name":"Armita Afsharinejad","affiliation":["Telecommunication Software and Systems Group, Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7387818/7174937/afsha-2463685-small.gif","p":["Armita Afsharinejad (S\u201915) received the Bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering and Master\u2019s degree in information technology (IT) engineering from the Azad University of Qazvin, Qazvin, Iran, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer science at the Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), Waterford, Ireland.","Her research interests include nanoscale networks, bioinspired optimization, and THz communications."]},"firstName":"Armita","lastName":"Afsharinejad","orcid":"0000-0002-7856-0521","id":"37644406300"},{"name":"Alan Davy","affiliation":["Telecommunication Software and Systems Group, Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7387818/7174937/adavy-2463685-small.gif","p":["Alan Davy received the B.Sc. degree in applied computing and Ph.D. degree from the Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Research Fellow with the TSSG Research Center, Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland.

Among the diverse range of applications that such networks promise, high-resolution plant monitoring systems are the categories which can benefit from the size and high sensitivity of nanosensor devices and also the high bandwidth provided by them. However, communications at the THz frequency band, especially within a hybrid channel like plant foliage, undergo peculiar types of attenuation and distortion. These phenomena, which can challenge the feasibility of the aforementioned applications, need to be addressed/modeled precisely. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first THz path-loss model within a plant environment. In addition, we provide a simplified model of plant structure as well as a model for the probability of successful transmissions between nanosensors and microscale receivers mounted on the plant stem. The introduced models consider the limited capability of THz radiation to propagate through plant leaves, and also the high free-space path-loss as the main sources of signal loss in the network communications. Furthermore, these models can be customized based on the structural characteristics of a plant, e.g., leaves size and distribution, to account for a variety of plant species. Finally, the performance of communications based on the provided models is evaluated for different network scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15721809","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7174937/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Plant Monitoring Nanosensor Networks at THz Frequencies","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001592","fundingName":"Higher Education Authority"},{"fundingName":"Research in Third Level Institutions"},{"fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)"},{"fundingName":"Telecommunications Graduate Initiative"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland via the CONNECT Research Centre","grantNumber":"13/RC/2077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Plant Monitoring Nanosensor Networks at THz Frequencies","sourcePdf":"jiot-afsharinejad-2463685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077457S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7387818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7387818","articleId":"7174937","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":7174939,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Due to the absence of Global Positioning System (GPS) signal, many other signals have been proposed for indoor usage. Among them, Wi-Fi (802.11) emerges as a promising one due to the pervasive deployment of wireless LANs (WLANs). In particular, Wi-Fi fingerprinting has been attracting much attention recently because it does not require line-of-sight measurement of access points (APs) and achieves high applicability in complex indoor environment. This survey overviews recent advances on two major areas of Wi-Fi fingerprint localization: advanced localization techniques and efficient system deployment. Regarding advanced techniques to localize users, we present how to make use of temporal or spatial signal patterns, user collaboration, and motion sensors. Regarding efficient system deployment, we discuss recent advances on reducing offline labor-intensive survey, adapting to fingerprint changes, calibrating heterogeneous devices for signal collection, and achieving energy efficiency for smartphones. We study and compare the approaches through our deployment experiences, and discuss some future directions.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2464084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2464084","startPage":"466","endPage":"490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/07174948.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wi-Fi Fingerprint-Based Indoor Positioning: Recent Advances and Comparisons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Wi-Fi Fingerprint-Based Indoor Positioning: Recent Advances and Comparisons","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15752728","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7174948/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"The Hong Kong R&D Center for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Enabling Technologies","grantNumber":"ITP/034/12LP"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grant Council (RGC) General Research Fund","grantNumber":"610713"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wi-Fi Fingerprint-Based Indoor Positioning: Recent Advances and Comparisons","sourcePdf":"comst-he-2464084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.434756S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"662","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"7174948","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7174950,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuro Kikuchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Kazuro Kikuchi (M'90\u2013SM'12\u2013F'13) was born\n in Miyagi, Japan, in 1952.

One of the things that has a lot of potential is the lighting equipment since it is widely used in our daily life. Recently, the technology of visible light communication (VLC) has been widely discussed. VLC has several advantages, such as freedom of license, line-of-sight security, and less health concern compared with radio-based systems. In addition, the rapid progress of light emitting diode (LED) technology by solid-state lighting allows VLC to be easily deployed and integrated with the existing lighting infrastructure at low costs. However, VLC, when integrated with lighting infrastructure, is usually for one-way communication and is highly sensitive to external interfering light. Thus, transmitting or broadcasting multiple messages simultaneously over a visible light channel without any preprocessing may result in serious collisions. In this paper, we propose a framework to tackle these problems by optical code division multiple access (CDMA) for VLC. With our approach, a VLC receiver can enter an environment without any prior configuration and can be designed with simple hardware.

On the other hand, in order to adapt to the increasingly crowed radio frequency spectrum and prevent mutual interferences, there are also requirements in the waveform spectral shape. That is to say, the waveform must fulfill constraints in both time and frequency domains. In this work, designing these waveforms is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. By introducing auxiliary variable neurons and Lagrange neurons, we solve it using the Lagrange programming neural network. We also analyze the local stability conditions of the dynamic neuron model. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is a competitive alternative for waveform design with unit modulus and arbitrary spectral shapes.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2464178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07174964.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2464178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform Design With Unit Modulus and Spectral Shape Constraints via Lagrange Programming Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Waveform Design With Unit Modulus and Spectral Shape Constraints via Lagrange Programming Neural Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174964/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676866","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7174964/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC 61471295 and 61172123"},{"fundingName":"Research Youth Star of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2012KJXX-35"},{"fundingName":"Henry Fok Foundation","grantNumber":"141119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform Design With Unit Modulus and Spectral Shape Constraints via Lagrange Programming Neural Network","sourcePdf":"jstsp-liang-2464178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093032S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7174964","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7174975,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio J.

We show that if the observations relate to the parameters via Gaussian likelihoods, the F-B priors form a conjugate model that yields closed-form, recursive estimators that naturally take into account the restrictions on the unknowns. We apply this model to a communication setup with multiple gain-controlled FIR frequency-selective channels, deriving a novel maximum a posteriori (MAP) channel parameter estimator and a blind equalizer based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filters.

The benefits of using significantly reduced data are also desirable for moving targets. Hence, we bring CS based multipath exploitation to the non-stationary target domain and are able to treat moving and stationary targets simultaneously. In general, multipath propagation has adverse effects on the image quality. However, by using proper modeling, multipath can be used to one's advantage. In this paper, we apply CS to both stationary and moving targets under interior wall scatterings. Assuming knowledge of the room geometry, we develop an effective method that solves the inverse problem of joint localization and velocity estimation of the targets in an indoor multipath environment from a few measurements. We also propose a computationally inexpensive scheme that first locates the targets using sparse reconstruction and subsequently estimates the velocity vectors. Effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using both simulated and experimental data.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2464177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07174982.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2464177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sensing-Based Multipath Exploitation for Stationary and Moving Indoor Target Localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7174982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing-Based Multipath Exploitation for Stationary and Moving Indoor Target Localization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7174982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676861","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7174982/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sensing-Based Multipath Exploitation for Stationary and Moving Indoor Target Localization","sourcePdf":"jstsp-leigsnering-2464177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13088S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7174982","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7174994,"authors":[{"name":"C.-S.

Nonetheless, most real-world data streams feature highly uncertain characteristics, which cannot be handled by the type-1 EFC. A novel interval type-2 fuzzy classifier, namely evolving type-2 classifier (eT2Class), is proposed in this paper, which constructs an evolving working principle in the framework of interval type-2 fuzzy system. The eT2Class commences its learning process from scratch with an empty or initially trained rule base, and its fuzzy rules can be automatically grown, pruned, recalled, and merged on the fly referring to summarization power and generalization power of data streams. In addition, the eT2Class is driven by a generalized interval type-2 fuzzy rule, where the premise part is composed of the multivariate Gaussian function with an uncertain nondiagonal covariance matrix, while employing a subset of the nonlinear Chebyshev polynomial as the rule consequents. The efficacy of the eT2Class has been rigorously assessed by numerous real-world and artificial study cases, benchmarked against state-of-the-art classifiers, and validated through various statistical tests. Our numerical results demonstrate that the eT2Class produces more reliable classification rates, while retaining more compact and parsimonious rule base than state-of-the-art EFCs recently published in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175005/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16051493","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7175005/","publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolving Type-2 Fuzzy Classifier","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP110103733 and DP140101366"},{"fundingName":"UTS research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving Type-2 Fuzzy Classifier","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-pratama-2463732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096322S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"7480878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7480878","articleId":"7175005","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7175019,"authors":[{"name":"Handing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K.","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education of China, International Research Center of Intelligent Perception and Computation, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7542212/7175019/wang-2459137-small.gif","p":["Handing Wang (S\u201910) received the B.Eng. in intelligence science and technology and Ph.D. degree in circuit and system from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.","She is currently a Research Fellow with the Department of Computing, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K. Her current research interests include nature-inspired computation, multiobjective optimization, multiple criteria decision making, and real-world problems."]},"firstName":"Handing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085510412"},{"name":"Qingfu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, U.K.","Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7542212/7175019/zhang-2459137-small.gif","p":["Qingfu Zhang (M\u201901\u2013SM\u201906) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China, in 1984, and the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1991 and 1994, respectively.","He is a Professor with the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, and the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, U.K., and a Changjiang Visiting Chair Professor with Xidian University.

In our experimental studies, we have compared several state-of-the-art of algorithms with our proposed algorithm on benchmark problems with different levels of noises. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the regularity model on noisy problems, but a degenerated performance on some noisy-free problems.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2459137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7542212/07175019.pdf","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2459137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularity Model for Noisy Multiobjective Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Regularity Model for Noisy Multiobjective Optimization","volume":"46","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"16231743","pubMedId":"26259211","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7175019/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175019/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329402"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC on \u201cDAASE: Dynamic Adaptive Automated Software Engineering,\u201d","grantNumber":"EP/J017515/1"},{"fundingName":"Program for Cheung Kong Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT1170"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61329302, 91438103, 61473241 and 91438201"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)","grantNumber":"B07048"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Regularity Model for Noisy Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wang-2459137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095662S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7542212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7542212","articleId":"7175019","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7175022,"authors":[{"name":"Meysam Namdari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/7353235/7175022/namda-small.gif","p":["Meysam Namdari received the B.S. degree from Tafresh University,\n Markazi, Iran, in 2010, and the M.S. degree from the Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran,\n Iran, in 2013, both in electrical engineering.","His research interests include numerical methods in electromagnetics and electromagnetic compatibility."]},"firstName":"Meysam","lastName":"Namdari","id":"37085762112"},{"name":"Mojtaba Khosravi-Farsani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/7353235/7175022/farsa-small.gif","p":["Mojtaba Khosravi-Farsani was born in Farsan, Iran, in 1986.

Instead of using piecewise linear approximations for the V-I curve of an arrester, as usually done in the literature, we derive new updating equations for calculation of electric field components required at each FDTD time step. This is done in a semi-implicit manner where we first obtain a time-stepping relation of electric field based on the V-I curves of the arresters. The time-stepping relation in each time step is solved by the Newton-Raphson method to update the electric field components. The proposed technique is implemented into a nonuniform parallel FDTD code, which is used to simulate a three-phase distribution line of about 800 m equipped with lightning arresters and a neutral wire, installed at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing at Camp Blanding Florida. The results of FDTD numerical simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data associated with triggered lightning.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2015.2457451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/7353235/07175022.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2015.2457451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353235","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Parallel 3-D FDTD Method for Calculating Lightning-Induced Disturbances on Overhead Lines in the Presence of Surge Arresters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Parallel 3-D FDTD Method for Calculating Lightning-Induced Disturbances on Overhead Lines in the Presence of Surge Arresters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677189","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7175022/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Parallel 3-D FDTD Method for Calculating Lightning-Induced Disturbances on Overhead Lines in the Presence of Surge Arresters","sourcePdf":"temc-sadeghi-2457451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100625S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"7353235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7353235","articleId":"7175022","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7175026,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozhao Fang","affiliation":["Bio-Computing Research Center, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7511816/7175026/fang-2454521-small.gif","p":["Xiaozhao Fang (S\u201915) received the M.S. degree in computer science from the Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2008.

However, in previous LRR-based semi-supervised subspace clustering methods, the label information is not used to guide the affinity matrix construction so that the affinity matrix cannot deliver strong discriminant information. Moreover, these methods cannot guarantee an overall optimum since the affinity matrix construction and subspace clustering are often independent steps. In this paper, we propose a robust semi-supervised subspace clustering method based on non-negative LRR (NNLRR) to address these problems. By combining the LRR framework and the Gaussian fields and harmonic functions method in a single optimization problem, the supervision information is explicitly incorporated to guide the affinity matrix construction and the affinity matrix construction and subspace clustering are accomplished in one step to guarantee the overall optimum. The affinity matrix is obtained by seeking a non-negative low-rank matrix that represents each sample as a linear combination of others. We also explicitly impose the sparse constraint on the affinity matrix such that the affinity matrix obtained by NNLRR is non-negative low-rank and sparse. We introduce an efficient linearized alternating direction method with adaptive penalty to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NNLRR is effective in semi-supervised subspace clustering and robust to different types of noise than other state-of-the-art methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7511816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2454521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7511816/07175026.pdf","startPage":"1828","endPage":"1838","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2454521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Semi-Supervised Subspace Clustering via Non-Negative Low-Rank Representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust Semi-Supervised Subspace Clustering via Non-Negative Low-Rank Representation","volume":"46","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7175026/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16154228","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","pubMedId":"26259210","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370163, 61233011 and 61332011"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Innovation Council","grantNumber":"JCYJ20130329151843309, JCYJ20130329151843309, JCYJ20140417172417174 and CXZZ20140904154910774"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M560264"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Key Innovation Team of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2012KCT-04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Semi-Supervised Subspace Clustering via Non-Negative Low-Rank Representation","sourcePdf":"tcyb-fang-2454521-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136922S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7511816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7511816","articleId":"7175026","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7175031,"authors":[{"name":"Wenfu Xu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7352402/7175031/xu-2464176-small.gif","p":["\n\nWenfu Xu (M'13) received the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2007.","He was a Research Associate with the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, in 2014.

By analyzing the rank degeneracy conditions of the submatrix, singularity configurations are identified. Third, based on the partitioned Jacobian matrix, the kinematics equation is decomposed into two smaller dimension subequations, only one of which (called singular subequation, as determined by the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3\\times(n-3)$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n submatrix) contains singularities. Finally, reduced-order approaches and the singularity parameter optimization (SPO) method are presented to plan the singularity-free trajectories by handling the singular subequation.

The conventional correlation in Hilbert space is statistically optimal in white Gaussian noise. However, its performance significantly degrades in the presence of non-Gaussian noise or clutter. In this paper, two new concepts called \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-correlation and \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-ambiguity functions, which generalize the conventional matched filtering from Hilbert space to \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-space, are proposed. In addition, several important mathematical properties of the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-correlation and \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-ambiguity functions are given and proved. Compared with conventional ambiguity function, the time-frequency concentration of the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-ambiguity function is significantly enhanced, i.e., the delay-Doppler resolution is improved and the sidelobes are suppressed. Based on these two newly defined functions, a family of TDE and JDDE algorithms that are robust against impulsive noise or clutter are developed. Furthermore, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds of TDE and JDDE for non-Gaussian noise with arbitrary probability distribution are derived. Simulation results under several impulsive noise models demonstrate that the performance in terms of robustness, resolution, and estimation accuracy is substantially improved when compared with the conventional matched filtering and fractional lower-order moment based methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"23","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7175034/","accessionNumber":"15568128","displayDocTitle":"Robust Matched Filtering in <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ell_{p}$</tex></formula>-Space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Matched Filtering in <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ell_{p}$</tex></formula>-Space","sourcePdf":"tsp-jiang-2464179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125092S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7307924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7307924","articleId":"7175034","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7175036,"authors":[{"name":"Junbiao Han","affiliation":["ABB U.S. Corporate Research Center, ABB Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7300477/7175036/han-2428435-small.gif","p":["Junbiao Han (S\u201910\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China, in 2004; the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China, in 2008; and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA, in 2014.","He is currently a Consulting Engineer with ABB Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA.

Since the spectrum access and power consumption patterns are interdependent, and the power value harvested from certain environmental sources are spatially correlated, the new power dimension could provide additional information to enhance the spectrum sensing accuracy. In this paper, the Markovian behavior of the primary users is considered, based on which we adopt a hidden input Markov model to specify the primary versus secondary dynamics in the system. Accordingly, we propose a 2-D spectrum and power (harvested) sensing scheme to improve the primary user detection performance, which is also capable of estimating the primary transmit power level. Theoretical and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, in term of the performance gain achieved by considering the new power dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly consider the spectrum and power dimensions for the cognitive primary user detection problem.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7307924/7175037-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","volume":"63","issue":"23","accessionNumber":"15568125","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7175037/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power Versus Spectrum 2-D Sensing in Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Power Versus Spectrum 2-D Sensing in Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-cui-2464191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084993S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7307924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7307924","articleId":"7175037","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7175038,"authors":[{"name":"Yaru Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7175038/fu-2464110-small.gif","p":["\n\nYaru Fu received the Bachelor's degree in telecommunication engineering \nfrom Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China, in 2011 and the Master's degree in communication and information system \nfrom Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

This paper focuses on solving the nonconvex problems and provides a general solution to the resource allocation for relay-enhanced multicarrier systems. An established scenario, namely, a decode-and-forward (DF) relay-assisted orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, is considered, and we formulate the resource allocation as a joint subcarrier pairing, assignment, and power allocation problem, in which heterogeneous users' data rate requirements are also considered. To make the expression of the proposed optimization approaches for the original maximization problem clear, a four-step methodology is given. First, we transform the original nonconvex problem into a standard convex problem by imposing a new constraint of subcarrier allocation index, regardless of the convexity of the objective function. Furthermore, we prove that the optimum resource allocation algorithm (ORAA) for the dual problem of the transformed optimization problem is equivalent to the optimization of the original function. Subsequently, the optimum solution could be obtained by the golden section search method and the iterative resource allocation algorithm. Finally, a suboptimal resource allocation algorithm (SRAA) that solves the primal problem in an asymptotic manner is proposed. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed SRAA achieves comparable performance to the ORAA with satisfied complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2464110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07175038.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2464110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","startPage":"4993","endPage":"5006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimization Methods for Nonconvex Resource Allocation Problems of Decode-and-Forward Relay-Based OFDM Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization Methods for Nonconvex Resource Allocation Problems of Decode-and-Forward Relay-Based OFDM Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141248","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7175038/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB329005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61171094"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization Methods for Nonconvex Resource Allocation Problems of Decode-and-Forward Relay-Based OFDM Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-fu-2464110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085809S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7175038","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7175044,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN","Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7323913/7175044/7175044-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao Fu (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received his B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in communication and information engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.

In addition, the simplified linear and the real nonlinear models in linear zone of current and displacements have not been compared before. In this study, the two most commonly used nonlinear models are analyzed comprehensively to address the lack of nonlinear model analysis in previous research and to seek the most appropriate model for both nonlinear and linear zones (full zone). The results show that no single model completely approximates the test results over the entire zone. A composite model, such as the \u201cswitching model,\u201d is more accurate. To illustrate the applicability of the results to both nonlinear model analysis and the proposed \u201cswitching model,\u201d nonlinear stiffness and performance test experiments were conducted.

The computation load remains the main challenge for the real-time practical application of the NMPC technique, particularly for fast systems. This paper presents a fast NMPC algorithm implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that employs a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle nonlinear optimization. The FPGA is used to explore the possibilities of parallel architecture for the substantial acceleration of NMPC. PSO is employed to achieve real-time operation due to its naturally parallel capabilities. The proposed FPGA-based NMPC-PSO controller consists of a random-number generator, a fixed-point arithmetic, a PSO solver, and a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter communication interface. Then, this controller is applied to an engine idle speed control problem and demonstrated with an FPGA-in-the-loop testbench. The experimental results indicate that the NMPC-on-FPGA-chip strategy has good computational performance and achieves satisfactory control performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7175048/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast Nonlinear Model Predictive Control on FPGA Using Particle Swarm Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2012CB821202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374046, 61403159 and 61520106008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Nonlinear Model Predictive Control on FPGA Using Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tie-xu-2464171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124348S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7352402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7352402","articleId":"7175048","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7175049,"authors":[{"name":"Sangshin Kwak","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7287829/7175049/skwak-2463757-small.gif","p":["Sangshin Kwak (S\u201902\u2013M\u201905) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in 2005.","From 1999 to 2000, he worked as a Research Engineer with LG Electronics, Changwon, South Korea.

By utilizing the two voltages with variable durations, the two proposed MPCC methods can reduce steady-state current errors and decrease output current ripples without increasing the sampling frequency in comparison with the conventional MPCC method, despite only three distinctive output voltages being allowed in the single-phase VSI.

The scheme first relies on a time-domain TS that is identical for all transmit antennas to acquire the partial channel common support by utilizing the spatial correlation property of the MIMO channels and then uses the frequency-domain TS for accurate CSI recovery based on the proposed adaptive spatially-temporally joint simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Here, the obtained partial channel common support can be utilized to reduce the complexity of the classical SCS algorithm and improve the signal recovery probability. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme could significantly reduce the TS overhead and demonstrate better performance than the existing MIMO-OFDM systems, which might be suitable for massive MIMO systems in future fifth-generation communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07175052.pdf","startPage":"5714","endPage":"5719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2463716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2463716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonorthogonal Time\u2013Frequency Training-Sequence-Based CSI Acquisition for MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Correlation","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Time-frequency analysis","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","signal processing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonorthogonal time frequency training sequence","CSI acquisition","MIMO systems","TS","channel state information","CSI acquisition approach","multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","MIMO-OFDM systems","structured compressed sensing","SCS","signal recovery probability","fifth-generation communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel state information (CSI) acquisition","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","nonorthogonal time\u2013frequency training sequence (TS)","spatial\u2013temporal correlations","structured compressed sensing (SCS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Nonorthogonal Time\u2013Frequency Training-Sequence-Based CSI Acquisition for MIMO Systems","volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7175052/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141179","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401248 and 61471219"},{"fundingName":"New Generation Broadband Wireless Mobile Communication Network of the National Science and Technology Major Projects","grantNumber":"2015ZX03002008"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"2014Z06098"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China","grantNumber":"SGHAZZ00FCJS1500238"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonorthogonal Time\u2013Frequency Training-Sequence-Based CSI Acquisition for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2463716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122639S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7175052","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7175053,"authors":[{"name":"Petros Karvelis","affiliation":["Laboratory of Knowledge and Intelligent Computing, Department of Computer Engineering, Technological Educational Institute of Epirus, Artas, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7287829/7175053/karve-2463680-small.gif","p":["Petros Karvelis received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece, in 2001, 2004, and 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctorate Research Fellow with the Knowledge and Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Department of Computer Engineering, Technological Educational Institute of Epirus, Arta, Greece.

Many of them rely on the qualitative interpretation of the results, a fact that requires significant user expertise, and that makes their implementation in portable condition monitoring devices difficult. In this paper, we present an automated method for the detection of the number of broken bars of an induction motor. The method is based on the transient analysis of the start-up current using wavelet approximation signal that isolates a characteristic component that emerges once a rotor bar is broken. After the isolation of this component, a number of stages are applied that transform the continuous-valued signal into a discrete one. Subsequently, an intelligent icon-like approach is applied for condensing the relative information into a representation that can be easily manipulated by a nearest neighbor classifier. The approach is tested using simulation as well as experimental data, achieving high-classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175053/","volume":"11","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7175053/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15489128","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Symbolic Representation Approach for the Diagnosis of Broken Rotor Bars in Induction Motors","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad (MINECO)"},{"fundingName":"FEDER program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002923","fundingName":"Programa Estatal de Fomento de la Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y T\u00e9cnica de Excelencia","grantNumber":"DPI2014-52842-P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Symbolic Representation Approach for the Diagnosis of Broken Rotor Bars in Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"tii-karvelis-2463680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120015S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7287829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7287829","articleId":"7175053","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7175056,"authors":[{"name":"Leibo Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7268793/7175056/7175056-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leibo Liu (A\u201909) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, in 2004.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University.

Without requiring extra backhaul signaling from a macro base station (MBS), a femto base station can update its downlink transmission power by overhearing typical feedback signals from nearby macrocell user equipment (MUE) to the MBS, such as the channel quality indicator and ACK/NAK signals. We analyze the algorithm convergence in detail with respect to instantaneous feedback and discounted sum estimate of the MUE rate. Furthermore, when multiple MUEs with different scheduling probabilities and rate requirements are impacted by the femtocell, we prove that a sufficiently small coefficient \u03c1 used as a discount factor for rate estimate can guarantee the convergence for our SA algorithm. To improve convergence speed and to reduce the sensitivity of our algorithm to the choice of parameter \u03c1, we further present an improved algorithm for the multiple-MUE scenario.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell Power Control for Interference Management Based on Macrolayer Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2463718","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07175060.pdf","startPage":"5222","endPage":"5236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2463718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175060/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell Power Control for Interference Management Based on Macrolayer Feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7175060/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141184","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1307820, CNS-1443870 and CNS-1457060"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell Power Control for Interference Management Based on Macrolayer Feedback","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2463718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156807S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7175060","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7175061,"authors":[{"name":"Chunsheng Liu","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7361014/7175061/cliu-2459594-small.gif","p":["\n\nChunsheng Liu received the B.S. degree in industrial automation and the M.S. degree in pattern recognition and machine intelligence from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

This framework includes three parts: a novel region-of-interest (ROI) extraction method called the high-contrast region extraction (HCRE), the split-flow cascade tree detector (SFC-tree detector), and a rapid occlusion-robust traffic sign classification method based on the extended sparse representation classification (ESRC). Unlike the color-thresholding or extreme region extraction methods used by previous ROI methods, the ROI extraction method of the HCRE is designed to extract ROI with high local contrast, which can keep a good balance of the detection rate and the extraction rate. The SFC-tree detector can detect a large number of different types of traffic signs in high-resolution images quickly. The traffic sign classification method based on the ESRC is designed to classify traffic signs with partial occlusion. Instead of solving the sparse representation problem using an overcomplete dictionary, the classification method based on the ESRC utilizes a content dictionary and an occlusion dictionary to sparsely represent traffic signs, which can largely reduce the dictionary size in the occlusion-robust dictionaries and achieve high accuracy. The experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach, and our TSR framework can rapidly detect and recognize multiclass traffic signs with high accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Traffic Sign Recognition via High-Contrast Region Extraction and Extended Sparse Representation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2459594","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7361014/07175061.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2459594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7361014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast Traffic Sign Recognition via High-Contrast Region Extraction and Extended Sparse Representation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7175061/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669278","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273277 and 61203261"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20130131110038"},{"fundingName":"Project sponsored by SRF for ROCS, SEM","grantNumber":"20101174"},{"fundingName":"Shandong province Natural Science Foundation Committee","grantNumber":"ZR2011FM032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Traffic Sign Recognition via High-Contrast Region Extraction and Extended Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"tits-liu-2459594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087791S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7361014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7361014","articleId":"7175061","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7175063,"authors":[{"name":"Jimmy J.

This paper demonstrates the enhancement of pMTJ free layer (FL) properties through selective engineering of capping materials placed between a CoFeB FL and the top electrode. By introducing a capping layer of Mg or MgO, thermal budget and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio are significantly improved over the conventional FL schemes due to reduced atomic intermixing at interfaces. In full-stack pMTJ films, thin Mg above the FL enables the TMR above 170% after 400 \u00b0C annealing. Capping via MgO increases the interface anisotropy, allowing for the use of thicker CoFeB FLs with magnetic damping constants as low as 0.003. We discuss the implications of these capping layer improvements and suggest that Mg and MgO show the potential for optimizing the FLs with high-thermal budget and good STT efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunneling magnetoresistance","Annealing","Magnetic tunneling","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Damping","Films","Junctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["annealing","boron alloys","cobalt alloys","damping","iron alloys","magnesium compounds","magnetic anisotropy","MRAM devices","optimisation","thermal analysis","thin films","tunnelling magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spin-transfer torque","magnetoresistive random access memory technologies","STT-MRAM free layer films","capping layer engineering","thermal budget","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","magnetic damping parameter","perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction","pMTJ thin films","pMTJ free layer properties","capping materials","tunneling magnetoresistance","TMR ratio","atomic intermixing","annealing","interface anisotropy","magnetic damping constants","temperature 400 degC","MgO","Mg","CoFeB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM)","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA)","perpendicular MTJ (pMTJ)","spin-transfer torque","tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR)"]},{"kwd":["Magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM)","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA)","perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ)","spin-transfer torque (STT)","tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175063","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2463759","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7330079/07175063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2463759","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermally Robust Perpendicular STT-MRAM Free Layer Films Through Capping Layer Engineering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thermally Robust Perpendicular STT-MRAM Free Layer Films Through Capping Layer Engineering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175063/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","volume":"51","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7175063/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","externalId":"3402105","accessionNumber":"15601975","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermally Robust Perpendicular STT-MRAM Free Layer Films Through Capping Layer Engineering","sourcePdf":"tmag-kan-2463759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055883S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7330079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7330079","articleId":"7175063","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7175068,"authors":[{"name":"Yushan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7349281/7175068/liu-2463816-small.gif","p":["\n\nYushan Liu received the B.S. degree in information engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

Using the random connection model, we study the unreliability of wireless secondary links in CR ad hoc networks, which has not been well studied in the existing literature. By introducing two auxiliary random graphs and using continuum percolation theory, we study the impacts of key system parameters on connectivity and transmission delay in a CR network. We first characterize three behavioral regions of connectivity for a secondary network, i.e., disconnectivity, long-term connectivity and instantaneous connectivity regions. We show that the unreliability of secondary links does not affect the disconnectivity region, but affects the long-term connectivity and instantaneous connectivity regions. Using the ergodic theorem, we then study the scaling behavior of transmission delay with respect to the distance between two randomly chosen secondary users in a connected secondary network for two cases. Specifically, when propagation delay is negligible, we show that transmission delay scales linearly and sub-linearly with distance in the long-term connectivity and instantaneous connectivity regions, respectively. When propagation delay is considered, we show that transmission delay scales linearly with respect to distance in both the long-term connectivity and instantaneous connectivity regions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15676960","htmlLink":"/document/7175068/","displayDocTitle":"Connectivity and Transmission Delay in Large-Scale Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks With Unreliable Secondary Links","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF China","grantNumber":"61325012, 61271219, 61221001 and 61428205"},{"fundingName":"China Ministry of Education Doctor Program","grantNumber":"20130073110025"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Basic Research Key Project","grantNumber":"12JC1405200 and 11JC1405100"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai International Cooperation Project","grantNumber":"13510711300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectivity and Transmission Delay in Large-Scale Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks With Unreliable Secondary Links","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2463816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135065S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7175068","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7175069,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaonan Lu","affiliation":["Energy Systems Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7300477/7175069/lu-2455017-small.gif","p":["Xiaonan Lu (S\u201911\u2013M\u201914) was born in Tianjin, China, in 1985.

By considering the impact of each component in dc microgrids on system stability, a multistage configuration is employed, which includes the source stage, interface converter stage between buses, and common load stage. In order to study the overall stability of the above dc microgrid with constant power loads (CPLs), a comprehensive small-signal model is derived by analyzing the interface converters in each stage. The instability issue induced by the CPLs is revealed by using the criteria of impedance matching. Meanwhile, virtual-impedance-based stabilizers are proposed in order to enhance the damping of dc microgrids with CPLs and guarantee the stable operation. Since droop control is commonly used to reach proper load power sharing in dc microgrids, its impact is taken into account when testing the proposed stabilizers. By using the proposed stabilizers, virtual impedances are employed in the output filters of the interface converters in the second stage of the multistage configuration. In particular, one of the virtual impedances is connected in series with the filter capacitor, and the other one is connected at the output path of the converter. It can be seen that by using the proposed stabilizers, the unstable poles induced by the CPLs are forced to move into the stable region. The proposed method is verified by the MATLAB/Simulink model of multistage dc microgrids with three distributed power generation units.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2455017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2455017","startPage":"2770","endPage":"2783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7300477/07175069.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Enhancement Based on Virtual Impedance for DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Stability Enhancement Based on Virtual Impedance for DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15566991","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7175069/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51177083"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Power Systems Tsinghua University, China","grantNumber":"SKLD14M01"},{"fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Enhancement Based on Virtual Impedance for DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads","sourcePdf":"tsg-sun-2455017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.220271S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7300477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"7300477","articleId":"7175069","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7175077,"authors":[{"name":"Atsushi Shirane","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7175077/7175077-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Atsushi Shirane (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics and applied physics from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2010, 2012, and 2015, respectively.","He is currently with Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan.

The IFQB transmitter can produce a quadrature modulated signal without active RF circuits, such as PLL, local generation, and local distribution circuits. Thus, the IFQB technique can significantly reduce the power consumption while achieving denser constellations by the quadrature modulation. The RF-powered transceiver consists of the IFQB transmitter, an OOK receiver, and a power management unit (PMU) for RF powering. The transmitter and receiver operate under a 0.6 V power supply provided by the PMU to further reduce the power consumption. We fabricated a prototype RF-powered transceiver using a 65 nm Si CMOS process to confirm the validity of the proposed technique. During the measurements, the transmitter achieved 2.5 Mb/s with a 32-QAM modulation while consuming 113 \u03bcW. In addition, a wireless temperature sensing demonstration was conducted using the prototype sensor node with the presented RF-powered transceiver.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7336577/07175077.pdf","startPage":"2975","endPage":"2987","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2454235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2454235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7336577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF-Powered Transceiver With an Energy- and Spectral-Efficient IF-Based Quadrature Backscattering Transmitter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"RF-Powered Transceiver With an Energy- and Spectral-Efficient IF-Based Quadrature Backscattering Transmitter","htmlLink":"/document/7175077/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15618369","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006422","fundingName":"Cadence Design Systems"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007053","fundingName":"Mentor Graphics"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF-Powered Transceiver With an Energy- and Spectral-Efficient IF-Based Quadrature Backscattering Transmitter","sourcePdf":"jssc-shirane-2454235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08685S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7336577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7336577","articleId":"7175077","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7175080,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyan Wang","affiliation":["Information Systems Architecture Science Research Division, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7175080/wang-2463686-small.gif","p":["\n\nXiaoyan Wang (S'11\u2013M'14) received the B.E. degree from Beihang \nUniversity, Beijing, China, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Information Systems Architecture Science Research Division, National \nInstitute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan.

The design objective is to improve the secrecy rate of the primary user (PU) and, at the same time, create transmission opportunities for the secondary users (SUs) to satisfy their diversified quality-of-service (QoS) demands. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel nonmonetary trading model, where the users are incentivized to participate in the market by a barter-like resource-to-resource exchange. Specifically, the PU leverages the assistance of the SU in the form of cooperative forwarding or friendly jamming and yields part of the spectrum accessing time to the aided SU. The proposed spectrum auction framework jointly formulates the optimal cooperator selection and the corresponding resource allocation problems by taking into consideration the QoS demands of individual users. The proposed framework ensures that bidding truthfully is the dominant strategy for all bidders and, thus, is invulnerable to market manipulation and eliminates the overhead of strategizing over other bidders. Simulation results reveal that the proposed framework could provide substantial gains for both the PU and the aided SU.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141218","htmlLink":"/document/7175080/","displayDocTitle":"A Nonmonetary QoS-Aware Auction Framework Toward Secure Communications for Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B)","grantNumber":"15K15989"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371118"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonmonetary QoS-Aware Auction Framework Toward Secure Communications for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-ji-2463686-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113305S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7175080","onlineDate":"03 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7175082,"authors":[{"name":"Siavash Moghadami","affiliation":["C.

The z13 system architecture differs from previous high-end z Systems\u2122 designs due to the introduction of a drawer-based processor design, organic single-chip modules (SCMs) in place of the ceramic MCMs (multi-chip modules), and a cabled interconnect between drawers in place of the PCB (printed circuit board) backplane of the zEC12. These innovations are coupled with next-generation signaling interfaces, providing a significant increase in signal bandwidth. The next-generation voltage regulation and decoupling provides the efficient power delivery needed to build a new processor subsystem with 40% more processor cores than the zEC12. The memory bandwidth and capacity have more than tripled, and the input/output bandwidth of the processor chip doubled to provide excellent scalability at the processor socket, drawer, and system level. The electronic packaging has been designed to meet all of these challenges, and this paper presents the design and integration of the electronic packaging of the z13 system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel7/5288520/7175088/07175137.pdf","startPage":"13:1","endPage":"13:12","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2015.2445031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2015.2445031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic packaging of the IBM z13 processor drawer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Electronics packaging","Substrates","Integrated circuit interconnections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Electronic packaging of the IBM z13 processor drawer","volume":"59","issue":"4/5","htmlLink":"/document/7175137/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic packaging of the IBM z13 processor drawer","sourcePdf":"jrd-becker-2445031-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063956S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"7175088","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7175088","articleId":"7175137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":7175232,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Yen-Sheng Chen","id":"37965939100"},{"name":"Ting-Yu Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Ting-Yu Ku","id":"37085519367"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6670-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7673"}],"articleNumber":"7175232","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Antennas","Optimization","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","MIMO communication","optimisation","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple antennas pixelated design","MIMO handset applications","channel throughput enhancement","multiple input multiple output antenna system","antenna geometric parameter fine tuning","multiobjective optimization algorithm","antenna topology","mutual coupling"]}],"abstract":"It is well-known that channel throughput can be greatly enhanced by using a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system. To implement such a multiple-antenna structure in handset environments, conventional design approaches rely on fine tuning the geometric parameters of antenna layouts. In this paper, a completely different framework is implemented to develop the multiple antennas. Rather than tuning the geometric parameters, we discretize the design space into several pixels. Afterward, powerful multi-objective optimization algorithms may automatically find the best antenna topologies by varying the distribution of these pixels. Our preliminary results show that the impedance requirement of each antenna can be met, and the mutual coupling between the multiple antennas can be kept at a very low level Most importantly, all the performances are automatically determined by the pixelated design technique. Therefore, the design cycle can be greatly reduced.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pixelated design for multiple antennas in MIMO handset applications","publicationTitle":"2015 Asia-Pacific Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility (APEMC)","doi":"10.1109/APEMC.2015.7175232","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Asia-Pacific Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility (APEMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167176/7175217/07175232.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEMC.2015.7175232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Pixelated design for multiple antennas in MIMO handset applications","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7175232/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15347553","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pixelated design for multiple antennas in MIMO handset applications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1570049283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093442S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167176","isNumber":"7175217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167176","xplore-issue":"7175217","articleId":"7175232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7175233,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Yen-Sheng Chen","id":"37965939100"},{"name":"Yi-Hsiang Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Yi-Hsiang Chiu","id":"37085621880"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6670-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7673"}],"articleNumber":"7175233","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Genetics","Robustness","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","genetic algorithms","monopole antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","pixelated antenna design problem","GA","orthogonal array","UWB planar monopole antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175233","abstract":"To reduce the design cycle of antenna development, pixelated antenna design becomes a very important approach.

We first formulate the JS2PA problem as a mixed integer programming problem aiming to maximize the total network utility under the constraints of the total and individual power, subcarrier fairness requirement and pairing. To solve the non-convex JS2PA problem, firstly, we propose a subcarrier pairing and selection algorithm based on Hungarian method so as to select the appropriate subcarrier pairs for relaying. Secondly, we provide a power allocation algorithm based on the IWD method (PA-MIWD) in which water drops act as the agents to find the optimal power allocation for each node.

These advances have fundamentally improved and changed our modern world. Essential to this progress is the scalable nature of semiconductor technology and the invention of the integrated circuit (IC) [2, 3]. The IC has become ubiquitous and has had unparalleled impact on our modern world as a result of the ability of semiconductor and transistor technology to continually increase the functionality, performance, and reliability of solid-state circuits, while reducing their size, power, and costs. This scaling has been exponential, resulting in ICs today that contain over a billion transistors per chip with a cost per transistor of <;0.1 microcents. A key value of the IC is the ability to realize many of the aforementioned improvements by eliminating the need to discretely package and assemble individual devices or smaller circuits by providing the device and circuit connections via semiconductor batch and wafer scale processing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Technological innovation","Integrated optics","Transistors","Optical fiber communication","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit reliability","integrated optics","optical communication","wafer-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communications","photonic integrated circuits","minority carrier injection","semiconductor technology","transistor technology","solid-state circuit reliability","device connections","circuit connections","semiconductor batch","wafer scale processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175532","doi":"10.1109/DRC.2015.7175532","startPage":"23","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"2015 73rd Annual Device Research Conference (DRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 73rd Annual Device Research Conference (DRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7165060/7175519/07175532.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRC.2015.7175532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175532/","displayDocTitle":"The past, present, and future of photonic integrated circuits in optical communications","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15362243","htmlLink":"/document/7175532/","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The past, present, and future of photonic integrated circuits in optical communications","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"02324SessionI3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07321S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165060","isNumber":"7175519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165060","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7175519","articleId":"7175532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7175544,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmedullah Aziz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Ahmedullah","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37085589751"},{"name":"Nikhil Shukla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Shukla","id":"38466972100"},{"name":"Suman Datta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Datta","id":"37085420463"},{"name":"Sumeet Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Sumeet Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37279067800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8135-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8134-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3770"}],"articleNumber":"7175544","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Molecular beam applications","Molecular beam epitaxial growth","Standards","Doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chromium","MRAM devices","thermal stability","tunnelling magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["read-write paths","magnetic tunnel junction","MTJ","correlated material","multiport MRAM","insulator-metal transitions","cell tunnelling magnetoresistance","CTMR","read disturb margin","baseline cell","write operation","thermal stability","Cr"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175544","abstract":"Summary form only given.

The minimum squared error method, is one of the methods to minimize the sum of the squared error between the output of the linear function and the desired output, which first obtains the mapping that can best transform the training sample into its class label and then exploits the obtained mapping to predict the class label of the test sample. However, the improved method classifies all the test examples by comparing the difference of predicted class labels of test examples and training examples.

There are three cascade modules for facial age estimation: facial aging feature extraction, dimension reduction (or feature selection) and estimation method. Many existing literatures focus on the first or last module while for an age estimation system, it's also important to construct a reasonable framework. Our work focuses on creating an effective framework by selecting methods for these modules reasonably. Firstly, a BIM (bio-inspired model) is employed to extract facial aging features because it can not only capture discriminative local and global features, but also overcome interferences of some 2D deformations to some extent. Then, LDA (linear discriminant analysis) is used for reducing the BIF (bio-inspired features) to lower dimensions and extracting more discriminative information at the same time. Finally, CS-OHRank (cost-sensitive ordinal hyperplane rank), which tackles with sparse data well and reflects the cumulative attributes of aging, is applied as the estimation method. Experimental results on benchmark dataset FG-NET show that our framework combining BIF, LDA and CS-OHRank is competitive among the state of the art, with MAE (mean absolute error) = 4.72 years..","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial age estimation using bio-inspired features and cost-sensitive ordinal hyperplane rank","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175707","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168380/7175692/07175707.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175692","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Facial age estimation using bio-inspired features and cost-sensitive ordinal hyperplane rank","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7175707/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15347775","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial age estimation using bio-inspired features and cost-sensitive ordinal hyperplane rank","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"015205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07971S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7168380","isNumber":"7175692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168380","xplore-issue":"7175692","articleId":"7175707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7175725,"authors":[{"name":"Linlin Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Linlin Tang","id":"37398812100"},{"name":"Pingfei Ren","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Pingfei Ren","id":"37085557200"},{"name":"Jengshyang Pan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Jengshyang Pan","id":"37085562275"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4719-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4720-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4439-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"7175725","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Load management","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Virtual machining","Software as a service","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved k-subset algorithm","load balance problems","cloud computing","network development process","distributed computing mode","virtualization process","CloudSim platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Load balance","k-subset algorithms","CloudSim"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing has earned more and more attention for its important role in the modern network development process.

Steering beam direction in 3D space can improve useful signal power that user equipments (UEs) received and eliminate interference effectively. In this paper, we focus on how to choose 3D-BF angles of beam and propose a cooperative angle selecting scheme based on maximum signal to leakage plus noise ratio (SLNR) (CAS-MSLNR) to increase sum throughput of Heterogeneous Network (HetNet). In the proposed scheme, 3D-BF angles of every node in the same group node (GN) are chosen preliminarily by centralized coordination method to restrain intra-GN interference.

However, the inter-beam interference can affect the achievable capacity severely. In this paper, we propose a user grouping method for downlink beamforming in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Our method aims to group users according to the severity of inter-beam interference: users which won't cause serious inter-beam interference are allocated into the identical group while users that cause serious inter-beam interference are distributed into different groups. By such method, users in identical group are served simultaneously while users in different groups are served in different time slots.Then we demonstrate that downlink beamforming using our method achieves better performance than using conventional SDM scheme by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175734","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168380/7175692/07175734.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User grouping method for downlink beamforming in massive MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175734/","displayDocTitle":"User grouping method for downlink beamforming in massive MIMO system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15362840","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7175734/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User grouping method for downlink beamforming in massive MIMO system","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"042025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068238S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7168380","isNumber":"7175692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168380","xplore-issue":"7175692","articleId":"7175734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7175735,"authors":[{"name":"Wenwu Li","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenwu Li","id":"37085454738"},{"name":"Chao Li","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chao Li","id":"37085728451"},{"name":"Miyi Duan","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Miyi Duan","id":"37085460011"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4719-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4720-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4439-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"7175735","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Flow graphs","Registers","Interference","Process control","Monitoring","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow graphs","invasive software","safety-critical software","symbol manipulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["obfuscated malicious code detecting method","behavior connection","code obfuscation counter technology","critical code programming","critical code hiding","program logic","control flow graph","stain diffusion","symbolic execution","malicious code extraction","malicious code detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analysis of malicious code","detection of malicious code","stain diffusion"]}],"abstract":"Authors of obfuscated malicious code generally use the code obfuscation counter technology to improve the difficulty of being reversely analyzed for programming and hide critical code, data and program logic.

In this method, malicious acts are described based on the extended control flow graph to improve the descriptive power of self-modifying and obfuscated code. Furthermore, interference from malicious code brought by shell adding and obfuscation is eliminated by combining the method of stain diffusion and symbolic execution.

Due to the penetration complexities and the formation heterogeneity, traditional way such as ROP equations and regression analysis are confined by their limitations in the drilling practices. With the accumulation of the geology data and drilling logs, data-based modelling methods like ANN become powerful tools in modern drilling engineering. This paper proposed a ROP prediction approach based on improved BP neural network technologies. The main idea is to build prediction model of target well from well logs through the improved BP neural network modelling method. During the training process, the traditional BP training algorithm is improved by introducing momentum factor and the dynamical learning rate, which are able to notably increase the speed of converging and obtain better generalization performance. We collect and analyze the well log of the No.104 well in Yuanba, China. The experiment results show that the proposed approach is able to effectively utilize the engineering data, and provide accurate ROP prediction in the areas which have certain amount of data collection.","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175818","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168380/7175692/07175818.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"671","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ROP prediction approach based on improved BP neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A ROP prediction approach based on improved BP neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15347710","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7175818/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ROP prediction approach based on improved BP neural network","confLoc":"Shenzhen","sourcePdf":"126216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05398S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7168380","isNumber":"7175692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168380","xplore-issue":"7175692","articleId":"7175818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7175822,"authors":[{"name":"Dazhong He","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dazhong He","id":"37668967400"},{"name":"Yun Xie","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yun Xie","id":"37085683389"},{"name":"Hua Yu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hua Yu","id":"37085502400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4719-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4720-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4439-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"7175822","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SDRAM","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","computer network reliability","computer network security","DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","multimedia computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow content","dependent packet processing","FPGA","multimedia contents","packet processing capability","network infrastructure","security reasons","packet flow information","flow buffering techniques","DDR SDRAM","CPU instruction pipeline","data hazard","cache for flow content memory","CFC","packet dependency problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Flow Content","Data Hazard","Packet Dependency"]}],"abstract":"Perpetual demand for bandwidth, fueled by the rapid growth of data and multimedia contents, calls for ever-faster packet processing capability in network infrastructure. For management and security reasons, packet flow information are sometimes stored, thus pushing the adoption of flow buffering techniques in various scenarios, e.g., in the architecture of FPGA with DDR SDRAM attached. Unfortunately, as the gap between two packets from the same flow shortens, latter packet write operation on SDRAM may probably neglects the former one, causing wrong flow state, just like the case of data hazard in CPU instruction pipeline.

A typical concern in CR-WSN is energy consumption due to resource-constrained nature of sensor nodes. Moreover, additional energy is consumed in a CR-WSN to support CR-exclusive functionality such as spectrum sensing and switching, which could shorten sensor node lifetime. However, some sensor nodes could receive similar signal due to similar channel condition such that they probably have same spectrum sensing results. Consequently, we propose a clustering based scheme for spectrum sensing in CR-WSN, which reduces energy consumption by involving less nodes in spectrum sensing. With our improved clustering algorithm, sensor nodes are grouped into different sets based on their similarity in sensing result. In order to identify the optimal cluster number, a new objective function, based on new intra-cluster and inter-cluster proximity measures has been proposed in our study. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the energy consumption of sensor node and improve global detection probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175823/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15362845","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7175823/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel clustering-based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel clustering-based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"131057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063088S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7168380","isNumber":"7175692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168380","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7175692","articleId":"7175823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7175886,"authors":[{"name":"Marco De Nadai","affiliation":["University of Trento"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"De Nadai","id":"37085548129"},{"name":"Maarten van Someren","affiliation":["University of Amsterdam"],"firstName":"Maarten","lastName":"van Someren","id":"37992132600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8215-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8214-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7175886","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":459},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Buildings","Temperature distribution","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","energy consumption","neural nets","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term anomaly detection","ARIMA","artificial neural network forecast","waste energy","autoregression","gas consumption values"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method for finding anomalies in gas consumption that can identify causes of wasting energy.

However, most of the canonical classifiers are not well-suited for big data analytics. This is especially vivid in case of distance-based classifiers, where their classification time is prohibitive. Recently, many methods for adapting nearest neighbour classifier for big data were proposed. We investigate simple, yet efficient technique based on random under-sampling of the dataset. As we deal with stationary data, one may assume that a subset of objects will sufficiently capture the properties of given dataset. We propose to build distance-based classifiers on the basis of very small subsamples and then combine them into an ensemble. With this, one does not need to aggregate datasets, only local decisions of classifiers. On the basis of experimental results we show that such an approach can return comparable results to nearest neighbour classifier over the entire dataset, but with a significantly reduced classification time. We investigate the number of sub-samples (ensemble members), that are required for capturing the properties of each dataset. Finally, we propose to apply our sub-sampling based ensemble in a distributed environment, which allows for a further reduction of the computational complexity of nearest neighbour rule for big data.","doi":"10.1109/CYBConf.2015.7175952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBConf.2015.7175952","startPage":"311","endPage":"316","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166676/7175890/07175952.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining nearest neighbour classifiers based on small subsamples for big data analytics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Combining nearest neighbour classifiers based on small subsamples for big data analytics","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7175952/","accessionNumber":"15347440","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7175952/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining nearest neighbour classifiers based on small subsamples for big data analytics","confLoc":"Gdynia, Poland","sourcePdf":"054083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047531S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166676","isNumber":"7175890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166676","xplore-issue":"7175890","articleId":"7175952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7175957,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Huk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Huk","id":"37085584453"},{"name":"Jan Kwiatkowski","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Opole University, Opole, Poland"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","id":"37927820200"},{"name":"Dariusz Konieczny","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"Konieczny","id":"38337806200"},{"name":"Micha\u0142 K\u0119dziora","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Micha\u0142","lastName":"K\u0119dziora","id":"37085567008"},{"name":"Jolanta Mizera-Pietraszko","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Opole University, Opole, Poland"],"firstName":"Jolanta","lastName":"Mizera-Pietraszko","id":"38320511600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8322-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8320-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7175957","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7175957","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Context","Genetic algorithms","Correlation","Data mining","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms","query processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-sensitive text mining","fitness leveling genetic algorithm","contextual processing","information retrieval","HTML Web pages","user supported metadata analysis","automatic inference","knowledge base","content-oriented digital documents analysis","meta-heuristic","genetic algorithms for contextual search","GACS","genetic programming","custom fitness leveling function","contextual queries","retrieval process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data mining","text retrieval","contextual search","genetic programming","fitness leveling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CYBConf.2015.7175957","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166676/7175890/07175957.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF)","startPage":"342","endPage":"347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBConf.2015.7175957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-sensitive text mining with fitness leveling Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"Contextual processing is a great challenge for information retrieval study - the most approved techniques include scanning content of HTML web pages, user supported metadata analysis, automatic inference grounded on knowledge base, or content-oriented digital documents analysis.

The processing of these parallel requests in the DRAM controller greatly affects the memory interference delay experienced by running tasks on the platform. In this paper, we present a new parallelism-aware worst-case memory interference delay analysis for COTS multicore systems. The analysis considers a COTS processor that can generate multiple outstanding requests and a COTS DRAM controller that has a separate read and write request buffer, prioritizes reads over writes, and supports out-of-order request processing. Focusing on LLC and DRAM bank partitioned systems, our analysis computes worst-case upper bounds on memory-interference delays, caused by competing memory requests. We validate our analysis on a Gem5 full-system simulator modeling a realistic COTS multicore platform, with a set of carefully designed synthetic benchmarks as well as SPEC2006benchmarks. The evaluation results show that our analysis produces safe upper bounds in all tested benchmarks, while the current state-of-the-art analysis significantly under-estimates the delays.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 27th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174816/7175989/07176037.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"2015 27th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2015.24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2015.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7176037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelism-Aware Memory Interference Delay Analysis for COTS Multicore Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Delays","Multicore processing","Interference","Watermarking","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","DRAM chips","multiprocessing systems","parallel memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commercial off-the-shelf multicore systems","COTS multicore systems","parallel memory requests","parallel requests processing","parallelism-aware worst-case memory interference delay analysis","COTS processor","COTS DRAM controller","read request buffer","write request buffer","out-of-order request processing","LLC","DRAM bank partitioned systems","worst-case upper bounds","Gem5 full-system simulator modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["COTS multicore","memory interference","DRAM","memory controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7176037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Parallelism-Aware Memory Interference Delay Analysis for COTS Multicore Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7176037/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15363206","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelism-Aware Memory Interference Delay Analysis for COTS Multicore Systems","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"7570a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094757S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174816","isNumber":"7175989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174816","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7175989","articleId":"7176037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7176074,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zheng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38468719500"},{"name":"Shouhui Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, China"],"firstName":"Shouhui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085676159"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8085-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8086-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7176074","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Scheduling","Processor scheduling","Schedules","Time-frequency analysis","Computational modeling","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadline constrained energy-efficient scheduling","cloud services","cloud computing","service level agreement","energy consumption reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7176074","abstract":"There is an increasing interest for cloud services to be provided in a more energy efficient way. The growing deployment of large-scale, complex workflow applications onto cloud computing hosts is being faced with crucial challenges in reducing the power consumption without violating the service level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we consider cloud hosts which can operate in different power states with different capacities respectively, and propose a novel scheduling heuristic for workflows to reduce energy consumption while still meeting deadline constraint. The proposed heuristic is evaluated using simulation with four different real-world applications. The observed results indicates that our heuristic does significantly outperform the existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/CBD.2014.18","publicationTitle":"2014 Second International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Second International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077868/7176054/07176074.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBD.2014.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7176054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deadline Constrained Energy-Efficient Scheduling for Workflows in Clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deadline Constrained Energy-Efficient Scheduling for Workflows in Clouds","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15398880","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7176074/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7176074/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deadline Constrained Energy-Efficient Scheduling for Workflows in Clouds","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"8085a069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050864S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7077868","isNumber":"7176054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077868","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7176054","articleId":"7176074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7176077,"authors":[{"name":"LI Kun-lun","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"LI","lastName":"Kun-lun","id":"37085627905"},{"name":"Wang Jun","affiliation":["Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei, CN"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Jun"},{"name":"Song Jian","affiliation":["Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei, CN"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Jian"},{"name":"Dong Qing-yun","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Qing-yun","id":"37085616501"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8085-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8086-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7176077","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"abstract":"Since the resources stored in the cloud is huge and the cost of each task in cloud resources is different, the simple Round Robin algorithm and FIFO algorithm for task scheduling can't met the growing scale of cloud computing. The traditional GA algorithm for task scheduling, which has the defect of premature convergence, only takes the time cost into consideration, but ignores the consumption of resources. In order to solve the problems exists in multi-task scheduling in cloud computing mentioned above, we propose an improved GEP algorithm with double fitness functions (DF-GEP), and also constructs a new ETCC matrix which not only considers the running time of all tasks, but also takes the running cost of the tasks into consideration. This improved algorithm reduces the optimization time, and falls into the local optimal solution hardly at the same time. This improved algorithm expresses a good convergence, through experiments compared with GA and ordinary GEP algorithm by using the Map/Reduce programming model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Second International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077868/7176054/07176077.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"2014 Second International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data","doi":"10.1109/CBD.2014.53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBD.2014.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7176054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7176077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved GEP Algorithm for Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Cloud computing","Processor scheduling","Virtual machining","Sociology","Statistics","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","convergence","genetic algorithms","matrix algebra","multiprogramming","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GEP algorithm","cloud computing","cloud resources","MapReduce programming model","optimization time","ETCC matrix","DF-GEP","double fitness function","multitask scheduling","premature convergence","GA algorithm","FIFO algorithm","round robin algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing; GEP Algorithm; ETC Matrix;"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7176077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Improved GEP Algorithm for Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7176077/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15398862","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved GEP Algorithm for Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"8085a093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071028S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7077868","isNumber":"7176054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077868","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7176054","articleId":"7176077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7176083,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085644720"},{"name":"Xiang Fei","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Fei","id":"37085641552"},{"name":"Sheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085651846"},{"name":"Xin Lu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085644775"},{"name":"Guoqin Jin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Guoqin","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085647839"},{"name":"Weidong Li","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Li","id":"37404630800"},{"name":"Xuyang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Xuyang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085636458"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8085-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8086-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7176083","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Artificial neural networks","Manufacturing","Data models","Noise","Detection algorithms","Storms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised numerical control","condition monitoring","data handling","energy consumption","milling","milling machines","parallel processing","pattern recognition","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption data","machine anomaly detection","energy consumption information","Syil X4 CNC milling machine","computer numerical control milling machine","machining tasks","Storm","Hadoop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","energy consumption","manufacturing","artificial neural network","Hadoop","Storm"]}],"abstract":"The ever increasing of product development and the scarcity of the energy resources that those manufacturing activities heavily rely on have made it of great significance the study on how to improve the energy efficiency in manufacturing environment.

To ensure a good level of security, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been widely deployed and many techniques to detect, identify and classify attacks have been proposed, developed and tested either offline or online. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based detection technique using a genetic algorithm named Genetic Clustering for Anomaly-based Detection (GC-AD). GC-AD uses a dissimilarity measure to form k clusters. It, then, applies a genetic process where each chromosome represents the centroids of the k clusters. A two-stage fitness function is proposed. i) We introduce a confidence interval to refine the clusters in order to obtain partitions that are more homogeneous. ii) We compute and maximize the inter-cluster variance over the generations. The accuracy of our technique is tested on different subset from KDD99 dataset. The results are discussed and compared to k-means clustering algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7159154/7176160/07176182.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7176160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7176182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic clustering technique for Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Genetics","Clustering algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Genetic algorithms","Intrusion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","pattern clustering","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic clustering technique","anomaly-based intrusion detection systems","network resources security","computer systems","IDS","clustering-based detection technique","genetic algorithm","GC-AD","dissimilarity measure","two-stage fitness function","KDD99 dataset","k-means clustering algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly-based IDS","clustering","genetic algorithm","false positive rate","false negative rate","KDD 99"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7176182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A genetic clustering technique for Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7176182/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15359590","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic clustering technique for Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems","confLoc":"Takamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070442S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7159154","isNumber":"7176160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7159154","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7176160","articleId":"7176182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7176193,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This integration reduces I/O access times to typically slow block devices; however, it is unrealistic to construct a large capacity main memory with a single NVM at this time, because NVM have disadvantages regarding write access. Combining NVM and other memory devices is necessary to hide such disadvantages. In particular, we should place writehot data on DRAM and write-cold data on NVM. For data placement, programming language runtime supports are useful, since they have more detailed information about write access than the operating system. A previous study proposed a method to manage NVM/DRAM hybrid memory with programming language runtime supports, determining data placement based on the number of write accesses to each object (i.e., the individual counting method); however, this approach has two problems, namely memory efficiency and determination of threshold values for data placements. The Most Recent Write (MRW) queue method is an alternative method to distinguish between write-hot data and write-cold data. MRW queue manages the frequency of write accesses to objects. In this study, we discuss the problems of the individual counting method and show solutions using the MRW queue approach. Results of our experimentation show that the MRW queue method improves memory efficiency and reduces overhead of the individual counting method.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176226","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7159154/7176160/07176226.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7176160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NVM/DRAM hybrid memory management with language runtime support via MRW queue","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7176226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"NVM/DRAM hybrid memory management with language runtime support via MRW queue","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7176226/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15359634","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NVM/DRAM hybrid memory management with language runtime support via MRW queue","confLoc":"Takamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056382S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7159154","isNumber":"7176160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7159154","xplore-issue":"7176160","articleId":"7176226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7176227,"authors":[{"name":"Hirotaka Kawata","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Kawata","id":"37085520969"},{"name":"Shuichi Oikawa","affiliation":["Division of Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Shuichi","lastName":"Oikawa","id":"37276927100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8676-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7176227","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental design of high performance non volatile main memory swapping using DRAM","abstract":"The mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are increasing processor speed and they are desired more energy.

Thus, it is possible to replace the DRAM of the main memory by the NVM, it is possible to achieve reducing the power consumption.

Mining is the fundamental concept in Bitcoin which must be done in checking all monetary transactions and verifying them which in return generates Bitcoin as a reward to encourage this work. While the qualitative nature of this unique system is clearly accepted and understood, there are some issues regarding to its decentralized network environment. Based on our analysis due to the high variance of solo mining, the number of users joining top most famous Bitcoin mining pools are increasing due to the fact that users together under a Bitcoin pool will have a higher chance of generating next block in the Bitcoin's blockchain by reducing the variance and earning the mining reward. Furthermore, emerging huge mining farms with strong mining resources and fast processing power is another trend toward centralization. Although some might argue that, the protocol itself is purely decentralized and these are marketbased centralization, this trend clearly illustrates that the pure, decentralized protocol of Bitcoin is going toward centralization in its distributed network, where any kind of centralization should be considered carefully due to the 51% attack. By analysing all the created blocks from 2009 to 2014 we proposed a centralization factor which shows how centralized is the state of Bitcoin's network in different years. Centralization, due its simplicity, is a phenomenon that happens to any disciplined and organized system automatically, which in case of Bitcoin is against the pure initial decentralized nature of it and might arise some concerns and threats to the Bitcoin's unforeseeable future.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trend of centralization in Bitcoin's distributed network","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176229","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7159154/7176160/07176229.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7176160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7176229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7176229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Trend of centralization in Bitcoin's distributed network","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7176229/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15359637","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trend of centralization in Bitcoin's distributed network","confLoc":"Takamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072802S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7159154","isNumber":"7176160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7159154","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7176160","articleId":"7176229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7176384,"authors":[{"name":"V L Shivraj","affiliation":["TCS Innovation Labs, Bangalore 560 066, India"],"firstName":"V L","lastName":"Shivraj"},{"name":"M A Rajan","affiliation":["TCS Innovation Labs, Bangalore 560 066, India"],"firstName":"M A","lastName":"Rajan"},{"name":"Meena Singh","affiliation":["TCS Innovation Labs, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Meena","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085422218"},{"name":"P Balamuralidhar","affiliation":["TCS Innovation Labs, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"P","lastName":"Balamuralidhar","id":"37391532000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7626-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7625-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7176384","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2043},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Algorithm design and analysis","Servers","Protocols","Elliptic curves","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","message authentication","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["password authentication","Internet of Things","IoT","end-to-end authentication","one time password","OTP","identity based elliptic curve cryptography"]}],"abstract":"Establishing end-to-end authentication between devices and applications in Internet of Things (IoT) is a challenging task. Due to heterogeneity in terms of devices, topology, communication and different security protocols used in IoT, existing authentication mechanisms are vulnerable to security threats and can disrupt the progress of IoT in realizing Smart City, Smart Home and Smart Infrastructure, etc. To achieve end-to-end authentication between IoT devices/applications, the existing authentication schemes and security protocols require a two-factor authentication mechanism. Therefore, as part of this paper we review the suitability of an authentication scheme based on One Time Password (OTP) for IoT and proposed a scalable, efficient and robust OTP scheme. Our proposed scheme uses the principles of lightweight Identity Based Elliptic Curve Cryptography scheme and Lamport's OTP algorithm. We evaluate analytically and experimentally the performance of our scheme and observe that our scheme with a smaller key size and lesser infrastructure performs on par with the existing OTP schemes without compromising the security level. Our proposed scheme can be implemented in real-time IoT networks and is the right candidate for two-factor authentication among devices, applications and their communications in IoT.","doi":"10.1109/NSITNSW.2015.7176384","publicationTitle":"2015 5th National Symposium on Information Technology: Towards New Smart World (NSITNSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 5th National Symposium on Information Technology: Towards New Smart World (NSITNSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7155754/7176382/07176384.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSITNSW.2015.7176384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7176382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One time password authentication scheme based on elliptic curves for Internet of Things (IoT)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7176384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7176384/","displayDocTitle":"One time password authentication scheme based on elliptic curves for Internet of Things (IoT)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15346570","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7176384/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One time password authentication scheme based on elliptic curves for Internet of Things (IoT)","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"edasfinal1570068029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064016S","chronDate":"17-19 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7155754","isNumber":"7176382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7155754","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7176382","articleId":"7176384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7176391,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid A.

Hence, there has been a growing interest to create easy-to-use interfaces by directly utilizing the natural communication and management skills of humans. This paper presents a hand gesture interface for controlling media player using neural network. The proposed algorithm recognizes a set of four specific hand gestures, namely: Play, Stop, Forward, and Reverse. Our algorithm is based on four phases, Image acquisition, Hand segmentation, Features extraction, and Classification. A frame from the webcam camera is captured, and then skin detection is used to segment skin regions from background pixels. A new image is created containing hand boundary. Hand shape features extraction, are used to describe the hand gesture. An artificial neural network has been utilized as a gesture classifier, as well. 120 gesture images have been used for training. The obtained average classification rate is 95%. The proposed algorithm develops an alternative input device to control the media player, and also offers different gesture commands and can be useful in real-time applications.

It kills more than two million people yearly, therefore, pathogenic disease is the highest disease burden as its rank is one out of four main diseases that threaten human lives. Pathogenic disease contributes to other worldwide severe diseases, such as pneumonia and causes infections such as typhoid fever, which is difficult to control at late stages. This work presents a CMOS biosensor based CBCM system that uses phage organisms to detect bacteria for different applications. The system provides a viable alternative to traditional growth-based bacterial analysis systems, which are time consuming. The system employs an interdigitated capacitor structure, charge based capacitance measurement circuitry to detect, and process capacitance changes in the presence of targeted bacteria.

In D2D-enabled networks, devices help hasten the recovery of the lost packets of devices in their transmission range by sending network coded packets. To solve the problem, the different events occurring at each device are identified so as to derive an expression for the probability distribution of the decoding delay. The joint optimization problem over the set of transmitting devices and the packet combinations of each is formulated. Due to the high complexity of finding the optimal solution, this paper focuses on cooperation without interference between the transmitting users. The optimal solution, in such interference-less scenario, is expressed using a graph theory approach by introducing the cooperation graph. Extensive simulations compare the decoding delay experienced in the Point to Multi-Point (PMP), the fully connected D2D (FC-D2D) and the more practical partially connected D2D (PC-D2D) configurations and suggest that the PC-D2D outperforms the FC-D2D in all situations and provides an enormous gain for poorly connected networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Network Coding (NetCod)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172790/7176630/07176779.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Network Coding (NetCod)","doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2015.7176779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2015.7176779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7176630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7176779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay reduction in multi-hop device-to-device communication using network coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Decoding","Network coding","Indexes","Conferences","Optimization","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","delays","graph theory","network coding","radio equipment","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay reduction","multihop device-to-device communication","network coding","broadcast delay","wireless networks","instantly decodable network coding","IDNC","device-to-device communications","D2D communications","D2D enabled networks","sending network coded packets","probability distribution","decoding delay","transmitting devices","packet combinations","transmitting users","graph theory","cooperation graph","point to multi-point","PMP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Instantly decodable network coding","Device-todevice communications","Fully and Partially connected networks","Delay reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7176779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Delay reduction in multi-hop device-to-device communication using network coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7176779/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347911","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay reduction in multi-hop device-to-device communication using network coding","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p6-douik.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066061S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172790","isNumber":"7176630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172790","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7176630","articleId":"7176779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177035,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Viet Nguyen","affiliation":["Telecom Faculty 1, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7331734/7177035/nguye-2464300-small.gif","p":["\n\nHung Viet Nguyen received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and telecommunications from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1999, the M.Eng. degree in telecommunications from Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Bangkok, Thailand, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2013.

We explicitly consider the pilot contamination effect during the channel estimation in the SEE maximization problem, which aims to optimize the power allocation, the number of activated antennas, and the pilot assignment. To tackle the SEE maximization problem, we transform it into a subtractive form, which can be solved more efficiently. In particular, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the transformed problem where optimization of power allocation and number of antennas is performed, and then pilot assignment optimization is conducted sequentially in each iteration. To tackle the first sub-problem, we employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to attain a solvable convex optimization problem. Moreover, we propose a novel iterative low-complexity algorithm based on the Hungarian method to solve the pilot assignment sub-problem. We also describe how the proposed solution approach can be useful to address the sum rate (SR) maximization problem. In addition to the algorithmic developments, we characterize the optimal structure of both SEE and SR maximization problems. The numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms, impacts of different parameters on the SR and SEE, and significant performance gains of the proposed solution compared the conventional design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation Optimization in Multi-User Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Networks Considering Pilot Contamination","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2464352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07177037.pdf","startPage":"1272","endPage":"1287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2464352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation Optimization in Multi-User Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Networks Considering Pilot Contamination","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7177037/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15352004","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Resource Allocation Optimization in Multi-User Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Networks Considering Pilot Contamination","sourcePdf":"access-ha-2464352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198048S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7177037","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177038,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Yi","affiliation":["Radio Detection Research Center, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China","Collaborative Innovation Center for Geospatial Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7327073/7177038/7177038-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianxin Yi was born in Hunan, China, in 1989.

This is also the case for MIMO passive radar when the transmitters occupy non-overlapping frequency channels, such as the FM-based MIMO passive radar. For the single frequency network (SFN)-based MIMO passive radar (SMPR), all illuminators transmit the same content at the same frequency simultaneously, that makes the signal indistinguishable. Therefore, one has to solve the measurement-to-transmitter association herein in addition to the standard measurement-to-target association in conventional MIMO radars. This paper investigates the non-standard target tracking for SMPR. A novel approach is proposed to achieve real-time operation as well as nearly optimal performance. Simulation results show comparable performance to the case with known association. Moreover, the feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated using field experimental data.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2464188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07177038.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2464188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","startPage":"1661","endPage":"1671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Passive Radar Tracking Under a Single Frequency Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Passive Radar Tracking Under a Single Frequency Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676877","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7177038/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331012, 61371197, U1333106 and 61271400"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Passive Radar Tracking Under a Single Frequency Network","sourcePdf":"jstsp-wan-2464188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094271S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7327073","articleId":"7177038","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177053,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The tag is composed by a UWB antenna connected to a transmission line, in turn loaded with a biomorphic thermal switch. The working principle consists of detecting the impedance change of the thermal switch. This change occurs when the temperature exceeds a threshold. A UWB radar is used as the reader. The difference between the actual time sample and a reference signal obtained from the averaging of previous samples is used to determine the switch transition and to mitigate the interferences derived from clutter reflections. A gain compensation function is applied to equalize the attenuation due to propagation loss.

Therefore, this paper describes and analyzes a novel framework, based on convex optimization, for simultaneously identifying multiple features from superimposed signals. This work adequately exploits the underlying prior information that multiple faults with similar frequency spectrum have different morphological waveforms that can be sparsely represented over the union of redundant dictionaries. Within this framework, prior information is formulated into regularization terms, and a sparse optimization problem, which can be solved through the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), is proposed. Meanwhile, the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed iterative framework are profoundly investigated. Moreover, sensitivity analyses and adaptive selection rules for the regularization parameters are described in detail through a set of comprehensive numerical studies. The proposed framework is validated through performing the diagnosis of multiple faults for gearbox in a wind farm. The comparison with respect to the state of the art in the field is illustrated in detail, which highlights the superiority of the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2464297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7247793/07177057.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2464297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247793","startPage":"6594","endPage":"6605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Feature Identification Based on Union of Redundant Dictionary for Wind Turbine Gearbox Fault Diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Feature Identification Based on Union of Redundant Dictionary for Wind Turbine Gearbox Fault Diagnosis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177057/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15433126","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177057/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51225501 and 51335006"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB057400"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Feature Identification Based on Union of Redundant Dictionary for Wind Turbine Gearbox Fault Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2464297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083906S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7247793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"7247793","articleId":"7177057","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177061,"authors":[{"name":"Huaiyin Lu","affiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huaiyin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085706089"},{"name":"Lin Zhang","affiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute, Shunde, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-5303-0639","id":"38107276200"},{"name":"Ming Jiang","affiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute, Shunde, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085386601"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Wu","affiliation":["Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085674267"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7177061","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":651},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaotic communication","Bit error rate","Manganese","Receivers","Cognitive radio","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-security chaotic cognitive radio system","subcarrier shifting","chaotic sequences","system security","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaotic cognitive radio","chaos-subcarrier pair","subcarrier shifting","high security"]},{"kwd":["Chaotic cognitive radio","chaos-subcarrier pair","subcarrier shifting","high security"]}],"abstract":"Chaotic sequences have been applied to cognitive radio (CR) systems to enhance the system security. However, since the chaotic maps are publicly known, attackers may derive the key parameters of chaotic sequences, then finally retrieve the information. In this paper, we present a new subcarrier-shifting based chaotic cognitive radio (SSCCR) scheme for improving the security mechanism of chaotic cognitive radio (CCR) systems. More specifically, we propose to transmit the information with the chaos-subcarrier pair by combining the chaotic sequence with available subcarriers, where the chaos-subcarrier pairs dynamically change with shifted subcarriers. The subcarrier shifting rule is determined by another chaotic sequence for security enhancement. With the developed mathematical model, we analytically derive its bit error rate (BER) formula. Simulation results are compared to verify the effectiveness of our derivations, and the information leakages of SSCCR and CCR systems are studied. It is demonstrated that the proposed SSCCR system offers a high security and the malicious attackers can not retrieve the transmitted information even if they get the key chaos parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Security Chaotic Cognitive Radio System With Subcarrier Shifting","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2464214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7294672/07177061.pdf","startPage":"1726","endPage":"1729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2464214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"High-Security Chaotic Cognitive Radio System With Subcarrier Shifting","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7177061/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520371","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Normal Project","grantNumber":"20150207"},{"fundingName":"Pilot Project","grantNumber":"20140101"},{"fundingName":"SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Security Chaotic Cognitive Radio System With Subcarrier Shifting","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-2464214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054466S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7294672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7294672","articleId":"7177061","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177062,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In literature, most of the work is done to improve the error performance of the orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBCs) using feedback of CSI from the receiver to the transmitter. In this letter, we study the performance of non-orthogonal space-time block codes (NOSTBCs) in a 2 \u00d7 1 multiple-input single-output system with diagonal weighting scheme; this scheme utilizes quantized one bit feedback with no delay from the receiver in a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel. The considered NOSTBCs are Golden code and Silver code. Error-tolerant diagonal weighting parameter which improves the pair wise error probability (PEP) of the receiver is derived. The PEP performance of the considered set-up is studied for the complex-valued constellation like quadrature amplitude modulation. Simulation results indicate that similar to OSTBCs, the error performance of the NOSTBCs also improves with the proposed diagonal precoding scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7295645/07177063.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2464220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2464220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7295645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One Bit Feedback Based Diagonal Precoding for Non-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silver","Block codes","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","probability","Rayleigh channels","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one bit feedback based diagonal precoding","nonorthogonal space-time block codes","quantized feedback","channel state information","CSI","MIMO systems","OSTBC","orthogonal space time block codes","NOSTBC","multiple-input single-output system","diagonal weighting scheme","quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel","golden code","silver code","error-tolerant diagonal weighting parameter","pair wise error probability","PEP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedback","Golden code","NOSTBC","PEP","Silver code"]},{"kwd":["Feedback","golden code","NOSTBC","PEP","silver code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"One Bit Feedback Based Diagonal Precoding for Non-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes","volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7177063/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520443","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"Government of India","grantNumber":"SB/S3/EECE/0179/2013"},{"fundingName":"\u201cPath Selection in Multi-Hop Cooperative Wireless Networks: Algorithm Design and Hardware Implementation\u201d","grantNumber":"SB/S3/EECE/0179/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One Bit Feedback Based Diagonal Precoding for Non-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes","sourcePdf":"lwc-bhatnagar-2464220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049873S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7295645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7295645","articleId":"7177063","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177066,"authors":[{"name":"Trang Ngoc Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Trang Ngoc","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085736986"},{"name":"Dung Phuong Trinh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Dung Phuong","lastName":"Trinh","id":"37085676429"},{"name":"Youngmin Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngmin","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37577459600"},{"name":"Hyundong Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyundong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37287623300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7177066","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":577},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We consider anomalous diffusion to model a molecular communication channel.

With an embedded image database, a single MDRU can provide the safety confirmation application that allows users to search for the images that look similar to the people they are looking for. However, a network with multiple MDRUs may increase the image searching time of the safety confirmation application because the image databases are distributed and the capacity of the backbone wireless network constructed by connecting the MDRUs is also limited. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a safety confirmation method that guarantees the minimum searching time of users. The method includes four phases, namely, resizing and storing images, broadcasting small-size images, routing, and deciding image size to deliver to users. Based on mathematical analysis using the absorbing Markov chain, we estimate the expected searching time for each different size of images and choose the most appropriate size. Furthermore, we conduct extensive computer-based simulations to verify the findings of our analysis. The simulation results prove the existence of the optimal image size that minimizes the searching time and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Safety Confirmation Method Using Image Database in Multiple-MDRU-Based Disaster Recovery Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2457777","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8118221/07177070.pdf","startPage":"2556","endPage":"2565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2457777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177070/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Safety Confirmation Method Using Image Database in Multiple-MDRU-Based Disaster Recovery Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7177070/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390246","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"national program Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program"},{"fundingName":"Cabinet Office of the Government of Japan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Safety Confirmation Method Using Image Database in Multiple-MDRU-Based Disaster Recovery Network","sourcePdf":"jsyst-ngo-2457777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148336S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8118221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8118221","articleId":"7177070","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177072,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The variation in group index between cores of the fiber is minimized to allow simultaneously launched sub-pulses to arrive at the distal end of the fiber synchronously. Minimization of group index variation between cores is achieved at a V parameter of 3 owing to a turning point in the relationship between the group index and V parameter. For synchronized arrival times, single-mode propagation is important. By tapering a short length of the fiber at the launch end, the V value is locally brought below 2.405 allowing a pure fundamental mode to be launched into each core.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177072/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15489459","volume":"27","issue":"22","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Group Index Variations in a Multicore Endoscope Fiber","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Healthcare Engineering Challenge","grantNumber":"EP/K020102/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Group Index Variations in a Multicore Endoscope Fiber","sourcePdf":"lpt-roper-2464377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047732S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7283730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7283730","articleId":"7177072","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7177073,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Michel Antolovic","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7365508/7177073/antol-2458295-small.gif","p":["Ivan Michel Antolovic received the master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering and information technology from the University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia, in 2012.

single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) technology has steadily advanced, improving noise, timing resolution, and sensitivity, spatial resolution has been increasing as well. The increase in the number of pixels has made a comprehensive analysis of nonuniformity and its effects meaningful, allowing a more accurate comparison of SPAD imagers with other high-end scientific imagers, such as electron multiplying charge-coupled device and scientific CMOS. A comprehensive nonuniformity analysis was conducted on a 512 \u00d7 128 pixel gated SPAD imager, where dark noise, afterpulsing, crosstalk, signal response, and shot noise were measured. This analysis has led to a variety of postprocessing algorithms to improve the linearity of the response as for example required by ground state depletion microscopy-based superresolution microscopy and other techniques. We derived a new correction formula for the count rate applicable to 1-b SPAD imagers, and we measured a significant improvement of photon detection efficiency using microlenses. These techniques were used to validate the suitability of the imager in fluorescence microscopy examples.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2458295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7365508/07177073.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7365508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2458295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniformity Analysis of a 65-kpixel CMOS SPAD Imager","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniformity Analysis of a 65-kpixel CMOS SPAD Imager","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177073/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15716137","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177073/","volume":"63","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Dutch Technology Foundation STW"},{"fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003958","fundingName":"Technologiestichting STW"},{"fundingName":"SwissEx Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniformity Analysis of a 65-kpixel CMOS SPAD Imager","sourcePdf":"ted-antolovic-2458295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116836S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7365508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7365508","articleId":"7177073","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7177080,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Seung Ahn","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Seung","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37285028500"},{"name":"Sung-Woo Choi","affiliation":["Information Communications Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Woo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292421200"},{"name":"Jae-Min Ahn","affiliation":["Information Communications Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Min","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37290861200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7177080","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Performance of Maximum Ratio Diversity With Channel Estimation Error","abstract":"In this letter, we analyze the performance of maximum-ratio combining (MRC) system with channel estimation error for physical layer security.

However, the massive MIMO deployed at base stations (BSs) or relay stations (RSs) brings new challenges on channel state information (CSI) feedback because of its large-scale complex channel matrix. In this paper, we propose a hybrid limited feedback with selective eigenvalue information (HLFSEI), which adopts the individual quantized feedback and the codebook-based feedback jointly. In HLFSEI, we feed back only selective eigenvalue elements for power allocation by individual quantized feedback and the precoding matrix by codebook-based feedback. Furthermore, we study the optimal feedback bit allocation of the aforementioned two feedback methods to minimize the throughput loss with the feedback-link capacity constraint.

Thus, these techniques create a mechanism that can tradeoff some uplink capacity for increased downlink capacity. In this paper, we quantify this tradeoff and study the exchange ratio between the feedback rate (over the uplink) and the downlink rate. We study both finite and infinite networks and show that for high enough (but finite) SNR, the uplink rate can be exchanged for increased downlink rate with a favorable exchange ratio. This exchange ratio is an increasing function of the channel coherence time, and a decreasing function of the number of measured base stations. We also show that in finite networks, devoting a constant fraction of the uplink to CSI feedback can increase the downlink multiplexing gain continuously from 0 to 1, as a function of the fraction size. On the other hand, in infinite networks (with infinite connectivity) our lower bound is only able to show doubly logarithmic scaling of the rate with SNR. The presented results prove that the adaptation of the feedback rate can control the balance between the uplink and downlink rates. This capability is very important in modern cellular networks, where the operators need to respond to continuously changing user demands.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177090/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15568127","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Downlink Rate Balancing in Cooperating Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Downlink Rate Balancing in Cooperating Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-bergel-2464184-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08974S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7307924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7307924","articleId":"7177090","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177091,"authors":[{"name":"Lanhua Zhang","affiliation":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7177091/zhang-small.gif","p":["Lanhua Zhang (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in\n electrical engineering from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

Due to the good dynamics of the parabolic current control, it can be employed in voltage source inverters to improve the system performance such as minimizing the distortion of current waveforms or voltage waveforms. To implement the parabolic current control, a current sensor is required, associated with the current conditioning circuit and parabolic carrier generators. Since the parabolic current control is based on the real-time information of the inductor current, any phase delay or propagation delay of the sensor itself and the conditioning circuitry, or limited resolution of parabolic carrier generators, could impact the current control performance. Since the parabolic current control compares analog signals to generate the required control signals, noise from the control board impacts the control precision as well. This paper will explore solutions to these problems. First, the inductor current of the voltage source inverter is analyzed and the parabolic current control strategy is studied, then a sensorless parabolic current control method is proposed. The new sensorless parabolic control method utilizes a current emulator to rebuild the inductor current on a microcontroller. To avoid a dc offset on the ac-side output voltage caused by the current emulator, an additional control loop in the current emulator is added. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is experimentally verified by the use of an H-bridge voltage source inverter.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2464292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7352399/07177091.pdf","startPage":"3913","endPage":"3921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2464292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sensorless implementation of the parabolic current control for single-phase stand-alone inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177091/","displayDocTitle":"A sensorless implementation of the parabolic current control for single-phase stand-alone inverters","volume":"31","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15677455","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177091/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sensorless implementation of the parabolic current control for single-phase stand-alone inverters","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2464292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070364S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7177091","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7177093,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Hu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7235010/7177093/hu-2464703-small.gif","p":["Jianwei Hu (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communications and information system with the College of Communications Engineering.

To thoroughly assess the secrecy performance achieved by the proposed scheme, we derive new closed-form expressions for the exact secrecy outage probability and the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity for arbitrary SNRs. We also derive new compact expressions for the asymptotic secrecy outage probability at high SNRs. Notably, in the analysis, we take spatial correlation at the receiver into consideration.

To determine the set of sensors with the most informative data, we develop a probabilistic sensor management scheme based on the concepts developed in compressive sensing. In the proposed scheme where each sensor transmits its observation with a certain probability via a coherent multiple access channel (MAC), the observation vector received at the fusion center becomes a compressed version of the original observations. In this framework, the sensor management problem can be cast as the problem of finding the probability of transmission at each node so that a given performance metric is optimized. Our goal is to determine the optimal values of the probabilities of transmission so that the trace of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) is maximized at any given time instant with a constraint on the available energy. We consider two cases, where the fusion center has i) complete information and ii) only partial information, regarding the sensor transmissions. The expression for FIM is derived for both cases and the optimal values of the probabilities of transmission are found accordingly. With nonidentical probabilities, we obtain the results numerically while under the assumption that each sensor transmits with equal probability, we obtain the optimal values analytically. We provide numerical results to illustrate the performance of the proposed probabilistic sensor management scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2464197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7293100/07177096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2464197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7293100","startPage":"6049","endPage":"6060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sensing Based Probabilistic Sensor Management for Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177096","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7293100/7177096-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing Based Probabilistic Sensor Management for Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"22","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15519695","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177096/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1307775"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Compressive Sensing Based Probabilistic Sensor Management for Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-cao-2464197-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156216S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7293100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7293100","articleId":"7177096","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177100,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Ali Mohammadpour","affiliation":["NRG Renew, Scottsdale, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/7389461/7177100/7177100-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Ali Mohammadpour (S'09\u2013M'15) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering power systems from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering with a focus on renewable energy systems from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA, in 2014.","He continued at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA, where he was a Postdoctoral Fellow until March 2015.

The former is a commercially available series FACTS device, and the latter is the second generation of series FACTS devices using gate turnoff (GTO) or other gate-commuted switches. The GCSC is characterized by a fixed capacitor in parallel with a pair of antiparallel gate-commuted switches enabling rapid control of series impedance of a transmission line. It is shown that the SSR damping with a GCSC is limited to changing the resonance frequency, in comparison with a fixed capacitor, which may not be adequate to damp out the SSR. Therefore, a supplementary SSR damping controller (SSRDC) is designed for the GCSC. Moreover, it is proven that the GCSC equipped with a well-designed SSRDC can effectively damp the SSR in FSWTGS. In order to verify the effectiveness of the GCSC in SSR damping, its performance is compared with the TCSC, which is an existing series FACTS device. In addition, time-frequency analysis (TFA) is employed in order to evaluate and compare the SSR time-varying frequency characteristics of the GCSC and TCSC. The IEEE first benchmark model on SSR is adapted with an integrated FSWTGS to perform studies, and extensive simulations are carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the result.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7389461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2464323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7389461/07177100.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"86","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2464323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSR Damping in Fixed-Speed Wind Farms Using Series FACTS Controllers","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/61/7389461/7177100-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"SSR Damping in Fixed-Speed Wind Farms Using Series FACTS Controllers","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7177100/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15722262","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"I/UCRC GRAPES"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"SSR Damping in Fixed-Speed Wind Farms Using Series FACTS Controllers","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-shin-2464323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073144S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7389461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7389461","articleId":"7177100","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7177102,"authors":[{"name":"Tomislav Dragi\u010devi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7177102/dragi-small.gif","p":["Tomislav Dragi\u010devi\u0107 (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913)\n received the M.E.E. and the industrial Ph.D. degrees from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Zagreb, Croatia, in\n 2009 and 2013, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg University,\n Aalborg, Denmark.

The advantages of dc distribution when compared to its ac counterpart are well known. The most important ones include higher reliability and efficiency, simpler control and natural interface with renewable energy sources, and electronic loads and energy storage systems. With rapid emergence of these components in modern power systems, the importance of dc in today's society is gradually being brought to a whole new level. A broad class of traditional dc distribution applications, such as traction, telecom, vehicular, and distributed power systems can be classified under dc MG framework and ongoing development, and expansion of the field is largely influenced by concepts used over there. This paper aims first to shed light on the practical design aspects of dc MG technology concerning typical power hardware topologies and their suitability for different emerging smart grid applications. Then, an overview of the state of the art in dc MG protection and grounding is provided. Owing to the fact that there is no zero-current crossing, an arc that appears upon breaking dc current cannot be extinguished naturally, making the protection of dc MGs a challenging problem. In relation with this, a comprehensive overview of protection schemes, which discusses both design of practical protective devices and their integration into overall protection systems, is provided. Closely coupled with protection, conflicting grounding objectives, e.g., minimization of stray current and common-mode voltage, are explained and several practical solutions are presented. Also, standardization efforts for dc systems are addressed. Finally, concluding remarks and important future research directions are pointed out.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","volume":"31","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15677474","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7177102/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DC Microgrids\u2014Part II: A Review of Power Architectures, Applications, and Standardization Issues","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006130","fundingName":"Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC Microgrids\u2014Part II: A Review of Power Architectures, Applications, and Standardization Issues","sourcePdf":"tpel-dragicevic-2464277-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.357377S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"559","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7177102","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7177105,"authors":[{"name":"Junyi Shen","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Energy Harvesting, and Renewable Energies Laboratory (PEHREL), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687316/7299736/7177105/jshen-2464690-small.gif","p":["Junyi Shen received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2011.

This paper presents the design of a supervisory energy management strategy that optimally addresses this issue. In this work, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated to optimize the power split in order to prolong the battery lifetime and to reduce the HESS power losses. In this HESS energy management problem, a detailed dc-dc converter model is considered to include both the conduction losses and the switching losses. The optimization problem is numerically solved for various drive cycle data sets using dynamic programming (DP). Trained using the DP results, an effective and intelligent online implementation of the optimal power split is realized based on neural networks (NNs). The proposed online intelligent energy management controller is applied to a midsize electric vehicles (EV). A rule-based control strategy is also implemented in this work for comparison with the proposed energy management strategy. The proposed online energy management controller effectively splits the load demand and achieves excellent result of the energy efficiency. It is also estimated that the proposed online energy management controller can extend the battery life by over 60%, which greatly outperforms the rule-based control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TTE.2015.2464690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687316/7299736/07177105.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTE.2015.2464690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Supervisory Energy Management Control Strategy in a Battery/Ultracapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177105","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6687316/7299736/7177105-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Supervisory Energy Management Control Strategy in a Battery/Ultracapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177105/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15539887","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177105/","volume":"1","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1307228"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Supervisory Energy Management Control Strategy in a Battery/Ultracapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System","sourcePdf":"tte-khaligh-2464690-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100956S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687316","isNumber":"7299736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687316","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"7299736","articleId":"7177105","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7177114,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyan Huang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7177114/huang-2464278-small.gif","p":["\n\nXiaoyan Huang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the \nUniversity of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2004, 2007, and 2012, respectively.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of \nElectronic Science and Technology of China.

To fully reap these benefits, this paper focuses on joint optimization of user grouping, virtual base station (VBS) clustering, and transmit beamforming in C-RAN downlink networks for maximizing the system utility, subject to the diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of users and the power constraints of distributed remote radio heads (RRHs). To tackle the high computational complexity in solving the nonconvex combinatorial optimization problem, a two-stage solution is proposed. Specifically, a dynamic user-centric scheduling algorithm is developed to form user groups and cluster RRHs into VBSs by exploiting the nonuniform distribution of users. Then, an iterative transmit beamformer optimization algorithm is devised to coordinate the transmit beamforming among the VBSs to mitigate the intracell and intercell interference, hence further enhancing the overall system utility. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance gain over various reference algorithms in terms of system utility, system throughput, and energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2464278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07177114.pdf","startPage":"5449","endPage":"5460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2464278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Scheduling and Beamforming Coordination in Cloud Radio Access Networks With QoS Guarantees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177114","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/7513343/7177114-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177114/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Scheduling and Beamforming Coordination in Cloud Radio Access Networks With QoS Guarantees","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141230","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177114/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1217611, 1421685 and 1457262"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Joint Scheduling and Beamforming Coordination in Cloud Radio Access Networks With QoS Guarantees","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2464278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104391S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7177114","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7177117,"authors":[{"name":"Mulugeta K.

This paper is devoted to the error rate analysis and energy efficiency optimization of regenerative cooperative networks in the presence of multipath fading under spatial correlation. To this end, exact and asymptotic analytic expressions are first derived for the symbol error rate (SER) of M-ary quadrature amplitude and M-ary phase-shift keying modulations (M-QAM and M-PSK), respectively, assuming a dual-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relay system, spatially correlated Nakagami-m multipath fading, and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the destination. The derived expressions are subsequently employed in quantifying the energy consumption of the considered system, incorporating both transmit energy and the energy consumed by the transceiver circuits, and in deriving the optimal power allocation (OPA) formulation for minimizing energy consumption under certain quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. A relatively harsh path-loss (PL) model, which also accounts for realistic device-to-device communications, is adopted in numerical evaluations, and various useful insights are provided for the design of future low-energy wireless networks deployments. Indicatively, it is shown that, depending on the degree of spatial correlation, severity of fading, transmission distance, relay location, and power allocation strategy, target performance can be achieved with much overall energy reduction compared with direct transmission (DT) reference.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2464211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07177117.pdf","startPage":"4973","endPage":"4992","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2464211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact Error Analysis and Energy Efficiency Optimization of Regenerative Relay Systems Under Spatial Correlation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"Exact Error Analysis and Energy Efficiency Optimization of Regenerative Relay Systems Under Spatial Correlation","volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7177117/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141166","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes)"},{"fundingName":"\u201cEnergy-Efficient Wireless Networks and Connectivity of Devices-Systems (EWINE-S)\u201d"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"251138"},{"fundingName":"Digitally-Enhanced RF for Cognitive Radio Devices","grantNumber":"284694"},{"fundingName":"Fundamentals of Ultra Dense 5G Networks with Application to Machine Type Communication"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471058"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact Error Analysis and Energy Efficiency Optimization of Regenerative Relay Systems Under Spatial Correlation","sourcePdf":"tvt-sofotasios-2464211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13372S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7177117","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7177119,"authors":[{"name":"Shuilin Tian","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7352399/7177119/tian-small.gif","p":["Shuilin Tian (S'11) received the B.S. degree in electrical\n engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in power electronics from the\n Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA, in April 2012, where he is currently working\n toward the Ph.D. degree.","From May 2012 to August 2012, he was an Application Engineer Intern in Linear Technology, Milpitas, CA, USA.

However, no simple equivalent circuit model is available yet for resonant-type dc-dc converters. Up to now, the most successful equivalent circuit model of series resonant converter (SRC) is based on extended describing function concept, which was proposed by Yang et al. However, the equivalent circuit is a complicated fifth order with the cross-coupling effect and no analytical solution is provided for transfer functions. This paper proposes a simple third-order equivalent circuit model of SRC. The equivalent circuit model is derived by simplification of the original fifth-order equivalent circuit, based on the fact that the resonant capacitor behaves like an equivalent resonant inductor with respect to the modulation frequency. The equivalent circuit model can predict the dynamic behavior very well when the switching frequency is below, close to, or above the resonant frequency. Furthermore, for the first time, analytical expressions of all transfer functions, i.e., control-to-output, input-to-output, output impedance, and input impedance are provided. These analytical transfer functions will serve as a useful tool for the feedback design. The equivalent circuit model is verified by Simplis simulation and experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177119/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15677452","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified Equivalent Circuit Model of Series Resonant Converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified Equivalent Circuit Model of Series Resonant Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-tian-2464351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121593S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7352399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7352399","articleId":"7177119","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7177120,"authors":[{"name":"Haoyong Yu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/7274528/7177120/haoyo-small.gif","p":["Haoyong Yu (M\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in\n mechanical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1988 and 1991, respectively, and the\n Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2002.","He was with DSO National Laboratories of Singapore as a Principal Member of Technical Staff before he joined the\n faculty of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, in September\n 2010.

Physical interaction affects the controlled variables and may even cause system instability. Thus, human-robot interaction control design is critical in rehabilitation robotics research. This paper presents an interaction control strategy for a gait rehabilitation robot. The robot is driven by a novel compact series elastic actuator, which provides intrinsic compliance and backdrivablility for safe human-robot interaction. The control design is based on the actuator model with consideration of interaction dynamics. It consists mainly of human interaction compensation, friction compensation, and is enhanced with a disturbance observer. Such a control scheme enables the robot to achieve low output impedance when operating in human-in-charge mode and achieve accurate force tracking when operating in force control mode. Due to the direct physical interaction with humans, the controller design must also meet the stability requirement. A theoretical proof is provided to show the guaranteed stability of the closed-loop system under the proposed controller. The proposed design is verified with an ankle robot in walking experiments. The results can be readily extended to other rehabilitation and assistive robots driven with compliant actuators without much difficulty.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Actuators","Force","Friction","Observers","Impedance","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","force control","human-robot interaction","medical robotics","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system instability","human-robot interaction control design","gait rehabilitation robot","compact series elastic actuator","interaction dynamics","friction compensation","human interaction compensation","disturbance observer","low output impedance","human-in-charge mode","force tracking","force control mode","closed-loop system","assistive robots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Force control","observer","physical human\u2013robot interaction","rehabilitation robotics","series elastic actuator (SEA)"]},{"kwd":["Force control","observer","physical human\u2013robot interaction","rehabilitation robotics","series elastic actuator (SEA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177120","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2015.2457314","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/7274528/07177120.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2015.2457314","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human\u2013Robot Interaction Control of Rehabilitation Robots With Series Elastic Actuators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Human\u2013Robot Interaction Control of Rehabilitation Robots With Series Elastic Actuators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177120/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","volume":"31","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7177120/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15484810","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EDIC Seed Fund of the National University of Singapore","grantNumber":"R-261-503-002-133"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001348","fundingName":"Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore","grantNumber":"1421480015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human\u2013Robot Interaction Control of Rehabilitation Robots With Series Elastic Actuators","sourcePdf":"tro-yu-2457314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079446S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7274528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"7274528","articleId":"7177120","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7177124,"authors":[{"name":"Boyu Li","affiliation":["RF DSP Inc., Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7349281/7177124/li-2464299-small.gif","p":["\n\nBoyu Li (S'10\u2013M'13) received the B.S. degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree as well as the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Irvine, CA, USA, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

The cooperation of next-generation techniques could offer more benefits, e.g., SC in-band wireless backhaul in massive MIMO systems. In this paper, three strategies of SC in-band wireless backhaul in massive MIMO systems are introduced and compared, i.e., complete time-division duplex (CTDD), zero-division duplex (ZDD), and ZDD with interference rejection (ZDD-IR). Simulation results demonstrate that SC in-band wireless backhaul has the potential to improve the throughput for massive MIMO systems. Specifically, among the three strategies, CTDD is the simplest one and could achieve decent throughput improvement. Depending on conditions, with the self-interference cancellation capability at SCs, ZDD could achieve better throughput than CTDD, even with residual self-interference. Moreover, ZDD-IR requires the additional interference rejection process at the BS compared to ZDD, but it could generally achieve better throughput than CTDD and ZDD.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"14","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15676935","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177124/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Small Cell In-Band Wireless Backhaul in Massive MIMO Systems: A Cooperation of Next-Generation Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small Cell In-Band Wireless Backhaul in Massive MIMO Systems: A Cooperation of Next-Generation Techniques","sourcePdf":"twc-li-2464299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102203S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7177124","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7177127,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Tang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7177127/tang-2464683-small.gif","p":["\n\nJie Tang (S'10\u2013M'13) received the B.Eng. degree in information \nengineering from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2008; the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) \nin communication systems and signal processing from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., in 2009; and the Ph.D. \ndegree from Loughborough University, Leicestershire, U.K., in 2012.","Since 2013, he has been a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, \nThe University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K. His research interests include optimization techniques and analysis of \nwireless communication networks, with particular focus on green communications, fifth-generation systems, heterogeneous \nnetworks, cognitive radio, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and cooperative MIMO schemes."]},"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085384969"},{"name":"Daniel K.

However, with this power model, the EE-SE tradeoff optimization problem, which jointly optimizes the transmit covariance matrices while determining the optimal admitted user set and the active transmit antenna set, is nonconvex, and hence, it is extremely difficult to solve directly. As a result, we propose an algorithm that decouples the multicarrier EE optimization problem to a set of single-carrier EE optimization problems. For the single-carrier EE optimization problem, we first investigate the EE-SE tradeoff problem with a fixed admitted user set and transmit antenna set. Under this setup, we prove that the EE-SE relationship is a quasiconcave function. Furthermore, EE is proved to be either strictly decreasing with SE or first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing with SE. Based on these findings, we propose a two-layer resource allocation algorithm to tackle the comprehensive EE-SE tradeoff problem. Meanwhile, since admitting more users and activating more transmit antennas can achieve a higher sum rate at the cost of larger transmit-independent power consumption, there exists a tradeoff between sum-rate gain and power consumption. We therefore study the user and antenna selection approach to further explore the optimal tradeoff. Both the optimal exhaustive search and the Frobenius-norm-based dynamic selection schemes are developed to further improve the achievable EE. To further reduce the computational complexity, a strategy that chooses a fixed admitted user set for all the subcarriers is developed. Simulation results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation algorithm can efficiently approach the optimal EE-SE tradeoff.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2464683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07177127.pdf","startPage":"5185","endPage":"5199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2464683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Energy Efficiency\u2013Spectral Efficiency Tradeoff in MIMO-OFDMA Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"On the Energy Efficiency\u2013Spectral Efficiency Tradeoff in MIMO-OFDMA Broadcast Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177127/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16141209","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177127/","volume":"65","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/J021768/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Energy Efficiency\u2013Spectral Efficiency Tradeoff in MIMO-OFDMA Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-tang-2464683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100634S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7177127","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7177128,"authors":[{"name":"Qiong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Qiong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085463022"},{"name":"Yuanqing Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Li","id":"37085473404"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"37310786000"},{"name":"Anlin He","affiliation":["China Institute of Atomic Energy, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Anlin","lastName":"He","id":"37085534180"},{"name":"Gang Guo","affiliation":["China Institute of Atomic Energy, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37077656500"},{"name":"Sang H.

This test chip was fabricated in a 65 nm bulk technology and irradiated by heavy ions at different supply voltages. Experimental results show that the SERs of 6T and 10T cells present significant sensitivities to supply voltages when the particle linear energy transfers (LETs) are relatively low. For Quatro and DICE cells, one does not consistently show superior hardening performance over the other. It is also noted that Quatro cells show significant advantage in single event resilience over 10T cells although they consume similar areas.

Notable parameter variations are experienced along the base station array, such as the average received energy at each antenna, and the directions of arrival of signals impinging on different parts of the array. In this paper, a new channel model is proposed to describe this spatial non-stationarity in massive MIMO channels by incorporating the concepts of partially visible clusters and wholly visible clusters. Furthermore, a closed-form expression of an upper bound on the ergodic sum capacity is derived for the new model, and the influence of the spatial non-stationarity on the sum capacity is analyzed. Analysis shows that for non-identically-and-independent-distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels, the non-stationarity benefits the sum capacity by bringing a more even spread of channel eigenvalues. Specifically, more partially visible clusters, smaller cluster visibility regions, and a larger antenna array can all help to yield a well-conditioned channel, and benefit the sum capacity. This shows the advantage of using a large antenna array in a non-i.i.d. channel: the sum capacity benefits not only from a higher array gain, but also from a more spatially non-stationary channel. Numerical results demonstrate our analysis and the tightness of the upper bound.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7349281/07177130.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2464219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2464219","startPage":"7044","endPage":"7056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis for Spatially Non-Wide Sense Stationary Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177130/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis for Spatially Non-Wide Sense Stationary Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177130/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"15676967","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program","grantNumber":"2012CB316000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201192"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"SS2014AA012107"},{"fundingName":"National S&T Major Project","grantNumber":"2014ZX03003003-002"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua-Qualcomm Joint Research Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis for Spatially Non-Wide Sense Stationary Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-li-2464219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092276S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7349281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7349281","articleId":"7177130","onlineDate":"04 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177131,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshinori Kusuda","affiliation":["Analog Devices Linear and Precision Technology Group, USA, San Jose, CA, U.S.A."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7177131/7177131-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yoshinori Kusuda (M\u201911) received the M.S.E.E. degree from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2004.","He joined Analog Devices Japan Design Center in 2004, and is currently based in San Jose, CA, USA, working for the Linear and Precision Technology Group.

Up-modulated chopper ripple is suppressed by auto- zeroing. Furthermore, glitches from the charge injection of the input switches are mitigated by employing six parallel input stages with 800 kHz interleaved clocks. This moves the majority of the glitch energy up to 4.8 MHz, while leaving little energy at 800 kHz. As a result, the requirements on an external low-pass glitch filter is relaxed, and a wider usable signal bandwidth can be obtained.

These induce undesired interaction forces that may jeopardize safe operation. Uncompensated inertia of the robotic links also generates spurious interaction forces. Current design approaches to compensate for misalignments rely on the use of auxiliary passive degrees of freedom that unavoidably increase robot inertia, which potentially affects their effectiveness in reducing undesired interaction forces. Assessing the relative impact of misalignment and robot inertia on the wearer can, therefore, provide useful insights on how to improve the effectiveness of such approaches, especially in those situations where the dynamics of the movement are quasi-periodic and, therefore, predictable such as in gait. In this paper, we studied the effects of knee joint misalignments on the wearer's gait, by using a treadmill-based exoskeleton developed by our group, the ALEX II. Knee joint misalignments were purposely introduced by adjusting the mismatch between the length of the robot thigh and that of the human thigh. The amount of robot inertia reflected to the user was adjusted through control. Results evidenced that knee misalignment significantly changes human-robot interaction forces, especially at the thigh interface, and this effect can be attenuated by actively compensating for robot inertia. Misalignments caused by an excessively long robot thigh are less critical than misalignments of equal magnitude deriving from an excessively short robot thigh.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/7177171/07177145.pdf","startPage":"978","endPage":"987","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2015.2450414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2015.2450414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knee Joint Misalignment in Exoskeletons for the Lower Extremities: Effects on User's Gait","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Knee","Legged locomotion","Thigh","Exoskeletons","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","gait analysis","human-robot interaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knee joint misalignment","lower extremities","user gait effect","human musculoskeletal system","intra-intersubjects variability","human-robot misalignments","robotic link uncompensated inertia","spurious interaction forces","auxiliary passive degrees of freedom","treadmill-based exoskeleton","human-robot interaction forces"]},{"kwd":["Active leg exoskeleton (ALEX II)","force control","human\u2013robot misalignment","rehabilitation robotics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Knee Joint Misalignment in Exoskeletons for the Lower Extremities: Effects on User's Gait","volume":"31","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7177145/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15365249","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knee Joint Misalignment in Exoskeletons for the Lower Extremities: Effects on User's Gait","sourcePdf":"tro-agrawal-2450414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085118S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7177171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7177171","articleId":"7177145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7177146,"authors":[{"name":"Rafik Mebarki","affiliation":["PRISMA Laboratory, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e Tecnologie dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/7177171/7177146/mebar-small.gif","p":["Rafik Mebarki was born in Algiers, Algeria, on April 1983.

The translational velocity of the vehicle is estimated online with a nonlinear observer, which exploits spherical visual features as the main source of information. With the proposed solution, only four visual features have shown to be enough for the observer to operate in a real scenario. In addition, the observer is computationally light with constant numerical complexity, involving small-dimension matrices. The observer output is then exploited in a nonlinear controller designed with an integral backstepping approach, thus yielding a novel robust control system. By means of Lyapunov analysis, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. Extensive simulation and experimental tests with a quadrotor are carried out to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed approach. The control system runs fully onboard on a standard processor, and only a low-cost sensing suite is employed. Tracking of a target whose speed exceeds 2 $\\mathrm{m/s}$ is also considered in the real-hardware experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2015.2451371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/7177171/07177146.pdf","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2015.2451371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Visual Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in GPS-Denied Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177146/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Visual Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in GPS-Denied Environments","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15365253","htmlLink":"/document/7177146/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ARCAS collaborative"},{"fundingName":"European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013)","grantNumber":"ICT-287617"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Visual Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in GPS-Denied Environments","sourcePdf":"tro-mebarki-2451371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089281S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7177171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7177171","articleId":"7177146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177185,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaqi Ning","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaqi","lastName":"Ning","id":"37085396266"},{"name":"Zhaohua Lu","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085393250"},{"name":"Tian Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085386318"},{"name":"Jinguo Quan","affiliation":["Division of Information Science & Technology, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jinguo","lastName":"Quan","id":"37085434331"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177185","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"abstract":"For massive MIMO systems, linear signal detectors, such as zero forcing (ZF) signal detector, can achieve the near-optimal performance, but usually involve high complexity due to the required matrix inversion of large size. In this paper, we propose a signal detector based on symmetric successive over-relaxation (SSOR) method without matrix inversion, which can reduce the complexity by one order of magnitude. To guarantee the performance of SSOR-based signal detector in practice, we also propose a simple quantified relaxation parameter for SSOR-based signal detector, which only depends on the MIMO system configuration. Analysis verifies that the proposed SSOR-based signal detector can reduce the complexity of ZF signal detector by about one order of magnitude. Meanwhile, simulation results show that SSOR-based signal detector can achieve the near-optimal performance of ZF signal detector with only a small number of iterations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177185.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity signal detector based on SSOR method for massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","Complexity theory","Simulation","Bit error rate","Antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO systems","low complexity signal detector","symmetric successive over-relaxation method","SSOR method","linear signal detectors","zero forcing signal detector","simple quantified relaxation parameter","iteration method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5.3 Signal processing for transmission","6.0 Making better use of the spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity signal detector based on SSOR method for massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177185/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347009","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity signal detector based on SSOR method for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM015034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057893S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177186,"authors":[{"name":"Bichai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bichai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085538059"},{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team, Coordination Center (CNCERT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085576434"},{"name":"Zhaohua Lu","affiliation":["ZTE Cooperation, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085393250"},{"name":"Tian Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085386318"},{"name":"Jinguo Quan","affiliation":["Division of Information Science & Technology, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jinguo","lastName":"Quan","id":"37085434331"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177186","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":85,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4557},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Interference","Silicon carbide","Signal to noise ratio","5G mobile communication","Uplink","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Internet","Internet of Things","mobile communication","multi-access systems","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non-orthogonal multiple access schemes","5G","mobile Internet","Internet of things","IoT","5th generation wireless communications","mobile traffic","power-domain NOMA","low-density spreading","sparse code multiple access","multiuser shared access","pattern division multiple access","receiver complexity","SCMA","MUSA","PDMA","bit error rate","BER","Rayleigh fading channels","codebook optimization"]}],"abstract":"With the development of mobile Internet and Internet of things (IoT), the 5th generation (5G) wireless communications will foresee explosive increase in mobile traffic. To address challenges in 5G such as higher spectral efficiency, massive connectivity, and lower latency, some non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have been recently actively investigated, including power-domain NOMA, multiple access with low-density spreading (LDS), sparse code multiple access (SCMA), multiuser shared access (MUSA), pattern division multiple access (PDMA), etc. Different from conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes, NOMA can realize overloading by introducing some controllable interferences at the cost of slightly increased receiver complexity, which can achieve significant gains in spectral efficiency and accommodate much more users. In this paper, we will discuss basic principles and key features of three typical NOMA schemes, i.e., SCMA, MUSA, and PDMA. What's more, their performance in terms of uplink bit error rate (BER) will be compared. Simulation results show that in typical Rayleigh fading channels, SCMA has the best performance, while the BER performance of MUSA and PDMA are very close to each other. In addition, we also analyze the performance of PDMA using the same factor graph as SCMA, which indicates that the performance gain of SCMA over PDMA comes from both the difference of factor graph and the codebook optimization.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177186","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177186.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison study of non-orthogonal multiple access schemes for 5G","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison study of non-orthogonal multiple access schemes for 5G","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177186/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177186/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison study of non-orthogonal multiple access schemes for 5G","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM015090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070388S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177197,"authors":[{"name":"Stanislaw Gorlow","affiliation":["UMR 5800, CNRS, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Stanislaw","lastName":"Gorlow","id":"38230310300"},{"name":"Zsolt Koll\u00e1r","affiliation":["Dept. of Broadband Infocommunication and Electromagnetic Theory, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zsolt","lastName":"Koll\u00e1r","id":"37085584307"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177197","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Gain","Dynamic range","Modulation","Distortion","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","distortion","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","PAPR reduction","dynamic range compression","decompressor","compressed audio signals","signal distortion"]}],"abstract":"We present a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction method for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) or similar modulation schemes based on dynamic range compression and decompression.

In this paper, hybrid constellation mapping is proposed to improve performance of coding and modulation with punctured-node LDPC. General bit interleaving is performed over original puncture-node LDPC to obtain hybrid constellation mapping. By applying non-uniform constellation design methodology, the specific constellation is designed, under which the average mutual information (AMI) is approaching the capacity. Compared with punctured-node LDPC with BPSK modulation, hybrid constellation mapping can provide more than 0.2 dB gain in i.i.d Rayleigh channel according to simulation. Moreover, fewer number of iterations is needed in decoding algorithm of hybrid constellation mapping for punctured-node LDPC, which can reduce decoding complexity and power consumption at high SNR.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177200","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177200.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid constellation mapping for punctured-node LDPC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid constellation mapping for punctured-node LDPC","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177200/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid constellation mapping for punctured-node LDPC","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058034S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7177201,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Shin Han","affiliation":["Digital Transmission Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Shin","lastName":"Han","id":"38548815800"},{"name":"Jeong-Min Choi","affiliation":["Digital Transmission Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Min","lastName":"Choi","id":"37715994200"},{"name":"Sungho Jeon","affiliation":["Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), Technical Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37292893500"},{"name":"Robin Shrestha","affiliation":["Digital Transmission Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Shrestha","id":"37085386345"},{"name":"Jong-Soo Seo","affiliation":["Digital Transmission Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Soo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292426500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177201","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a cooperative communication system with multiple full duplex relays deployed in the amplify-and-forward mode over frequency selective channels.

The structure of the ATSC 3.0 BICM consists of a forward error correcting (FEC) code, bit interleaver and constellation mapper. In order to achieve high efficiency over a wide range of reception conditions and Carrier-to-Noise (C/N) ratio values, several notable new elements have been standardized. First, twenty four original Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes have been designed, with coding rates from 2/15 (0.13) up to 13/15 (0.87) for two code sizes: 16200 bits and 64800 bits. Two different LDPC structures have been adopted; one structure more suited to medium and high coding rates and another structure suited to very low coding rates. Second, in addition to QPSK, Non-Uniform Constellations (NUCs) have been chosen for constellation sizes from 16QAM to 4096QAM to bridge the gap to the Shannon theoretical limit. Two different types of NUCs have been proposed: one-dimensional NUCs (1D-NUC) for 1024- and 4096-point constellations, and two-dimensional NUCs (2D-NUCs) for 16-, 64- and 256-point constellations. 2D-NUCs achieve a better performance than 1D-NUCs but with a higher complexity since they cannot be separated into two independent I/Q components. Each NUC has been optimized for the particular code and coding rate, although for the shorter code length the constellations have been limited up to 256QAM. Finally, a bit interleaver, optimized for each NUC/coding rate combination, has been designed to maximize the performance. This paper describes the coding, modulation and bit interleaving modules of the BICM block of ATSC 3.0, and compares its performance with other DTT standards such as ATSC A/53 and DVB-T2.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177209","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177209.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation and coding for ATSC 3.0","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modulation and coding for ATSC 3.0","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177209/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347017","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177209/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation and coding for ATSC 3.0","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045025S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177211,"authors":[{"name":"Yijin Zhao","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yijin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085380064"},{"name":"Yin Xu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37596325800"},{"name":"Kang Zhao","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085390156"},{"name":"Dazhi He","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Dazhi","lastName":"He","id":"37287868400"},{"name":"Wenjun Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278428800"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Beijing University, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"38185564300"},{"name":"Jingfei Cui","affiliation":["SARFT, Academy of Broadcasting Science, China"],"firstName":"Jingfei","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085381617"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177211","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177211","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Random access memory","Iterative decoding","Throughput","Standards","IEEE 802.16 Standard"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high throughput LDPC code","decoder design","HINOC 2.0 systems","low density parity check code","optimal parallel decoder architecture","FPGA Stratix V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low density parity check (LDPC) codes","Channel coding","Future technologies and services of broadcasting","High performance network over coax (HINOC)","Parallel high throughput LDPC decoder"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a high-throughput structured low density parity check (LDPC) code and an optimal parallel decoder architecture with advanced Ping-Pong RAMs for the HINOC 2.0 systems.

VLC offers advantageous properties such as safety, environmental protection, worldwide availability and high capacity. It can be used as an effective supplement of the existing wireless communication. Power line communication (PLC) using the omnipresent power line cables in driving LED also can be used as a communication medium between the LEDs and other network. It only requires little modification of the existing infrastructure to achieve the purpose of illumination and communication simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an efficient and low-cost indoor broadband broadcasting system based on the integration of PLC and VLC. The proposed system take full advantages of existing cabling infrastructure, providing high-speed communications while achieving better signal coverage. The performance is evaluated and analyzed with a three-LED lamp network based on the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177216","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177216.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The video transmission platform for The PLC and VLC integrated system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177216/","displayDocTitle":"The video transmission platform for The PLC and VLC integrated system","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177216/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The video transmission platform for The PLC and VLC integrated system","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090021S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177217,"authors":[{"name":"Sungho Jeon","affiliation":["Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), Technical Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37292893500"},{"name":"Junghyun Kim","affiliation":["Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), Technical Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Junghyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"38259389500"},{"name":"Jae-Shin Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Shin","lastName":"Han","id":"38548815800"},{"name":"Sang-Hun Kim","affiliation":["Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), Technical Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Hun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37309969600"},{"name":"Jeong-Deok Kim","affiliation":["Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), Technical Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Deok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085564150"},{"name":"Jong-Soo Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Soo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292426500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177217","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"abstract":"In this study, a step-by-step analysis on the net Gross single-input single-output single frequency network gain (SISO-SFNG) is presented. The net gain is calculated by subtracting the net gain of a MISO-SFN from that of a multiple-input singleoutput (MISO)-SFN. In order to predict the service coverage of SFN accurately, it is required to calculate the corresponding SFN gain accurately in the receive signal overlapping area of the SFN. Analytical formulas are derived to calculate the net gains of SISO-SFN and MISO-SFN as a function of the signal amplitude and delay spread at each receive point of SFN. Validity of the derived formulas is confirmed by comparing the numerical analysis results with the measurement data in the related studies. Finally, we exemplify a practical application of the derived formula to predict the net gain of MISO-SFN system by using the reference network with a reference planning configuration.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Delays","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Digital video broadcasting","Modulation","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","MISO-SFNG","DVB-T2 system","step-by-step analysis on","single-input single-output single frequency network gain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177217","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177217","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177217","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical analysis on the net Gross MISO-SFNG in DVB-T2 system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical analysis on the net Gross MISO-SFNG in DVB-T2 system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177217/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177217/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347028","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical analysis on the net Gross MISO-SFNG in DVB-T2 system","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070714S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7177218,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In the traditional GSM scheme, the symbols transmitted by different active antenna elements are the same during each symbol period and the number of states of each antenna element is only two i.e. on and off. The two-state constraint over the antenna in GSM is however found by the authors of this paper to generate constellation points that are nonuniformly spaced in the multi-dimensional signal space, which limits the spectral efficiency and deteriorates the reliability of GSM. In order to combat such limitation, a novel extension of GSM, which is termed as multiple antenna state spatial modulation (MAS-SM), is proposed. In the proposed MAS-SM scheme, the number of states of each antenna element is three i.e. positive on, negative on and off, which allows the positive and negative signs of the symbols transmitted by different active antenna elements to be different from each other. We show that such design makes the distribution of the signal vectors in the signal space to be uniform and thus enhances the spectral efficiency and error performance of the traditional GSM scheme. An analytical derivation of the bit error rate (BER) of a MAS-SM receiver using maximum-likelihood (ML) detection is proposed. Furthermore, Monte-Carlo simulations are performed in this paper to validate the error performance of MAS-SM scheme and the theoretical analysis of BER.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel spectral efficient spatial modulation scheme","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177219","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel spectral efficient spatial modulation scheme","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177219/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15346993","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel spectral efficient spatial modulation scheme","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063687S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177220,"authors":[{"name":"Meisong Zhu","affiliation":["School of Elettronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.

It has now completely replaced analogue as the main delivery system for terrestrial television in the UK. A digital television broadcast system offers many improvements over analogue transmission. It allows the delivery of a greater number of TV channels into the home by multiplexing multiple channels onto the same transmission frequency. If the signal is successfully received and decoded, it can guarantee a set picture quality, as digital is more resilient to noise and interference than analogue. This can be exploited further by reducing the total broadcast power at the transmit towers, something that has already been achieved as part of the digital dividend. This research explores whether the broadcast power could be decreased further, or if more users could be covered using the same broadcast power, thus improving energy efficiency. If the broadcaster had access to accurate channel state information (CSI), then the entire broadcast system could be made more adaptive as beamforming techniques could be used to steer power to regions where coverage is needed. CSI would come via feedback from television equipment with channel monitoring devices supplying a relay network that operates over the internet. This paper explores the potential benefits of deploying beamforming in a broadcast Multiple Frequency Network (MFN).","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177221","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177221.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177221","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive broadcast beamforming techniques in a multiple frequency network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive broadcast beamforming techniques in a multiple frequency network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177221/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347062","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive broadcast beamforming techniques in a multiple frequency network","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057362S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7177222,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjing Tong","affiliation":["Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Tong","id":"37085535475"},{"name":"Li Song","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai, China","Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Song","id":"37399512900"},{"name":"Xiaokang Yang","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai, China","Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Xiaokang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37275557500"},{"name":"Hui Qu","affiliation":["Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Qu","id":"37085543680"},{"name":"Rong Xie","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai, China","Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37543843900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177222","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":689},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Feature extraction","Computed tomography","Mathematical model","Indexing","Accuracy","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","CNN","video annotation","video data","content-based video analysis","management technologies","video shot boundary detection","TRECVID 2001 test data","semantic labels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Retrieval and indexing","shot boundary detection","deep learning","convolutional neural networks","video coding and processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177222","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177222.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CNN-based shot boundary detection and video annotation","abstract":"With the explosive growth of video data, content-based video analysis and management technologies such as indexing, browsing and retrieval have drawn much attention.

In this paper, we propose a novel video shot boundary detection framework based on interpretable TAGs learned by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Firstly, we adopt a candidate segment selection to predict the positions of shot boundaries and discard most non-boundary frames. This preprocessing method can help to improve both accuracy and speed of the SBD algorithm. Then, cut transition and gradual transition detections which are based on the interpretable TAGs are conducted to identify the shot boundaries in the candidate segments. Afterwards, we synthesize the features of frames in a shot and get semantic labels for the shot. Experiments on TRECVID 2001 test data show that the proposed scheme can achieve a better performance compared with the state-of-the-art schemes. Besides, the semantic labels obtained by the framework can be used to depict the content of a shot.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347067","htmlLink":"/document/7177222/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CNN-based shot boundary detection and video annotation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN-based shot boundary detection and video annotation","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081352S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177224,"authors":[{"name":"Cristina Regueiro","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, SPAIN"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Regueiro","id":"37075713400"},{"name":"Jon Barrueco","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, SPAIN"],"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Barrueco","id":"37085433084"},{"name":"Jon Montalb\u00e1n","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, SPAIN"],"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Montalb\u00e1n","id":"37542867500"},{"name":"Unai Gil","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, SPAIN"],"firstName":"Unai","lastName":"Gil","id":"37294061600"},{"name":"Itziar Angulo","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, SPAIN"],"firstName":"Itziar","lastName":"Angulo","id":"37410958200"},{"name":"I\u00f1aki Eizmendi","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, SPAIN"],"firstName":"I\u00f1aki","lastName":"Eizmendi","id":"37391845000"},{"name":"Pablo Angueira","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, SPAIN"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Angueira","id":"37085394141"},{"name":"Manuel Velez","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, SPAIN"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Velez","id":"38324008800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177224","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177224","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High definition video","Signal to noise ratio","Bit rate","Video coding","Channel models","Digital video broadcasting","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high definition television","multiplexing","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HD-UHD TV indoor reception","scalable high efficiency video coding","SHVC technique","layer division multiplexing","LDM technique","HD-UHD TV services","TU6 channel model","PI channel model","IOA channel model","IOB channel model","signal to noise ratios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scalable Video Coding","SHVC","HEVC","Layer Division Multiplex","LDM","Terrestrial Broadcasting","Performance Evaluation","Laboratory tests","Indoor Reception"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a study that combines LDM (Layer Division Multiplexing) and SHVC (Scalable High Efficiency Video Coding) techniques to offer HD/UHD TV services in indoor scenarios.

The proposed search algorithm can be applied to MP algorithms which estimates the delay and the Doppler features of the channel in two dimensions efficiently. Two dimensional approach lowers the complexity significantly.

Compared to the conventional cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) or time-domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) which only relies on either frequency-domain pilots or time-domain pseudo noise (PN) sequence for channel estimation, the proposed TFT-OFDM uses PN sequence to obtain the channel sparsity level, and then the accurate channel impulse response (CIR) can be estimated by frequency-domain pilots. According to the compressive sensing (CS) theory, the pilot pattern has deterministic influence on the channel estimation perfromace. However, the pilot pattern has not been studied in the papers that proposed TFT-OFDM. In this paper, we introduce an optimal pilot pattern in TFT-OFDM. The method is based on minimizing the column correlation of matrices composed of rows of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) maxtrix. The indices of the chosen rows are determined by the pilot pattern. The optimal pilot pattern can be generated from the optimal cyclic difference set (CDS). When the optimal CDS does not exist, we introduce an iterative method based on greedy algorithm to obtain a suboptimal pilot pattern.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177227","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177227.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal pilot pattern for sparse channel estimation in TFT-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal pilot pattern for sparse channel estimation in TFT-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177227/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347006","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177227/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal pilot pattern for sparse channel estimation in TFT-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060678S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177229,"authors":[{"name":"In-Woong Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"In-Woong","lastName":"Kang","id":"38238521500"},{"name":"Ho Jae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Ho Jae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085530342"},{"name":"Youngmin Kim","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngmin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406972000"},{"name":"Jae Hyun Seo","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Hyun","lastName":"Seo","id":"37289631400"},{"name":"Heung Mook Kim","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Heung Mook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292766600"},{"name":"Hyoung-Nam Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Nam","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280366800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177229","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177229","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","Parity check codes","MIMO","Decoding","Modulation","Bit error rate","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","fading channels","high definition television","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO DVB-T2 system","bit mapper","UHDTV broadcasting","extrinsic information transfer-chart analysis","dual-polarized MIMO digital video broadcasting","MIMO fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit mapping","Bit-to-cell DEMUX","dual-polarized MIMO DVB-T2","EXIT-chart analysis","LDPC codes"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MIMO DVB-T2 system with a newly designed bit mapper for UHDTV broadcasting","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177229.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177229","abstract":"We propose a design methodology of a bit mapper based on the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT)-chart analysis for the dual-polarized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) digital video broadcasting-2nd generation terrestrial (DVB-T2) system.

By performing efficient noise filtering, DFT-based channel estimation (DFT-CE) method has been shown to be able to provide near-optimal performance with low complexity in a Typical Urban (TU) fading channel environment. On the other hand, in a Single-Frequency-Network (SFN) deployment, a receiver often faces the more challenging SFN channels, in which large delays are found between the signals received from different transmitters. This could significantly degrade the mobile performance of the future OFDM-based digital TV (DTV) system. In this paper, we propose a DFT-CE technique based on sub-window filtering (SubWin-DFT-CE).

However, those pilots occupy an important bandwidth which could have been allocated to data instead. Superimposed pilots have been proposed as substitutes to classical pilots and showed that with properly designed receivers, they are able to provide a satisfactory performance in terms of channel estimation and BER. Recently, a data nulling superimposed pilot (DNSP) scheme for OFDM has been proposed where interference from data on channel estimation is completely eliminated. This proposal motivated us to initiate a comprehensive comparison study between the classical superimposed pilot (CSP) scheme and the DNSP scheme. First, we address the channel estimation and bit error rate (BER) performance of the two schemes. We then provide a complexity comparison in terms of complex multiplications required by each scheme. Finally, insights about the channel capacity for each scheme are provided. Simulation results reveal that the CSP scheme has a faster convergence while the DNSP scheme has a better BER performance at the cost of higher complexity.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177258","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of superimposed pilot schemes in iterative receivers for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of superimposed pilot schemes in iterative receivers for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177258/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15347070","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177258/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of superimposed pilot schemes in iterative receivers for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097847S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177265,"authors":[{"name":"Yijun Shi","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center of Digital Television, China"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37076058700"},{"name":"Dazhi He","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Dazhi","lastName":"He","id":"37287868400"},{"name":"Genning Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Genning","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085495112"},{"name":"Yihang Huang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yihang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085496230"},{"name":"Miao Zhao","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37985195700"},{"name":"Yue Zhao","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085491828"},{"name":"Guangmin Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Guangmin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088718160"},{"name":"Yunfeng Guan","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Guan","id":"37290140800"},{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37935821200"},{"name":"Wenjun Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278428800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177265","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177265","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Binary phase shift keying","Standards","Rayleigh channels","Digital video broadcasting","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","iterative methods","parity check codes","power consumption","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["punctured-node LDPC","hybrid constellation mapping","general bit interleaving","nonuniform constellation","average mutual information","AMI","i.i.d Rayleigh channel","iteration method","decoding algorithm","decoding complexity","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid constellation","punctured-node LDPC","NUC","AMI"]}],"abstract":"Punctured-node LDPC can provide close-to-Shannon-limit waterfall performance and low error floor when carefully designed. In this paper, hybrid constellation mapping is proposed to improve performance of coding and modulation with punctured-node LDPC. General bit interleaving is performed over original puncture-node LDPC to obtain hybrid constellation mapping. By applying non-uniform constellation design methodology, the specific constellation is designed, under which the average mutual information (AMI) is approaching the capacity. Compared with punctured-node LDPC with BPSK modulation, hybrid constellation mapping can provide more than 0.2 dB gain in i.i.d Rayleigh channel according to simulation. Moreover, fewer number of iterations is needed in decoding algorithm of hybrid constellation mapping for punctured-node LDPC, which can reduce decoding complexity and power consumption at high SNR.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177265","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177265.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid constellation mapping for punctured-node LDPC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid constellation mapping for punctured-node LDPC","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177265/","accessionNumber":"15347014","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid constellation mapping for punctured-node LDPC","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043975S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7177268,"authors":[{"name":"Zhecheng An","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

The AACE is an estimator which is based on the averaging of the last N Scattered Pilots (SP) from the DVB-T2 model carried in the received OFDM symbols. The proposed method could in general be applied to any pilot based estimator. The noise introduced by the channel is considered as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with zero mean and thus an averaging process is used to eliminate it. The estimator adaptively follows the fluctuations of the amplitude envelope in the time domain and adapts the size of the buffer N, with respect to the coherence time (Tc). Finally, based on the averaged estimated channel, the LS or the LMMSE equalizer is applied to the received signal in the frequency domain. Simulations clearly show that the performance of the AACE-LS is superior to the conventional LS estimator and is near to the performance of the LMMSE with no need of a prior knowledge of the statistics and the noise of the channel and thus if the channel is unknown to the receiver, the AACE is a good choice.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177273.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of LS, LMMSE and Adaptive Averaging Channel Estimation (AACE) for DVB-T2","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of LS, LMMSE and Adaptive Averaging Channel Estimation (AACE) for DVB-T2","htmlLink":"/document/7177273/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15347063","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of LS, LMMSE and Adaptive Averaging Channel Estimation (AACE) for DVB-T2","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075023S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7177282,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Garro","affiliation":["iTEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Val\u00e8ncia, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Garro","id":"37085492553"},{"name":"Jordi Joan Gim\u00e9nez","affiliation":["iTEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Val\u00e8ncia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi Joan","lastName":"Gim\u00e9nez","id":"38351135500"},{"name":"David G\u00f3mez-Barquero","affiliation":["iTEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Val\u00e8ncia, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"G\u00f3mez-Barquero","id":"37297160500"},{"name":"Sung-Ik Park","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Ik","lastName":"Park","id":"37280893600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5865-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"7177282","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177282","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Mobile communication","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Broadcasting","Robustness","Time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","frequency division multiplexing","telecommunication standards","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","layer division multiplexing","time frequency slicing","advanced television system committee","U.S. digital terrestrial television standard","ATSC 3.0","frequency division multiplexing","FDM","time division multiplexing","TDM","radio frequency channels","RF channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Layer Division Multiplexing (LDM)","Time Frequency Slicing (TFS)","ATSC 3.0","mobile broadcasting"]}],"abstract":"The Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) is currently developing the next-generation U.S. Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) standard, known as ATSC 3.0. Two disruptive technologies for the physical layer are being evaluated, Layer Division Multiplexing (LDM) and Time Frequency Slicing (TFS). LDM consist in the transmission of a signal composed of two independent signals (layers) which are superimposed together at different power levels. These two layer can be configured with the desired robustness and capacity. LDM enables the efficient provision of services addressed to mobile and fixed reception in a more efficient way than the classical Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) since full bandwidth and transmission time are used in both layers. However, practical operation is restricted due to several implementation constraints such as the use of common parameters and transmitter blocks for both layers (e.g. a common time interleaver). The use of TFS allows for an improved frequency diversity by the distribution of the service data across multiple Radio Frequency (RF) channels instead of using a single RF channel. The paper investigates the potential gains provided by the increased frequency diversity with TFS in conjunction with LDM.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177282","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7161213/7177182/07177282.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of Layer Division Multiplexing (LDM) combined with Time Frequency Slicing (TFS)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177282/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of Layer Division Multiplexing (LDM) combined with Time Frequency Slicing (TFS)","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15347045","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177282/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of Layer Division Multiplexing (LDM) combined with Time Frequency Slicing (TFS)","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"MM15052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054908S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7161213","isNumber":"7177182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7161213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177182","articleId":"7177282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":7177300,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Research Centre Delft University of Technology, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Solid State Lighting Changzhou Base, Changzhou, China","School of Material Science and Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37695321500"},{"name":"Guoqi Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Research Centre Delft University of Technology, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Solid State Lighting Changzhou Base, Changzhou, China","DIMES Center for SSL Technologies University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"lastName":"Guoqi Zhang","id":"37087600464"},{"name":"Fenglian Sun","affiliation":["School of Material Science and Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Fenglian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37558323100"},{"name":"Xuejun Fan","affiliation":["Lamar University Texas, USA"],"lastName":"Xuejun Fan","id":"37087265081"},{"name":"Cell K.Y.

The basic rationale behind chroma subsampling is that the human visual system is less sensitive to color variations than luma variations. Therefore, chroma data can be coded in lower resolution than luma data, without noticeable loss in perceived image quality. In this paper, we compare different upsampling methods for chroma data and show that by using advanced upsampling schemes the fidelity of the reconstructed image can be significantly improved. We also present an adaptive upsampling method that uses full resolution luma information to assist chroma upsampling. Experimental results show that in the presence of compression noise, the proposed technique steadily outperforms advanced non-assisted upsampling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177387/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15346917","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving image fidelity by luma-assisted chroma subsampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving image fidelity by luma-assisted chroma subsampling","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084177S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160935","isNumber":"7177375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160935","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177375","articleId":"7177387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7177399,"authors":[{"name":"Tsu-Ming Liu","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsu-Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293265500"},{"name":"Yung-Chang Chang","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Chang","lastName":"Chang","id":"38184180300"},{"name":"Chih-Ming Wang","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Ming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088710538"},{"name":"Hue-Min Lin","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hue-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37655699100"},{"name":"Chia-Yun Cheng","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Yun","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37673779700"},{"name":"Chun-Chia Chen","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Chia","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293086400"},{"name":"Min-Hao Chiu","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Hao","lastName":"Chiu","id":"38468985500"},{"name":"Sheng-Jen Wang","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Jen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087610023"},{"name":"Ping Chao","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Chao","id":"38468960900"},{"name":"Meng-Jye Hu","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Jye","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085367828"},{"name":"Fu-Chun Yeh","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fu-Chun","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37085367309"},{"name":"Shun-Hsiang Chuang","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shun-Hsiang","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37085366076"},{"name":"Hsiu-Yi Lin","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiu-Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085366847"},{"name":"Ming-Long Wu","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Long","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085356626"},{"name":"Che-Hong Chen","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-Hong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085346555"},{"name":"Chia-Lin Ho","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Lin","lastName":"Ho","id":"37085352012"},{"name":"Chi-Cheng Ju","affiliation":["Mediatek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Cheng","lastName":"Ju","id":"37612608500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7082-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"7177399","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"abstract":"A 4K and Main-10 HEVC video decoder LSI is fabricated in a 28nm CMOS process.

However, saliency detection with single-scale superpixel segmentation may fail in capturing the intrinsic salient objects in complex natural scenes with small-scale high-contrast backgrounds. To tackle this problem and realize more reliable saliency detection, we present a simple strategy using multiscale superpixels to jointly detect salient object via low-rank analysis. Specifically, we construct a multiscale superpixel pyramid and derive the corresponding saliency map using multiple saliency features and priors for each single scale at first. Then, we show that by joint low-rank analysis of multiscale saliency maps, we can obtain a more reliable adaptively fused saliency map that takes all scales saliency results into account. We further propose a GMM-based co-saliency prior to enable the above approach to detecting co-salient objects from multiple images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency and co-saliency detection by low-rank multiscale fusion","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2015.7177414","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160935/7177375/07177414.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2015.7177414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Saliency and co-saliency detection by low-rank multiscale fusion","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177414/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15346964","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency and co-saliency detection by low-rank multiscale fusion","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04949S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160935","isNumber":"7177375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160935","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7177375","articleId":"7177414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177418,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Lin Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University"],"firstName":"Yu-Lin","lastName":"Chien","id":"37085521708"},{"name":"Kate Ching-Ju Lin","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica"],"firstName":"Kate Ching-Ju","lastName":"Lin","id":"38238733400"},{"name":"Ming-Syan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University"],"firstName":"Ming-Syan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280976600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7082-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"7177418","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":735},"abstract":"Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has become an emerging application nowadays. Video rate adaptation is a key to determine the video quality of HTTP-based media streaming. Recent works have proposed several algorithms that allow a DASH client to adapt its video encoding rate to network dynamics. While network conditions are typically affected by many different factors, these algorithms however usually consider only a few representative information, e.g., predicted available bandwidth or fullness of its playback buffer. In addition, the error in bandwidth estimation could significantly degrade their performance. Therefore, this paper presents Machine Learning-based Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MLASH), an elastic framework that exploits a wide range of useful network-related features to train a rate classification model. The distinct properties of MLASH are that its machine learning-based framework can be incorporated with any existing adaptation algorithm and utilize big data characteristics to improve prediction accuracy. We show via trace-based simulations that machine learning-based adaptation can achieve a better performance than traditional adaptation algorithms in terms of their target quality of experience (QoE) metrics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo

This task has broad social impact, but is still very challenging due to the complexity and large variations in hand actions. Existing methods for SLR use hand-crafted features to describe sign language motion and build classification models based on those features. However, it is difficult to design reliable features to adapt to the large variations of hand gestures. To approach this problem, we propose a novel 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) which extracts discriminative spatial-temporal features from raw video stream automatically without any prior knowledge, avoiding designing features. To boost the performance, multi-channels of video streams, including color information, depth clue, and body joint positions, are used as input to the 3D CNN in order to integrate color, depth and trajectory information. We validate the proposed model on a real dataset collected with Microsoft Kinect and demonstrate its effectiveness over the traditional approaches based on hand-crafted features.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2015.7177428","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160935/7177375/07177428.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2015.7177428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sign Language Recognition using 3D convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177428/","displayDocTitle":"Sign Language Recognition using 3D convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177428/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15346939","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sign Language Recognition using 3D convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06054S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160935","isNumber":"7177375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160935","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"7177375","articleId":"7177428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7177449,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Chuan Peng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kuan-Chuan","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085464461"},{"name":"Tsuhan Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tsuhan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276683300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7082-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"7177449","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":328},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177449","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Feature extraction","Neural networks","Accuracy","Testing","Silicon","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale feature extraction","multiscale convolutional neural networks","MSCNN","label-inheritable property","LI property","artistic style classification","architectural style classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks","multi-scale","label-inheritable"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICME.2015.7177449","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160935/7177375/07177449.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2015.7177449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework of extracting multi-scale features using multiple convolutional neural networks","abstract":"Most works related to convolutional neural networks (CNN) use the traditional CNN framework which extracts features in only one scale.

Thus, it is very difficult to handle large intra-class variations for face images. In this paper, we propose a one-pass dictionary learning algorithm to derive an auxiliary dictionary from external data, which consists of image variants of the subjects not of interest (not to be recognized). The proposed algorithm not only allows us to efficiently model intra-class variations such as illumination and expression changes, it also exhibits excellent abilities in recognizing corrupted images due to occlusion. In our experiments, we will show that our method would perform favorably against existing sparse representation or dictionary learning based approaches. Moreover, our computation time is remarkably less than that of recent dictionary learning based face recognition methods. Therefore, the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm can be successfully verified.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2015.7177451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2015.7177451","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160935/7177375/07177451.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Undersampled face recognition with one-pass dictionary learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Undersampled face recognition with one-pass dictionary learning","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177451/","accessionNumber":"15346962","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177451/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Undersampled face recognition with one-pass dictionary learning","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047919S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160935","isNumber":"7177375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160935","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177375","articleId":"7177451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177453,"authors":[{"name":"Wataru Shimoda","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Wataru","lastName":"Shimoda","id":"37085413598"},{"name":"Keiji Yanai","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiji","lastName":"Yanai","id":"37374951300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7082-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"7177453","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Visualization","Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Neural networks","Compounds","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image denoising","image filtering","image recognition","image representation","natural language processing","neural nets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual analysis","recognizability","discriminability","Japanese onomatopoeia words","visual appearance","visual recognition method","Web image search engine","image noise filtering","image reranking method","improved Fisher vector","IFV","deep convolutional neural network","noun pair","DCNN feature extraction","Overfeat network","ILSVRC 2013 data","onomatopoeia image representation","visual characteristics","linear SVM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["onomatopoeia","Web images","DCNN features"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we examine the relation between onomatopoeia and images using a large number of Web images.

By the experiments, it has been shown that the DCNN features extracted from the layer 7 of Overfeat's network pre-trained with the ILSVRC 2013 data have prominent ability to represent onomatopoeia images, and most of the onomatopoeia words have visual characteristics which can be recognized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A visual analysis on recognizability and discriminability of onomatopoeia words with DCNN features","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2015.7177453","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160935/7177375/07177453.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2015.7177453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"A visual analysis on recognizability and discriminability of onomatopoeia words with DCNN features","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177453/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15346960","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A visual analysis on recognizability and discriminability of onomatopoeia words with DCNN features","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05128S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160935","isNumber":"7177375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160935","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7177375","articleId":"7177453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177461,"authors":[{"name":"Yemin Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yemin Shi","id":"37088206617"},{"name":"Wei Zeng","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Zeng","id":"37087179687"},{"name":"Tiejun Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tiejun Huang","id":"37087149241"},{"name":"Yaowei Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yaowei Wang","id":"37087567949"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7082-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"7177461","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":700},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177461","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Videos","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Neural networks","Convolution","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","image texture","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning deep trajectory descriptor","human action recognition","deep neural networks","dense-trajectory-based methods","DTD descriptor","trajectory texture images","DNN","HOG","HOF","MBH","UCF50","KTH"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Network","Deep Trajectory Descriptor","action recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICME.2015.7177461","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160935/7177375/07177461.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2015.7177461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Deep Trajectory Descriptor for action recognition in videos using deep neural networks","abstract":"Human action recognition is widely recognized as a challenging task due to the difficulty of effectively characterizing human action in a complex scene. Recent studies have shown that the dense-trajectory-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art recognition results on some challenging datasets. However, in these methods, each dense trajectory is often represented as a vector of coordinates, consequently losing the structural relationship between different trajectories. To address the problem, this paper proposes a novel Deep Trajectory Descriptor (DTD) for action recognition. First, we extract dense trajectories from multiple consecutive frames and then project them onto a canvas. This will result in a \u201ctrajectory texture\u201d image which can effectively characterize the relative motion in these frames. Based on these trajectory texture images, a deep neural network (DNN) is utilized to learn a more compact and powerful representation of dense trajectories. In the action recognition system, the DTD descriptor, together with other non-trajectory features such as HOG, HOF and MBH, can provide an effective way to characterize human action from various aspects. Experimental results show that our system can statistically outperform several state-of-the-art approaches, with an average accuracy of 95:6% on KTH and an accuracy of 92.14% on UCF50.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177461/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15346864","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177461/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning Deep Trajectory Descriptor for action recognition in videos using deep neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Deep Trajectory Descriptor for action recognition in videos using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Turin","sourcePdf":"Paper350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06936S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160935","isNumber":"7177375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160935","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7177375","articleId":"7177461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7177464,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Herranz","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Lab of Intell.

This dish recognition problem is very challenging, due to different cuisines, cooking styles and the intrinsic difficulty of modeling food from its visual appearance. Contextual knowledge is crucial to improve recognition in such scenario. In particular, geocontext has been widely exploited for outdoor landmark recognition. Similarly, we exploit knowledge about menus and geolocation of restaurants and test images. We first adapt a framework based on discarding unlikely categories located far from the test image. Then we reformulate the problem using a probabilistic model connecting dishes, restaurants and geolocations. We apply that model in three different tasks: dish recognition, restaurant recognition and geolocation refinement. Experiments on a dataset including 187 restaurants and 701 dishes show that combining multiple evidences (visual, geolocation, and external knowledge) can boost the performance in all tasks.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7160935/7177375/07177464.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic model for food image recognition in restaurants","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2015.7177464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2015.7177464","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic model for food image recognition in restaurants","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15346908","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177464/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic model for food image recognition in restaurants","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094741S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160935","isNumber":"7177375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160935","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177375","articleId":"7177464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177491,"authors":[{"name":"Pin Tao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Pervasive Lab of TNList, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Pin Tao","id":"37087745307"},{"name":"Lixin Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Pervasive Lab of TNList, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lixin Feng","id":"37087686514"},{"name":"Sichao Song","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Pervasive Lab of TNList, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Sichao Song","id":"37087294563"},{"name":"Jiangtao Wen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Pervasive Lab of TNList, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jiangtao Wen","id":"37087253472"},{"name":"Shiqiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Pervasive Lab of TNList, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shiqiang Yang","id":"37087276771"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7082-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"7177491","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"abstract":"Screen Content (SC) video coding becomes more important for screen sharing and screen broadcasting applications. There are many easy to see different characters between screen content video and camera-captured video. We proposed a template matching prediction method for lossless SC intra picture coding with higher compression ratio. The pixels are re-sampled to form the Virtual Largest Coding Unit (VLCU) firstly. About 80% pixels in VLCU can be predicted exactly by template matching with zero error. Then, pixels with non-zero prediction error should be coded with three information, index, position and value. Among these three, position will consume the most bits than the other two. In order to handle this challenge, we propose to apply the similarity of non-zero prediction error pixel positions of neighbor VLCU which can greatly help to improve the compression performance. The VLCU can be divided into sub CU as the same as the division in the standard High Efficiency Video Coding(HEVC) intra coding, and RDO is applied to find the best coding

First, seed candidate characters are detected with discriminative deep convolutional features learned within the maximally stable extremal regions extracted from the image, and are further grown to localize other degraded candidate characters. Next, as a finer filtering of text in the richer text line context, the random forest classifier is exploited on statistical features of text line characterizing the geometrical and conformability properties of constituent character components, to predict the text and non-text label.

Inspired by the success of rigid hierarchical classification, we propose a new flexible hierarchical classification method, called a data-driven taxonomy forest. It constructs a multitude of taxonomies, each of which converts a complex multi-class problem to a more easily tractable path-finding problem. We demonstrate how a stochastic representation of local classification hypotheses incorporated in multiple taxonomies deals skillfully with error propagation and over-fitting. Various strategies for instance space decomposition are investigated from the viewpoint of taxonomy complexity. We comprehensively evaluate our data-driven taxonomy forest using Oxford Flower 102 and Oxford Pet benchmarks and show its superiority in effectiveness and generality to rigid hierarchical classification in fine-grained image categorization tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7177530/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15346880","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven taxonomy forest for fine-grained image categorization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven taxonomy forest for fine-grained image categorization","confLoc":"Turin","sourcePdf":"Paper93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075074S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7160935","isNumber":"7177375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7160935","xplore-issue":"7177375","articleId":"7177530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7177554,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The WRNN does not provides only a prediction for the wavelet coefficients like in other previous studies of the authors in this research area but it is able to reconstruct directly the power signal from band-selected coefficients. The presented approach does not provides only an accurate forecasting model respect to the state of art in the field, but it is also useful for case studies which suffer of a major lack of wind data regarding the geographic site and of accurate and long historical study of the wind speed time series. In fact due to the proposed method of training based on a semiparametric input data preprocessing as Parzen windows then wind power output forecasting is improved.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEP.2015.7177554","startPage":"602","endPage":"609","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Clean Electrical Power (ICCEP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEP.2015.7177554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177533","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Clean Electrical Power (ICCEP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7155396/7177533/07177554.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet recurrent neural network with semi-parametric input data preprocessing for micro-wind power forecasting in integrated generation Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177554/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wavelet recurrent neural network with semi-parametric input data preprocessing for micro-wind power forecasting in integrated generation Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177554/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15346550","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet recurrent neural network with semi-parametric input data preprocessing for micro-wind power forecasting in integrated generation Systems","confLoc":"Taormina, Italy","sourcePdf":"P127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074164S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7155396","isNumber":"7177533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7155396","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7177533","articleId":"7177554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7177576,"authors":[{"name":"F.

If a micro-grid including a PV installation is connected to the grid by means of a front end converter, multiple possible cases of fault may occur. It is a typical feature of such configuration that, depending on fault resistance and location, fault currents from the AC grid may pass unlimited through the converter and contribute to the fault. Most general purpose converters are not able to interrupt fault currents in all situations. A specific protection system is then required to ensure fault clearance and maintain safety. Two possible philosophies for such a protection system are described in this paper, one based on future solid state circuit-breakers, and one based on electromechanical devices complemented by front end converter design modification. Advantages and drawbacks are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault protection analysis in low voltage DC microgrids with PV generators","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Clean Electrical Power (ICCEP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCEP.2015.7177621","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Clean Electrical Power (ICCEP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7155396/7177533/07177621.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEP.2015.7177621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fault protection analysis in low voltage DC microgrids with PV generators","conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177621/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15346487","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault protection analysis in low voltage DC microgrids with PV generators","confLoc":"Taormina, Italy","sourcePdf":"SA322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070341S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7155396","isNumber":"7177533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7155396","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7177533","articleId":"7177621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177703,"authors":[{"name":"Sunghwan Shin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, Geyongbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghwan","lastName":"Shin","id":"38238928100"},{"name":"Reza Haghighi Osgouei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, Geyongbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Reza Haghighi","lastName":"Osgouei","id":"38527415600"},{"name":"Ki-Duk Kim","affiliation":["LG Display, Co.

We then propose two neural network models with different topologies: a unified model that feeds all of acceleration data, scanning velocity, and normal force as input variables to a single large neural network and a decomposed model that consists of a number of smaller neural networks each of which is trained with the acceleration data for a pair of scanning velocity and normal force.

The core part of the approach is a novel input variable set for data interpolation model training, which includes the position of a proxy - the contact point on a surface when undeformed. This enables us to estimate friction in both sliding and sticking states. The behavior of the proxy is simulated in real-time based on a sliding yield surface - a cone-shaped surface separating the sliding and the sticking area in the external force space, identified through an automated palpation procedure. During modeling, input data and resultant force data are collected through manual palpation of a target object, which are used to build a radial-basis interpolation model. During rendering, this interpolation model with interaction inputs estimates force responses in real-time. Performance evaluation shows that our approach achieves reasonable estimation accuracy.

The results of this analysis show that devices in analog circuits experience unequal stress acceleration and this impacts lifetime estimates at use conditions and can cause some devices to fail relatively more frequently under accelerated conditions in comparison with use conditions. We calculate the impact of voltage and temperature acceleration on circuits by combining the impact of voltage and temperature acceleration on each device to find the circuit-level acceleration factors. Because the acceleration factors are not constant for analog circuits, we propose to use reliability simulation to properly estimate acceleration factors under the uneven stress conditions experienced by mixed-signal circuits. The acceleration factors can then be used to estimate circuit lifetime at use conditions, given empirical data on failure rates of chips at high temperature and voltage stress conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177872/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15346827","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177872/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impact of stress acceleration on mixed-signal gate oxide lifetime","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of stress acceleration on mixed-signal gate oxide lifetime","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"R53impactofstress.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086403S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7159924","isNumber":"7177856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7159924","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177856","articleId":"7177872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177876,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Renaud","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Renaud","id":"37089042931"},{"name":"Manuel J.

The method uses a null-steered beamformer. In simulations the proposed method yields accurate DRR estimates to within \u00b14 dB across a wide variety of room sizes, reverberation times and source-receiver distances. It is also shown that the proposed method is more robust to background noise than a baseline approach. The best estimation accuracy is obtained in the region from -5 to 5 dB which is a relevant range for portable devices.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177929","startPage":"46","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07177929.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct-to-Reverberant Ratio estimation using a null-steered beamformer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Speech","Noise","Estimation","Reverberation","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","reverberation","speech intelligibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-to-reverberant ratio estimation","null-steered beamformer","distant speech","acoustic configuration","novel DRR estimation algorithm","reverberation times","source-receiver distances","room sizes","speech intelligibility","speech quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech enhancement","speech dereverberation","beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Direct-to-Reverberant Ratio estimation using a null-steered beamformer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177929/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361463","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct-to-Reverberant Ratio estimation using a null-steered beamformer","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051511S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7177929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7177932,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Hui Tu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.

We adopt a divide and conquer strategy to design the proposed SND-DNNs with higher resolutions that a single general DNN could not well accommodate for all the speaker mixing variabilities at different levels of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this study two kinds of SNR-dependent DNNs, namely positive and negative DNNs, are trained to cover the mixed speech signals with positive and negative SNR levels, respectively. At the separation stage, a first-pass separation using a general DNN can give an accurate SNR estimation for a model selection. Experimental results on the Speech Separation Challenge (SSC) task show that SND-DNNs could yield significant performance improvements for both speech separation and recognition over a general DNN. Furthermore, this purely front-end processing method achieves a relative word error rate reduction of 11.6% over a state-of-the-art recognition system where a complicated joint decoding framework needs to be implemented in the back-end.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362203","htmlLink":"/document/7177932/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speech Separation based on signal-noise-dependent deep neural networks for robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Separation based on signal-noise-dependent deep neural networks for robust speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074506S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7177932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177933,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Le Roux","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Le Roux","id":"37285996500"},{"name":"John R.

However, inference in NMF-based models relies on iterative inference methods, typically formulated as multiplicative updates. We propose \u201cdeep NMF\u201d, a novel non-negative deep network architecture which results from unfolding the NMF iterations and untying its parameters. This architecture can be discriminatively trained for optimal separation performance. To optimize its non-negative parameters, we show how a new form of back-propagation, based on multiplicative updates, can be used to preserve non-negativity, without the need for constrained optimization. We show on a challenging speech separation task that deep NMF improves in terms of accuracy upon NMF and is competitive with conventional sigmoid deep neural networks, while requiring a tenth of the number of parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07177933.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep NMF for speech separation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Training","Context","Noise","Topology","Neural networks","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","backpropagation","inference mechanisms","iterative methods","matrix decomposition","source separation","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep NMF","deep nonnegative matrix factorization","speech separation task","single-channel audio source separation tasks","iterative inference methods","multiplicative updates","nonnegative deep network architecture","NMF iterations","nonnegative parameter optimization","back-propagation","nonnegativity preservation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep unfolding","Non-negative Matrix Factorization","Deep Neural Network","Non-negative Back-propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deep NMF for speech separation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177933/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361623","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep NMF for speech separation","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059863S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7177933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177935,"authors":[{"name":"Antoine Liutkus","affiliation":["Inria speech processing team, Villers-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Liutkus","id":"38557427700"},{"name":"Derry Fitzgerald","affiliation":["NIMBUS Centre, Cork Institute of Technology, Ireland"],"firstName":"Derry","lastName":"Fitzgerald","id":"37285272600"},{"name":"Zafar Rafii","affiliation":["Gracenote, Media Technology Lab, Emeryville, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zafar","lastName":"Rafii","id":"37712966300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7177935","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Spectrogram","Source separation","Harmonic analysis","Additives","Approximation methods","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","compressed sensing","median filters","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light kernel additive modelling","KAM","multichannel audio source separation","REPET","harmonic-percussive separation","median filters","memory usage","full-resolution spectrogram","compression algorithm","mobile devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sound source separation","Kernel Additive Modelling","randomized algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Recently, Kernel Additive Modelling (KAM) was proposed as a unified framework to achieve multichannel audio source separation. Its main feature is to use kernel models for locally describing the spectrograms of the sources. Such kernels can capture source features such as repetitivity, stability over time and/or frequency, self-similarity, etc. KAM notably subsumes many popular and effective methods from the state of the art, including REPET and harmonic/percussive separation with median filters. However, it also comes with an important drawback in its initial form: its memory usage badly scales with the number of sources. Indeed, KAM requires the storage of the full-resolution spectrogram for each source, which may become prohibitive for full-length tracks or many sources. In this paper, we show how it can be combined with a fast compression algorithm of its parameters to address the scalability issue, thus enabling its use on small platforms or mobile devices.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177935","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07177935.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177935","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","startPage":"76","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable audio separation with light Kernel Additive Modelling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Scalable audio separation with light Kernel Additive Modelling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177935/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177935/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361909","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable audio separation with light Kernel Additive Modelling","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076711S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7177935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177943,"authors":[{"name":"Shoko Araki","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoko","lastName":"Araki","id":"37085486327"},{"name":"Tomoki Hayashi","affiliation":["Department of Media Science, Nagoya University 1 Furo-cho Chikusa-ku, Nagoya-shi, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37085521002"},{"name":"Marc Delcroix","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Delcroix","id":"37425994200"},{"name":"Masakiyo Fujimoto","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masakiyo","lastName":"Fujimoto","id":"37284332300"},{"name":"Kazuya Takeda","affiliation":["Department of Media Science, Nagoya University 1 Furo-cho Chikusa-ku, Nagoya-shi, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuya","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37085506435"},{"name":"Tomohiro Nakatani","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37342222600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7177943","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1405},"abstract":"This paper investigates a multi-channel denoising autoencoder (DAE)-based speech enhancement approach.

Our experimental study shows that the achieved precision of clock synchronization enables sufficient accuracy of clock synchronization for the MVDR beamformer in ideal scenarios.

The major challenge with this approach is the accuracy of the clustering algorithm in the second step, especially as most previously used clustering algorithms are focusing on the frequency part of NMF only and, hence, are missing the information of the time activation matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering criterion which combines the frequency and time activation part of NMF. It is based on the linear predictive coding compression error and we show that it allows a good clustering of the NMF components while at the same time can be efficiently computed. Our new clustering criterion shows an overall improved performance compared with the current state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as we experiment on the TRIOS dataset.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07177972.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"265","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NMF-based blind source separation using a linear predictive coding error clustering criterion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Bismuth","Merging","World Wide Web","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","blind source separation","linear predictive coding","matrix decomposition","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NMF-based blind source separation","linear predictive coding error clustering criterion","nonnegative matrix factorization","sound source separation","signal spectrum","source signal spectra","clustering algorithm","state-of-the-art clustering algorithm","TRIOS dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)","Linear predictive coding (LPC)","Blind source separation (BSS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"NMF-based blind source separation using a linear predictive coding error clustering criterion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177972/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15346703","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NMF-based blind source separation using a linear predictive coding error clustering criterion","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064267S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7177972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177973,"authors":[{"name":"Antoine Liutkus","affiliation":["Inria, Speech processing team, Villers-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Liutkus","id":"38557427700"},{"name":"Roland Badeau","affiliation":["Inria, Speech processing team, Villers-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Badeau","id":"38556089800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7177973","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177973","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectrogram","Source separation","Speech","Speech processing","Probabilistic logic","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","Fourier transforms","music","probability","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wiener filtering","fractional power spectrograms","single-sensor separation","soft-masking strategy","Fourier transform","spectrogram models","probabilistic interpretation","\u03b1-stable harmonizable processes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["audio source separation","probability theory","harmonizable processes","\u03b1-stable random variables","soft-masks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177973","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07177973.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Wiener filtering with fractional power spectrograms","abstract":"In the recent years, many studies have focused on the single-sensor separation of independent waveforms using so-called soft-masking strategies, where the short term Fourier transform of the mixture is multiplied element-wise by a ratio of spectrogram models. When the signals are wide-sense stationary, this strategy is theoretically justified as an optimal Wiener filtering: the power spectrograms of the sources are supposed to add up to yield the power spectrogram of the mixture. However, experience shows that using fractional spectrograms instead, such as the amplitude, yields good performance in practice, because they experimentally better fit the additivity assumption. To the best of our knowledge, no probabilistic interpretation of this filtering procedure was available to date. In this paper, we show that assuming the additivity of fractional spectrograms for the purpose of building soft-masks can be understood as separating locally stationary \u03b1-stable harmonizable processes, \u03b1-harmonizable in short, thus justifying the procedure theoretically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177973/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15362017","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7177973/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Wiener filtering with fractional power spectrograms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Wiener filtering with fractional power spectrograms","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080823S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7177973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7177976,"authors":[{"name":"Hirofumi Nakajima","affiliation":["Kogakuin University"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Nakajima","id":"37555790500"},{"name":"Naoto Sakata","affiliation":["Kogakuin University"],"firstName":"Naoto","lastName":"Sakata","id":"37085484114"},{"name":"Kihiro Hashino","affiliation":["Kogakuin University"],"firstName":"Kihiro","lastName":"Hashino","id":"37085479491"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7177976","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loudspeakers","Acoustic distortion","Computational efficiency","Distortion measurement","Harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic distortion","acoustic radiators","acoustic signal processing","loudspeakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear distortion reduction","recursive source equalization","sound reproduction systems","multiloudspeakers","multisound sources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-linear distortion","Loudspeaker","Recursive equalization","Sound quality equalization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7177976","abstract":"This paper proposes a method of reducing nonlinear distortion in sound reproduction systems by recursively equalizing input signals.

The DNNs is trained to learn characteristics reflecting the level of speech information at different TFPs, which helps to generate a reliable spectral mask for obtaining a noise-reduced spectral. Correspondingly, a robust DOA estimation algorithm named as AVS-DNN-ISDR has been developed.

The necessary statistics are estimated over a long time window and often, a complete utterance is chosen. Consequently, changes in the background noise can only be tracked to a limited extent which poses a restriction to the performance gain that can be achieved by these techniques. In contrast, algorithms recently developed for single-channel speech enhancement allow to track the background noise quickly. In this paper, we aim at combining speech enhancement techniques and feature normalization methods. For this, we propose to transform an estimate of the noise power spectral density to the MFCC domain, where we subtract it from the noisy MFCCs. This is followed by a conventional CMVN. For background noises that are too instationary for CMVN but can be tracked by the noise estimator, we show that this processing leads to an improvement in comparison to the sole application of CMVN. The observed performance gain emerges especially in low signal-to-noise-ratios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7177994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361171","htmlLink":"/document/7177994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cepstral noise subtraction for robust automatic speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cepstral noise subtraction for robust automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068991S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7177994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178001,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Durand","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom, Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Durand","id":"37085567544"},{"name":"Juan P.

It is well-known that multi-source DOA estimation in an enclosed environment is challenging due to room reverberation, environmental noise and overlapping of the source spectra. In this work, we propose a multi-source DOA estimation algorithm which exploits co-location of the sensor elements in AVS. We identify time-frequency (TF) zones of the received signals in which only one source is dominant with a high signal-to-reverberation ratio. DOA estimation is then achieved via the use of clustering of the Hermitian angle feature. Simulation results show that the proposed DOA estimation algorithm is robust to both reverberation and environmental noise.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178008","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178008.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178008","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","startPage":"444","endPage":"448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-source direction-of-arrival estimation in a reverberant environment using single acoustic vector sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-source direction-of-arrival estimation in a reverberant environment using single acoustic vector sensor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178008/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178008/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361361","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-source direction-of-arrival estimation in a reverberant environment using single acoustic vector sensor","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077355S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7178013,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For obtaining better source models, we introduce a single-channel source separation method, and utilize the outputs as source variances in time-frequency-variant Gaussian source model. The demixing matrices are estimated in the same way as a state-of-the-art IVA method, auxiliary-function-based IVA (AuxIVA). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach is effective and improves the source separation performance of IVA. In addition, several post-filters aiming to realize multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) are investigated. This setup proves to further increase the performance of IVA.

Since noise corruption may be unavoidable in practical situations, it is important to develop more robust features and classifiers. Recent advances in this field use powerful machine learning techniques with high dimensional input features such as spectrograms or auditory image. These improve robustness largely thanks to the discriminative capabilities of the back end classifiers. We extend this further by proposing novel features derived from spectrogram energy triggering, allied with the powerful classification capabilities of a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method demonstrates excellent performance under noise-corrupted conditions when compared against state-of-the-art approaches on standard evaluation tasks.

Recently an extension of the binaural Multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF), namely the MWF-IC, has been presented which aims to preserve the Interaural Coherence (IC) of the noise component. Since for the MWF-IC no closed-form solution exists, in this paper we propose to preserve the IC using the binaural MWF with partial noise estimation (MWF-N), for which a closed-form solution exists. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the trade-off parameter in the MWF-N yielding a predefined IC at the filter output. Experimental results in a diffuse noise scenario show that both the MWF-IC and the MWF-N preserve the IC of the output noise component.

Previous work has shown that estimating a masking function to be applied to the noisy spectrum is a viable approach that can be improved by using a signal-approximation based objective function. Better modeling of dynamics through deep recurrent networks has also been shown to improve performance. Here we pursue both of these directions. We develop a phase-sensitive objective function based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the reconstructed signal, and show that in experiments it yields uniformly better results in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). We also investigate improvements to the modeling of dynamics, using bidirectional recurrent networks, as well as by incorporating speech recognition outputs in the form of alignment vectors concatenated with the spectral input features. Both methods yield further improvements, pointing to tighter integration of recognition with separation as a promising future direction.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178061","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178061.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-sensitive and recognition-boosted speech separation using deep recurrent neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Phase-sensitive and recognition-boosted speech separation using deep recurrent neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178061/","publicationDate":"April 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361465","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178061/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-sensitive and recognition-boosted speech separation using deep recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081738S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"244","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7178063,"authors":[{"name":"Tak-Shing Chan","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tak-Shing","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085540918"},{"name":"Tzu-Chun Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Chun","lastName":"Yeh","id":"38469757300"},{"name":"Zhe-Cheng Fan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhe-Cheng","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085543312"},{"name":"Hung-Wei Chen","affiliation":["iKala Interactive Media Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085541523"},{"name":"Li Su","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Su","id":"37077544500"},{"name":"Yi-Hsuan Yang","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Hsuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37539106300"},{"name":"Roger Jang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Jang","id":"37085528918"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178063","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":520},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information services","Electronic publishing","Internet","Harmonic analysis","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component analysis","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vocal activity informed singing voice separation","iKala dataset","robust principal component analysis","predefined sparsity pattern","MIR-IK dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-rank and sparse decomposition","singing voice separation","informed source separation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178063","abstract":"A new algorithm is proposed for robust principal component analysis with predefined sparsity patterns.

Experimental results on both the MIR-1K dataset and the new iKala dataset confirmed that the more informed the algorithm is, the better the separation results are.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178063","startPage":"718","endPage":"722","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178063.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vocal activity informed singing voice separation with the iKala dataset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Vocal activity informed singing voice separation with the iKala dataset","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178063/","accessionNumber":"15362070","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178063/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vocal activity informed singing voice separation with the iKala dataset","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081646S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178069,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper introduces an additional method for leveraging both approaches that exploits channel estimates in a wanted spatial location and derives robustness from knowledge of the array geometry alone.

However, to achieve a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for an accurate lesion detection and quantification in the PET/MR images, one has to overcome the induced respiratory motion artifacts. The simultaneous acquisition allows performing a MR-based non-rigid motion correction of the PET data. It is essential to acquire a 4D (3D + time) motion model as accurate and fast as possible to minimize additional MR scan time overhead. Therefore, a Compressed Sensing (CS) acquisition by means of a variable-density Gaussian subsampling is employed to achieve high accelerations. Reformulating the sparse reconstruction as a combination of the inverse CS problem with a non-rigid motion correction improves the accuracy by alternately projecting the reconstruction results on either the motion-compensated CS reconstruction or on the motion model optimization. In-vivo patient data substantiates the diagnostic improvement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Compressed Sensing with motion correction in acquisition and reconstruction for PET/MR","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178077","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178077.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Combining Compressed Sensing with motion correction in acquisition and reconstruction for PET/MR","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178077/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361641","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Compressed Sensing with motion correction in acquisition and reconstruction for PET/MR","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085061S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178094,"authors":[{"name":"Alice P.

of-the-art classification and segmentation for the MICCAI 2014 Brain Tumor Digital Pathology Challenge. Common traits of such medical image challenges are characterized by large image dimensions (up to the gigabyte size of an image), a limited amount of training data, and significant clinical feature representations. To tackle these challenges, we transfer the features extracted from CNNs trained with a very large general image database to the medical image challenge. In this paper, we used CNN activations trained by ImageNet to extract features (4096 neurons, 13.3% active). In addition, feature selection, feature pooling, and data augmentation are used in our work.

With recent advancements in technology and research, this dream has become a reality for some through the use of a Brain Computer/Machine Interface (BCI/BMI). One of the most important goals of BCI is to enable handicap people to control artificial limbs. Some research proposed wireless implants that do not require chronic wound in the skull. However, the communications consume a high bandwidth and power that exceeds the allowed limits, 8-10mW. This study proposes and implements a modified version of real-time spike sorting for wireless BCI [4] that simplifies and uses less computation via an adaptive neural-structure; which makes it simpler, faster and power and area efficient. The system was implemented, and simulated using Modalism and Cadence, with ideal case and worst case accuracy of 100% and 91.7%, respectively.

However, list pruning in the current list decoding is based on the sorting strategy and its timing complexity is high. This results in a long decoding latency for large list size. In this work, aiming at a low-latency list decoding implementation, a double thresholding algorithm is proposed for a fast list pruning. As a result, with a negligible performance degradation, the list pruning delay is greatly reduced. Based on the double thresholding, a low-latency list decoding architecture is proposed and implemented using a UMC 90nm CMOS technology.

However, they suffer from long training time, which demands parallel implementations of the training procedure. Parallelization of the training algorithms for RNNs are very challenging because internal recurrent paths form dependencies between two different time frames. In this paper, we first propose a generalized graph-based RNN structure that covers the most popular long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Then, we present a parallelization approach that automatically explores parallelisms of arbitrary RNNs by analyzing the graph structure. The experimental results show that the proposed approach shows great speed-up even with a single training stream, and further accelerates the training when combined with multiple parallel training streams.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361608","htmlLink":"/document/7178129/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Single stream parallelization of generalized LSTM-like RNNs on a GPU","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single stream parallelization of generalized LSTM-like RNNs on a GPU","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043083S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7178130,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085366910"},{"name":"Huaida Liu","affiliation":["Department of Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huaida","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085347825"},{"name":"Pingui Jia","affiliation":["Department of Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pingui","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085363283"},{"name":"Yiping Yang","affiliation":["Department of Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yiping","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085345041"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178130","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Decoding","Reliability","Software","Polynomials","Hardware","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","flash memories","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive ECC scheme","dynamic protection","NAND flash memories","error correcting code","BCH codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correcting code","flash memories","adaptive protection","software","BCH"]}],"abstract":"Error correcting code (ECC) is an essential method in protection of NAND Flash memories. Complexity of it is increasing rapidly with the increment of error correction capability. Traditionally, the software implementation of ECC which has less cost and high flexibility is nearly ignored due to its inefficiency. This situation can be changed by design of faster software-based ECC scheme. We have found that the reliability is constantly changing with Program/Erase cycles and retention time during the lifetime of memories. However, regular ECC methods fail to take into account the variable kinds of reliability and result in a great waste of computations. In order to achieve better software implementation, an adaptive ECC scheme is proposed to provide various amount of protection. By assigning appropriate ECC, an adaptive ECC with Hamming and more efficient BCH codes is designed to provide corresponding protection. Proposed ECC scheme is suitable for diverse devices and applications. The coding time can be obviously decreased, making it possible to replace hardware methods with software methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178130","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178130.pdf","startPage":"1052","endPage":"1055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive ECC scheme for dynamic protection of NAND Flash memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive ECC scheme for dynamic protection of NAND Flash memories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178130/","publicationDate":"April 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361184","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178130/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive ECC scheme for dynamic protection of NAND Flash memories","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05755S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7178132,"authors":[{"name":"Edward H.

In applications such as biomedical signal processing, the signals are real. The real-valued signals exhibit conjugate symmetry, giving rise to redundant values in the outputs. This property can be exploited to reduce arithmetic computations, area and power consumption. This paper presents hardware architectures for computing real FFT that exploits this conjugate symmetry property where the inputs are processed in a serial manner. This is facilitated by pushing the twiddle factor values across various butterfly stages. In this paper, two different serial FFT architectures are presented: one using real and the other using hybrid datapaths. These architectures process one sample per clock cycle and are well suited for low-sample-rate applications such as biomedical. These architectures are also modified so that two independent computations can be interleaved in the same datapath. The advantage of interleaving is reduction in area, and is attractive for applications where FFT computation of two independent real signals is required.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Delays","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Flow graphs","Clocks","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transform","interleaved architecture","serial architecture","digital signal processing application","arithmetic computation reduction","power consumption reduction","conjugate symmetry property","twiddle factor","hybrid datapath","sample per clock cycle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FFT","Real FFT","Serial Processing","Interleaving","Real Datapath","Hybrid Datapath"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178133","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1070","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178133.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Serial and interleaved architectures for computing real FFT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Serial and interleaved architectures for computing real FFT","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15362064","publicationDate":"April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178133/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Serial and interleaved architectures for computing real FFT","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056923S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178135,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lin","id":"38247795900"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085566351"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178135","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178135","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Computer architecture","Registers","TV","Indexes","Clocks","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid partial sum computation unit architecture","list decoders","polar codes","successive cancelation algorithm","SC based list decoding algorithms","lazy copy partial sum computation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar codes","list decoding","partial sum computation"]}],"abstract":"Although the successive cancelation (SC) algorithm works well for very long polar codes, its error performance for shorter polar codes is much worse. Several SC based list decoding algorithms have been proposed to improve the error performances of both long and short polar codes. A significant step of SC based list decoding algorithms is the updating of partial sums for all decoding paths. In this paper, we first proposed a lazy copy partial sum computation algorithm for SC based list decoding algorithms. Instead of copying partial sums directly, our lazy copy algorithm copies indices of partial sums. Based on our lazy copy algorithm, we propose a hybrid partial sum computation unit architecture, which employs both registers and memories so that the overall area efficiency is improved.

The learning capability of the network improves with increasing depth and size of each layer. However this capability comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. Thus reduction in hardware complexity and faster classification are highly desired. This work proposes an optimization method for fixed point deep convolutional neural networks. The parameters of a pre-trained high precision network are first directly quantized using L2 error minimization. We quantize each layer one by one, while other layers keep computation with high precision, to know the layer-wise sensitivity on word-length reduction. Then the network is retrained with quantized weights. Two examples on object recognition, MNIST and CIFAR-10, are presented. Our results indicate that quantization induces sparsity in the network which reduces the effective number of network parameters and improves generalization. This work reduces the required memory storage by a factor of 1/10 and achieves better classification results than the high precision networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178146","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178146.pdf","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed point optimization of deep convolutional neural networks for object recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fixed point optimization of deep convolutional neural networks for object recognition","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178146/","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361529","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178146/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed point optimization of deep convolutional neural networks for object recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077472S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7178154,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Yao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Yao","id":"37085540617"},{"name":"Keita Takahashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Keita","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37085466481"},{"name":"Mehrdad Panahpour Tehrani","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Panahpour Tehrani","id":"37313578900"},{"name":"Toshiaki Fujii","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiaki","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37277000000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178154","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Image coding","Indexes","Multiplexing","Position measurement","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint directional positional multiplexing","light field acquisition","Kronecker compressed sensing","KCS","2D spatial correlations","2D angular correlations","compressive acquisition","quality of light field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint multiplexing","Directional-Positional multiplexing","Kronecker compressed sensing (KCS)","Compressive light field acquisition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a joint and unified framework to compressively capture a light field in the consideration of both directional and positional multiplexing based on Kronecker compressed sensing (KCS). First of all, both of the 2D angular and 2D spatial correlations of the light field can be fully utilized in the compressive acquisition, and the multiplexing is more flexible and balanced during the acquisition. Secondly, other types of light field acquisition can be unified into our proposed framework. In the experiment, it is shown that more balanced allocation between directional and positional multiplexing achieves better reconstruction quality of light field given the same number of total acquisitions.

Prior studies have exploited the intra-band spatial correlation (leading to sparsity in transform domain) and inter-band spectral-correlation (joint-sparsity) of hyper-spectral images for Gaussian denoising. In this work, we propose to learn the joint-sparsity promoting dictionary adaptively from the data for impulse denoising problems. Unlike dictionary learning techniques, the sparsifying dictionary is not learnt in an offline training phase. We follow the Blind Compressed Sensing (BCS) framework - dictionary learning and denoising proceeds simultaneously. The optimization problem that arises out of our formulation is solved using the Split Bregman approach.

Several previous works have addressed color based image retrieval based on hand-crafted features. In this paper, a data-driven learning framework is proposed for generating color based signatures. To obtain the features, a linear transformation is learned from the pixel values based on its reconstruction error. Using this linear transformation, the original pixel values are transformed into a higher dimensional space. In the higher dimensional space, a dictionary is learned to obtain the sparse codes of the pixels. A max pooling strategy is used to obtain the dominant color features of a region and the final feature vector for an image is obtained by concatenating the pooled features. We evaluate our approach following the standard evaluation criteria for the INRIA Holidays and University of Kentucky Benchmark datasets. The approach is compared with several baselines such as histograms in RGB, HSV, YUV and Lab color spaces and several other color based features proposed for addressing this problem. Our approach shows competitive results on these datasets and outperforms all the baselines.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178187","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1338","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178187.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven color feature learning scheme for image retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven color feature learning scheme for image retrieval","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178187/","accessionNumber":"15362067","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178187/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven color feature learning scheme for image retrieval","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049203S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178196,"authors":[{"name":"Praveen Kulkarni","affiliation":["Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"37085595222"},{"name":"Joaquin Zepeda","affiliation":["Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Zepeda","id":"37293816700"},{"name":"Frederic Jurie","affiliation":["CNRS UMR, University of Caen Basse-Normandie, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Jurie","id":"37267287700"},{"name":"Patrick Perez","affiliation":["Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Perez","id":"37085595556"},{"name":"Louis Chevallier","affiliation":["Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Chevallier","id":"37085533541"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178196","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid multi-layer deep CNN/aggregator feature for image classification","abstract":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have established a remarkable performance benchmark in the field of image classification, displacing classical approaches based on hand-tailored aggregations of local descriptors. Yet DCNNs impose high computational burdens both at training and at testing time, and training them requires collecting and annotating large amounts of training data. Supervised adaptation methods have been proposed in the literature that partially re-learn a transferred DCNN structure from a new target dataset. Yet these require expensive bounding-box annotations and are still computationally expensive to learn. In this paper, we address these shortcomings of DCNN adaptation schemes by proposing a hybrid approach that combines conventional, unsupervised aggregators such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), with the DCNN pipeline by treating the output of intermediate layers as densely extracted local descriptors. We test a variant of our approach that uses only intermediate DCNN layers on the standard PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and show performance significantly higher than the standard BoW model and comparable to Fisher vector aggregation but with a feature that is 150 times smaller. A second variant of our approach that includes the fully connected DCNN layers significantly outperforms Fisher vector schemes and performs comparably to DCNN approaches adapted to Pascal VOC 2007, yet at only a small fraction of the training and testing cost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Pipelines","Feature extraction","Kernel","Testing","Convolutional codes","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","multilayer perceptrons","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid multilayer deep CNN feature","hybrid multilayer deep aggregator feature","image classification","deep convolutional neural networks","performance benchmark","supervised adaptation methods","DCNN adaptation schemes","bag-of-words","BoW model","unsupervised aggregators","PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","Bag-of-Words","Fisher Vector aggregator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178196","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178196","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1383","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178196.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178196/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid multi-layer deep CNN/aggregator feature for image classification","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361701","htmlLink":"/document/7178196/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid multi-layer deep CNN/aggregator feature for image classification","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063858S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178202,"authors":[{"name":"Sik-Ho Tsang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Sik-Ho","lastName":"Tsang","id":"37597835200"},{"name":"Yui-Lam Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yui-Lam","lastName":"Chan","id":"37274996200"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Wan-Chi","lastName":"Siu","id":"37270783500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178202","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Image coding","Image color analysis","Videos","Indexes","IEC","Colored noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intracoding techniques","smooth region","screen content coding","boundary prediction samples","intraprediction algorithms","screen content video","boundary sample smoothness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HEVC","Intra Prediction","Screen Content Coding","Smooth Region"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178202","abstract":"This paper presents fast and efficient intra prediction algorithms for screen content coding (SCC).

Generally, the backscattered signal of a moving target is sampled in fast time dimension, which can be approximated as the combination of multiple Chirp signals with a proper Chirp rate. Compared with the Fourier transform, the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) performs better compression property due to its unique energy focus ability to Chirp signals. An improved Cross-correlation method based on FrFT for parameter estimation is presented in this paper. It employs the correlation between range profiles compressed by FrFT to enhance the quality of parameter estimation for ISAR applications. The method takes good balance between accuracy and complexity, and is robust to noise. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional Cross-correlation Method in terms of ISAR translational MOCOMP.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178228","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178228.pdf","startPage":"1538","endPage":"1542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved cross-correlation approach to parameter estimation based on fractional Fourier transform for ISAR motion compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178228/","displayDocTitle":"An improved cross-correlation approach to parameter estimation based on fractional Fourier transform for ISAR motion compensation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361751","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178228/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved cross-correlation approach to parameter estimation based on fractional Fourier transform for ISAR motion compensation","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04389S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178240,"authors":[{"name":"Jiachao Zhang","affiliation":["University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Jiachao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085523900"},{"name":"Keigo Hirakawa","affiliation":["University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Keigo","lastName":"Hirakawa","id":"37295032600"},{"name":"Xiaodan Jin","affiliation":["University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085507448"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178240","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"abstract":"This paper describes a study aimed at comparing the real image sensor noise distribution to the models of noise often assumed in image denoising designs.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of methods for fully-automatic face recognition in solving the Active Authentication (AA) problem for smartphones. We report the results of face authentication using videos recorded by the front camera. The videos were acquired while the users were performing a number of tasks under three different ambient conditions to capture the type of variations caused by the 'mobility' of the devices. An inspection of these videos reveal a combination of favorable and challenging properties unique to smartphone face videos. In addition to variations caused by the mobility of the device, other challenges in the dataset include occlusion, occasional pose changes, blur and face/fiducial points localization errors. We evaluate still image and image set-based authentication algorithms using intensity features extracted around fiducial points.

The success of the key generation depends on the channel reciprocity, which is impacted by the non-simultaneous measurements and the white nature of the noise. In this paper, an OFDM subcarriers' channel responses based key generation system with enhanced channel reciprocity is proposed. By theoretically modelling the OFDM subcarriers' channel responses, the channel reciprocity is modelled and analyzed. A low pass filter is accordingly designed to improve the channel reciprocity by suppressing the noise. This feature is essential in low SNR environments in order to reduce the risk of the failure of the information reconciliation phase during key generation. The simulation results show that the low pass filter improves the channel reciprocity, decreases the key disagreement, and effectively increases the success of the key generation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective key generation system using improved channel reciprocity","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178266","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178266.pdf","startPage":"1727","endPage":"1731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"An effective key generation system using improved channel reciprocity","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178266/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361632","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective key generation system using improved channel reciprocity","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049189S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178267,"authors":[{"name":"Lijian Zhang","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lijian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085501192"},{"name":"Liang Jin","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085451721"},{"name":"Wenyu Luo","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, China"],"firstName":"Wenyu","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085498342"},{"name":"Yanqun Tang","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanqun","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085506315"},{"name":"Dingjiu Yu","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, China"],"firstName":"Dingjiu","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085482386"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178267","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Robustness","Joints","Noise","Security","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","approximation theory","array signal processing","concave programming","convex programming","relaxation theory","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust joint cooperative beamforming","artificial noise design","amplify and forward multiantenna relay system","physical layer security","AF multi-antenna relay system","multiple eavesdropper","CB","AN","channel state information","CSI","worst-case secrecy maximization","semidefinite relaxation technique","SDR technique","S-procedure algorithm","successive convex approximation algorithm","SCA algorithm","nonconvex optimization","SDP","semidefinite program","interior method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","amplify-and-forward relaying","cooperative beamforming","artificial noise","secrecy rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178267","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178267","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"In this paper, we address physical layer security for amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-antenna relay systems in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers.

Copy-move is one of popular audio forgeries. It is very important to identify audio recording with duplicated segments. However, copy-move detection in digital audio with sample by sample comparison is invalid due to post-processing after forgeries. In this paper we present a method based on pitch similarity to detect copy-move forgeries. We use a robust pitch tracking method to extract the pitch of every syllable and calculate the similarities of these pitch sequences. Then we can use the similarities to detect copy-move forgeries of digital audio recording. Experimental result shows that our method is feasible and efficient.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Audio recording","Forgery","Robustness","Fingerprint recognition","Image segmentation","Audio databases","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio recording","counterfeit goods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copy-move detection","audio editing software","audio forgeries","post-processing","pitch tracking","pitch sequences","digital audio recording"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio forgeries","Audio forensics","Copy-Move detection","Pitch similarity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178277","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178277.pdf","startPage":"1782","endPage":"1786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Copy-move detection of audio recording with pitch similarity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Copy-move detection of audio recording with pitch similarity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178277/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178277/","accessionNumber":"15362191","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Copy-move detection of audio recording with pitch similarity","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067596S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7178280,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Port\u00ealo","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal","INESC-ID, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Port\u00ealo","id":"37085439900"},{"name":"Alberto Abad","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal","INESC-ID, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Abad","id":"37562897200"},{"name":"Bhiksha Raj","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhiksha","lastName":"Raj","id":"37274448400"},{"name":"Isabel Trancoso","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal","INESC-ID, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Isabel","lastName":"Trancoso","id":"37330179400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178280","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Quantization (signal)","Acoustics","Hamming distance","Euclidean distance","Feature extraction","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","query formulation","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy preserving speech search","query-by-example speech search","secure binary embeddings","hashing method","vector data conversion","random projections","banded quantization","spoken query search","encrypted domain","dynamic time warping","posterior derived features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Query-by-Example Speech Search","Dynamic Time Warping","Secure Binary Embeddings","Data Privacy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178280","abstract":"This paper investigates a new privacy-preserving paradigm for the task of Query-by-Example Speech Search using Secure Binary Embeddings, a hashing method that converts vector data to bit strings through a combination of random projections followed by banded quantization.

Typical machine learning approaches, which learn a classifier based on a handcrafted feature vector, are not sufficiently robust to such reorderings. We propose a different approach, which, similar to natural language modeling, learns the language of malware spoken through the executed instructions and extracts robust, time domain features. Echo state networks (ESNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used for the projection stage that extracts the features. These models are trained in an unsupervised fashion. A standard classifier uses these features to detect malicious files. We explore a few variants of ESNs and RNNs for the projection stage, including Max-Pooling and Half-Frame models which we propose. The best performing hybrid model uses an ESN for the recurrent model, Max-Pooling for non-linear sampling, and logistic regression for the final classification.

Color features have been popularly used in visual tracking. However, most conventional color-based trackers either rely on luminance information or use simple color representations for image description. During the tracking sequences, the perceived color of the target may change because of the varying lighting conditions. In this paper, we learn the color patterns offline from pixels sampled from images across different camera views. In the new color feature space, the proposed tracking method performs robustly in various environment. The new color feature space is learned by learning a linear transformation and a dictionary to encode pixel values. To speedup the feature extraction, we use the marginal regression to calculate the sparse feature codes. Experimental results demonstrate that significant improvement can be achieved by using our learned color features, especially on the video sequences with complicated lighting conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178316","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178316.pdf","startPage":"1976","endPage":"1980","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual tracking using learned color features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Visual tracking using learned color features","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178316/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362183","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178316/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual tracking using learned color features","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080466S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178319,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Hu","affiliation":["Texas A&M, Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085400600"},{"name":"Dmitri B.

While sparse coding has been proposed as an efficient strategy employed by neural systems to encode sensory stimuli, the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. Most previous approaches model the neural dynamics by the sparse representation dictionary itself and compute the representation coefficients offline. In reality, faced with the challenge of constantly changing stimuli, neurons must compute the sparse representations dynamically in an online fashion. Here, we describe a leaky linearized Bregman iteration (LLBI) algorithm which computes the time varying sparse representations using a biologically motivated network of leaky rectifying neurons. Compared to previous attempt of dynamic sparse coding, LLBI exploits the temporal correlation of stimuli and demonstrate better performance both in representation error and the smoothness of temporal evolution of sparse coefficients.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178319","startPage":"1991","endPage":"1995","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178319.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online computation of sparse representations of time varying stimuli using a biologically motivated neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178319/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Online computation of sparse representations of time varying stimuli using a biologically motivated neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178319/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15361979","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online computation of sparse representations of time varying stimuli using a biologically motivated neural network","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108528S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178320,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Marchi","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence & Signal Processing Group, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Marchi","id":"37075554100"},{"name":"Fabio Vesperini","affiliation":["A3LAB, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Vesperini","id":"37085507716"},{"name":"Florian Eyben","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence & Signal Processing Group, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Eyben","id":"37542054600"},{"name":"Stefano Squartini","affiliation":["A3LAB, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Squartini","id":"37269339100"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Schuller","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK","Chair of Complex and Intelligent Systems, University of Passau, Germany","Machine Intelligence & Signal Processing Group, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Schuller","id":"37085434217"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178320","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2531},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Hidden Markov models","Training","Feature extraction","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic acoustic novelty detection","denoising autoencoder","bidirectional LSTM neural networks","abnormal-novel acoustic signals","reference-normal data","novel unsupervised approach","auditory spectral features","long short term memory recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic Novelty Detection","Denoising Autoencorder","Bidirectional LSTM","Recurrent Neural Networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178320","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178320.pdf","startPage":"1996","endPage":"2000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for automatic acoustic novelty detection using a denoising autoencoder with bidirectional LSTM neural networks","abstract":"Acoustic novelty detection aims at identifying abnormal/novel acoustic signals which differ from the reference/normal data that the system was trained with.

Given that the expertise and experience of healthcare providers may vary significantly, an area of potential improvement is optimizing the way patient cases are recommended to clinical experts (e.g., the pathologist who is most adept at diagnosing a rare cancer). In this paper, we propose an expert selection system that automatically matches a given patient case to the best available expert considering both the available contextual information about a patient (e.g., demographics, medical history, signs and symptoms, past interventions) and the congestion of the expert. We prove that as the number of patients grows, the proposed algorithm will discover the best expert to select for patients with a specific context. Moreover, the algorithm also provides confidence bounds on the diagnostic accuracy of the expert it selects. While the proposed system can be applied in many scenarios, we demonstrate its performance in the context of assigning mammography exams to individual radiologists for interpretation. We show that our proposed system can improve current clinical practice by improving overall sensitivity and specificity of screening exams compared to random assignment.Finally, since each expert can only take a certain number of diagnosis decisions on a daily basis, we show how our system can take the experts' workload into account as well as the expertise when deciding how to select experts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178342/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361552","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven approach for matching clinical expertise to individual cases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven approach for matching clinical expertise to individual cases","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099327S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7178347,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Mroueh","affiliation":["Poggio Lab, CSAIL, MIT"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Mroueh","id":"37085346026"},{"name":"Etienne Marcheret","affiliation":["IBM T.J Watson Research Center"],"firstName":"Etienne","lastName":"Marcheret","id":"37283421400"},{"name":"Vaibhava Goel","affiliation":["International Business Machines Corp, Armonk, NY, US"],"firstName":"Vaibhava","lastName":"Goel"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178347","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1740},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Speech","Correlation","Training","Joints","Speech recognition","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","acoustic signal processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep multimodal learning","audio-visual speech recognition","fusing speech","visual modalities","audio-visual automatic speech recognition","AV-ASR","uni-modal deep networks","hidden layers","audio network","phone error rate","IBM large vocabulary audio-visual studio","IBM large vocabulary audio-visual studio dataset","fusion model","PER","visual channel","phone classification","signal-noise ratio","deep network architecture","bilinear softmax layer","bilinear networks","significant phone error rate reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (AV-ASR)","Multimodal Learning","Deep Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present methods in deep multimodal learning for fusing speech and visual modalities for Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (AV-ASR). First, we study an approach where uni-modal deep networks are trained separately and their final hidden layers fused to obtain a joint feature space in which another deep network is built. While the audio network alone achieves a phone error rate (PER) of 41% under clean condition on the IBM large vocabulary audio-visual studio dataset, this fusion model achieves a PER of 35.83% demonstrating the tremendous value of the visual channel in phone classification even in audio with high signal to noise ratio. Second, we present a new deep network architecture that uses a bilinear softmax layer to account for class specific correlations between modalities. We show that combining the posteriors from the bilinear networks with those from the fused model mentioned above results in a further significant phone error rate reduction, yielding a final PER of 34.03%.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178347.pdf","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep multimodal learning for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deep multimodal learning for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361144","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178347/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep multimodal learning for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046735S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7178348,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Uhlich","affiliation":["Sony European Technology Center (EuTEC), Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Uhlich","id":"37572669200"},{"name":"Franck Giron","affiliation":["Sony European Technology Center (EuTEC), Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Giron","id":"37085493051"},{"name":"Yuki Mitsufuji","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Audio Technology Development Department, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Mitsufuji","id":"37077233900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178348","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1057},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Multiple signal classification","Training","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","MATLAB","RNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","musical acoustics","musical instruments","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural network based instrument extraction","music","solo instrument performance","rectified linear units","output layer","least square initialization","traditional random initialization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network (DNN)","Instrument extraction","Blind source separation (BSS)"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the extraction of an instrument from music by using a deep neural network.

We take a classification-based approach, where the objective is to estimate an Ideal Binary Mask (IBM) that classifies each time-frequency (T-F) unit of the noisy observation into one of the two categories: speech-dominant unit or noise-dominant unit. The estimated mask is used to binary weight the noisy mixture to obtain the enhanced speech. In the proposed system, the sparse non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is used to extract features from the noisy observation, followed by a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classification. Compared with several existing classification-based systems, the proposed system uses minimal speech-specific domain knowledge, but is able to achieve better performance in certain low SNR regions. Moreover, the proposed system outperforms the traditional statistical method, especially in terms of improving the intelligibility.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178350","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178350.pdf","startPage":"2145","endPage":"2149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining sparse NMF with deep neural network: A new classification-based approach for speech enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Combining sparse NMF with deep neural network: A new classification-based approach for speech enhancement","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178350/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362115","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining sparse NMF with deep neural network: A new classification-based approach for speech enhancement","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086218S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7178351,"authors":[{"name":"Guoxu Zhou","affiliation":["Lab for Advanced Brain Signal Processing, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan"],"firstName":"Guoxu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37533982900"},{"name":"Andrzej Cichocki","affiliation":["Lab for Advanced Brain Signal Processing, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Cichocki","id":"37085425432"},{"name":"Danilo P.

Unlike the other existing algorithms for block sparse signal recovery which assume the cluster structure of the non-zero elements of the unknown signal to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), we use a more realistic Bernoulli-Gaussian hidden Markov model (BGHMM) to capture the burstiness (block structure) of the impulsive noise in practical applications such as Power Line Communication (PLC). The Block-IBA iteratively estimates the amplitudes and positions of the block-sparse signal based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm which is also optimized with the steepest-ascent method. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our algorithm for block-sparse signal recovery.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178356/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361600","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178356/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"An iterative bayesian algorithm for block-sparse signal reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative bayesian algorithm for block-sparse signal reconstruction","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061912S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7178358,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Papachristoudis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Papachristoudis","id":"37872052000"},{"name":"John W.

Here, we focus on Gaussian models and show that by exploiting sparsity in the measurement model, the complexity of planning is substantially reduced.

Dealing with bivariate signals using GPs require four covariance matrices, or equivalently, two complex matrices. We propose a GP-based approach for modelling complex signals, whereby the second-order statistics are learnt through maximum likelihood; in particular, the complex GP approach allows for circularity coefficient estimation in a robust manner when the observed signal is corrupted by (circular) white noise. The proposed model is validated using climate signals, for both circular and noncircular cases. The results obtained open new possibilities for collaboration between the complex signal processing and Gaussian processes communities towards an appealing representation and statistical description of bivariate signals.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178363","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178363.pdf","startPage":"2209","endPage":"2213","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of complex signals using gaussian processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of complex signals using gaussian processes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178363/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361922","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178363/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of complex signals using gaussian processes","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062014S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178387,"authors":[{"name":"Neeraj Sharma","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38469591500"},{"name":"Sai Gunaranjan Pelluri","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Sai Gunaranjan","lastName":"Pelluri","id":"37085358521"},{"name":"Thippur V.

The received signal embeds the motion attributes of the source via Doppler effect. In this paper, we analyze the Doppler effect on mixture of time-varying sinusoids. Focusing, on the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the received signal, we show that the IF profile composed of IF and its first two derivatives can be used to obtain source motion parameters. This requires a smooth estimate of IF profile. However, the numerical implementation of traditional approaches, such as analytic signal and energy separation approach, gives oscillatory behavior hence a non-smooth IF estimate. We devise an algorithm using non-uniformly spaced signal extrema samples of the received signal for smooth IF profile estimation. Using the smooth IF profiles for a source moving on a linear trajectory with constant velocity, an accurate estimate of moving source parameters is obtained. We see promise of this approach for an arbitrary trajectory motion parameter estimation.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178387","startPage":"2329","endPage":"2333","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178387.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving sound source parameter estimation using a single microphone and signal extrema samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Moving sound source parameter estimation using a single microphone and signal extrema samples","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178387/","accessionNumber":"15362008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178387/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving sound source parameter estimation using a single microphone and signal extrema samples","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075071S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178388,"authors":[{"name":"Yongzhe Li","affiliation":["Dept.

The TB-based MIMO radar enables special spatio-temporal structure and low rank of clutter covariance matrices. To efficiently mitigate the hot clutter such as terrain scattered multipath jamming concentrated in the sector-of-interest and the enhanced cold clutter due to transmit energy focusing, we resort to three-dimensional (3D) space-time adaptive processing (STAP) technique. A new 3D STAP method is proposed, which significantly reduces the computational complexity.

This is due to the fact that the sidelobe-free area in the appropriate MIMO ambiguity function is K times smaller than for a single periodic waveform, where K is the number of MIMO waveforms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aperiodicwaveforms with mismatched filtering for target detection in heavy clutter. part II - MIMO radar architecture","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178390","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178390.pdf","startPage":"2344","endPage":"2348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Aperiodicwaveforms with mismatched filtering for target detection in heavy clutter. part II - MIMO radar architecture","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178390/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361691","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aperiodicwaveforms with mismatched filtering for target detection in heavy clutter. part II - MIMO radar architecture","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072413S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178391,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC"],"firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085583753"},{"name":"Jeffrey Krolik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Krolik","id":"37271691100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178391","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Delays","MIMO","Radio frequency","Monitoring","Array signal processing","Clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical communication","indoor radio","MIMO communication","multipath channels","patient monitoring","radio spectrum management","signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-delay adaptive processing","SDAP","MIMO RF indoor motion mapping","indoor RF localization methods","ultra-wideband signals","time-delay resolution","spectrum use restrictions","linear MIMO transmit-receive arrays","near ultra-wideband range resolution","multipath sidelobe suppression","indoor motion monitoring","pressure ulcer prevention","patient repositioning activity mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","wide-area","motion monitoring","indoor multipath","bandwidth"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, space-delay adaptive processing (SDAP) is proposed for motion mapping using MIMO RF signals.

Due to spectrum use restrictions, however, there is a need for methods which can operate using the lower bandwidths allocated for so-called ISM use. In this paper, we develop SDAP methods for linear MIMO transmit-receive arrays which can achieve near ultra-wideband range resolution and multipath sidelobe suppression but which use significantly less bandwidth.

Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) plays an important role in estimating direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) and radial velocities of emitting sources. However, the detection performance is fundamentally limited by the array geometry and the temporal samplers at each sensor. Coprime arrays and coprime samplers offer an enhanced degree of freedom of O(MN) using only O(M + N) physical sensors or samples. In this paper, we propose coprime joint angle-Doppler estimation (coprime JADE), which incorporates both coprime arrays and coprime samplers with the STAP framework. Nonuniform time samples at different sensors can be used to generate a sampled autocorrelation matrix, from which we compute a spatial smoothed matrix. It will be proved that spatial smoothed matrices can be used in the MUSIC algorithm for parameter estimation.

Supporting simulation results for both sparse linear arrays and circular arrays demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of high resolution and estimation accuracy compared to the MUSIC and sparse signal reconstruction based methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178398","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178398.pdf","startPage":"2384","endPage":"2388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian compressive sensing for DOA estimation using the difference coarray","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178398/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian compressive sensing for DOA estimation using the difference coarray","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361818","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178398/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian compressive sensing for DOA estimation using the difference coarray","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.184601S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7178401,"authors":[{"name":"Si Qin","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Si","lastName":"Qin","id":"37085412781"},{"name":"Qisong Wu","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Qisong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085375680"},{"name":"Yimin D.

If the spatial distribution of the targets can be parameterized with a known model a priori, the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problems can be simplified as parameter estimation problems. However, these methods do not apply when the targets are not parameterizable. Motivated by this fact, we propose an effective approach for the DOA estimation of nonparametric spatially extended targets. In the proposed approach, the spatially extended targets are modeled as a continuous sparse structure, which are effectively estimated using the Bayesian compressive sensing techniques based on a paired spike-and-slab prior accounting for the angular target spread. In particular, the problem is examined under a collocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar platform. Signal transmission at multiple coprime transmit frequencies are also considered to achieve increased degrees-of-freedom. The group sparsity of the targets across different frequencies is exploited to achieve improved DOA estimation performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178401.pdf","startPage":"2399","endPage":"2403","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doa estimation of nonparametric spreading spatial spectrum based on bayesian compressive sensing exploiting intra-task dependency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Bayes methods","Compressed sensing","MIMO","Frequency estimation","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","compressed sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially distributed targets","spatial distribution","direction-of-arrival estimation problems","DOA estimation problems","parameter estimation problems","nonparametric spatially extended targets","continuous sparse structure","Bayesian compressive sensing techniques","paired spike-and-slab prior accounting","angular target spread","collocated multiple-input multiple-output radar platform","collocated MIMO radar platform","signal transmission","multiple coprime transmit frequencies","group sparsity","intra-task dependency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar","Bayesian compressive sensing","direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation","coprime frequency","sum coarray"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Doa estimation of nonparametric spreading spatial spectrum based on bayesian compressive sensing exploiting intra-task dependency","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362054","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doa estimation of nonparametric spreading spatial spectrum based on bayesian compressive sensing exploiting intra-task dependency","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127164S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7178407,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Cheng","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38469649200"},{"name":"Leonardo G.

Unlike a CPOFDM system, the FBMC based systems experience inter-carrier interference and inter-symbol interference especially in a highly frequency selective channel. To calculate the resulting rate region, we have to solve a joint optimization of the per-subcarrier multitap filters at the relay as well as at the users, which is nonconvex. Therefore, we resort to a two-step approach. First, we design closed-form solutions for the per-subcarrier pre-equalizers and equalizers at all nodes. Then we derive an optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the achievable rate. Simulation results show that the achievable sum rate increases as the number of taps used for pre-equalization and equalization at the subcarriers increases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178409.pdf","startPage":"2439","endPage":"2443","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint design of multi-tap filters and power control for FBMC/OQAM based two-way decode-and-forward relaying systems in highly frequency selective channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Legged locomotion","Equalizers","Periodic structures","Europe","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","filtering theory","intercarrier interference","quadrature amplitude modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitap filters","power control","FBMC/OQAM","two-way decode-and-forward relaying systems","highly frequency selective channels","CPOFDM system","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","joint optimization","persubcarrier multitap filters","optimal power allocation scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FBMC","two-way relaying","decode and forward","multi-tap filters","power allocation","convex optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint design of multi-tap filters and power control for FBMC/OQAM based two-way decode-and-forward relaying systems in highly frequency selective channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178409/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361665","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint design of multi-tap filters and power control for FBMC/OQAM based two-way decode-and-forward relaying systems in highly frequency selective channels","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049307S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178410,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["ECE Department, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"37085390804"},{"name":"Athina Petropulu","affiliation":["ECE Department, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ"],"firstName":"Athina","lastName":"Petropulu","id":"37284953400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178410","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":382},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","cooperative communication","covariance matrices","interference suppression","MIMO communication","MIMO radar","radar interference","radar receivers","radio spectrum management","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-MC radar communication system","spectrum sharing","matrix completion","multiple input multiple output radar","radar sparse sampling","radar fusion center","power saving","bandwidth saving","transmit covariance matrix","effective interference power","radar receiver","cooperative approach","noncooperative approach","EIP reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collocated MIMO radar","matrix completion","spectrum sharing"]}],"abstract":"Recently proposed multiple input multiple output radars based on matrix completion (MIMO-MC) employ sparse sampling to reduce the amount of data forwarded to the radar fusion center, and as such enable savings in communication power and bandwidth.

Exploiting redundancies along the spatial and spectral dimensions of a hyperspectral image of a scene has created new paradigms that do away with the limitations of traditional imaging systems. While Compressive Sensing (CS) approaches have been proposed and simulated with success on already acquired hyperspectral imagery, most of the existing work relies on the capability to simultaneously measure the spatial and spectral dimensions of the hyperspectral cube. Most real-life devices, however, are limited to sampling one or two dimensions at a time, which renders a significant portion of the existing work unfeasible. In this paper we propose a novel CS framework that is a hybrid between traditional vectorized approaches and recently proposed tensorial approaches, and that is compatible with real-life devices both in terms of the acquisition and reconstruction requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178412.pdf","startPage":"2454","endPage":"2458","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid vectorial and tensorial Compressive Sensing for hyperspectral imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Hyperspectral imaging","Tensile stress","Compressed sensing","Discrete cosine transforms","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","hyperspectral imaging","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid vectorial-tensorial compressive sensing","hyperspectral imaging","hyperspectral imager cost","spectral dimensions","paradigms","hyperspectral imagery","spatial dimensions","hyperspectral cube","real-life devices","tensorial approaches","reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","hyperspectral imaging","high-order tensorial data representation","multilinear algebra"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid vectorial and tensorial Compressive Sensing for hyperspectral imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178412/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15346640","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid vectorial and tensorial Compressive Sensing for hyperspectral imaging","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084639S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178416,"authors":[{"name":"Foroohar Foroozan","affiliation":["InnoMind Technology, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Foroohar","lastName":"Foroozan","id":"37284434500"},{"name":"Parastoo Sadeghi","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Parastoo","lastName":"Sadeghi","id":"37270112600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178416","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"abstract":"The paper investigates combining Compressive Sensing (CS) with the robust Capon beamformer (RCB) for the purpose of medical ultrasound image formation with a much reduced number of samples compared to those used in current state-of-art ultrasound.

For planewave signals measured with a ULA, the locations of the ensemble MVDR polynomial zeros are constrained on the unit circle.

Existing designs are usually completed at the stage of achieving an optimal transmit covariance matrix from identifying a weighting matrix with the assumption of ideally orthogonal waveforms. However, we propose a compensation technique to achieve the optimal covariance matrix without the requirement of orthogonality. The corresponding solutions identify a set of weighting matrices that are robust against the imperfection of the waveforms. As a result, a set of easy-to-generate partially correlated linear frequency modulated (LFM) waveforms can be used to achieve identical transmit beampatterns which could be synthesized by ideally orthogonal multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar waveforms. The proposed robust design is evaluated via numerical examples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178422","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178422.pdf","startPage":"2504","endPage":"2508","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust transmit beampattern design for uniform linear arrays using correlated LFM waveforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust transmit beampattern design for uniform linear arrays using correlated LFM waveforms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178422/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362049","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178422/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust transmit beampattern design for uniform linear arrays using correlated LFM waveforms","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048869S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7178423,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefui, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085374846"},{"name":"Lei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefui, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085345280"},{"name":"Long Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefui, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085544469"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefui, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085539713"},{"name":"Zhongfu Ye","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Speech and Language Information Processing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongfu","lastName":"Ye","id":"37287656600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178423","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Signal to noise ratio","Arrays","Interference","Array signal processing","Covariance matrices","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna array geometry","interference-plus-noise subspace projection matrix","ESV","extended steering vector","SOI","signal of interest","noncircularity rate","received signals","MVDR beamformer","optimal widely linear minimum variance distortionless response beamformer","noncircular signals","projection constraint","robust widely linear beamformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","widely linear","projection matrix","robust widely linear beamformer"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust widely linear beamformer based on a projection constraint","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","endPage":"2513","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178423","startPage":"2509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178423","abstract":"For noncircular signals, optimal widely linear (WL) minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer has a powerful performance by exploiting the noncircularity of the received signals.

This paper introduces a new robust WL beamformer. In the proposed approach, the assumed extended steering vector (ESV) of the SOI is used to construct an interference-plus-noise subspace projection matrix, and the new ESV is estimated by maximizing the WL beamformer output power under a constraint that prevents the ESV from converging to the interference. The proposed algorithm only needs imprecise knowledge of the antenna array geometry and the SOI's angular sector. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361762","htmlLink":"/document/7178423/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust widely linear beamformer based on a projection constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust widely linear beamformer based on a projection constraint","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055158S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178424,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38542811500"},{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085426704"},{"name":"Ning Ge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Ge","id":"37337989900"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178424","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Uncertainty","Programming","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","mathematical programming","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust minimum variance beamforming","distributional uncertainty","first-order moment uncertainty","probability measure constraint","first-order moment constraint","modified distortionless response constraint","semidefinite program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum variance beamforming","distributionally robust optimization","strong duality","semidefinite programming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178424","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178424","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"This paper investigates distributionally robust minimum variance beamforming under first-order moment uncertainty. In contrast to deterministic modeling of the array response, our approach employs a distributional set to describe the uncertainty. The distributional set we introduce consists of two constraints: the probability measure constraint and a first-order moment constraint. The weights are selected to minimize the combined output power, subject to the modified distortionless response constraint that the expected real part of the array gain exceeds unity for all distributions in the uncertainty set. We begin our discussion by revealing the intrinsic connection between the distributionally robust minimum variance beamformers (DRMVB) and the robust minimum variance beamformer (RMVB). Then for the sample space described by a union of ellipsoids, the DRMVB is reformulated as the optimal solution of a semidefinite program (SDP). Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the DRMVB via several numerical examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","startPage":"2514","endPage":"2518","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178424.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust minimum variance beamforming under distributional uncertainty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178424/","displayDocTitle":"Robust minimum variance beamforming under distributional uncertainty","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361761","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust minimum variance beamforming under distributional uncertainty","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048278S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178425,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Simakov","affiliation":["Maritime Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Edinburgh, Australia"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Simakov","id":"37662979100"},{"name":"Zhi Yong Zhang","affiliation":["Maritime Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Edinburgh, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhi Yong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085475751"},{"name":"Robert P.

In this context, it is interesting to use an adaptive version of the Low Rank Normalized Matched Filter (LR-ANMF) detector, which is a function of the estimated projector onto the low rank noise subspace. We will show that the traditional approximation of the LR-ANMF detector distribution is not always the better one. In this paper, we propose to perform its limits when the number of secondary data K and the data dimension m both tend to infinity at the same rate m/K \u2192 c\u22082 (0;\u221e). Then, we give the theoretical distributions of these limits in the large dimensional regime and approximate the LR-ANMF detector distribution by them. The comparison of empirical and theoretical distributions on a jamming application shows the interest of our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178441/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178441/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15346651","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic performance of the Low Rank Adaptive Normalized Matched Filter in a large dimensional regime","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic performance of the Low Rank Adaptive Normalized Matched Filter in a large dimensional regime","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070533S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178453,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Mohammad Tavakoli","affiliation":["Audio Analysis Lab, AD: MT Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Vincent Mohammad","lastName":"Tavakoli","id":"37085440436"},{"name":"Jesper Rindom Jensen","affiliation":["Audio Analysis Lab, AD: MT Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper Rindom","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37271733000"},{"name":"Mads Gr\u00e6sb\u00f8ll Christenseny","affiliation":["Audio Analysis Lab, AD: MT Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Mads Gr\u00e6sb\u00f8ll","lastName":"Christenseny","id":"37560629200"},{"name":"Jacob Benesty","affiliation":["INRS-EMT University of Quebec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Benesty","id":"37085340531"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178453","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphone arrays","Indexes","Estimation","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","filtering theory","microphone arrays","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel pseudocoherence","minimum variance distortionless response filtering","ad hoc microphone arrays","speech enhancement","peudocoherence based MVDR beamformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise reduction","speech enhancement","distributed microphone array","STFT domain","MVDR filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178453","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178453","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"Speech enhancement with distributed arrays has been met with various methods.

The associated beamformer design problem has drawn considerable attention over the last decade, but existing solutions are not quite satisfactory. The core problem is NP-hard, and the available approximations leave much to be desired in terms of achieving favorable performance-complexity trade-offs, especially for online implementation. This paper introduces a new class of adaptive multicast beamforming algorithms that simultaneously cover all bases - featuring guaranteed convergence and state-of-art performance at low complexity. Each update takes a step in the direction of an inverse Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) weighted linear combination of the SNR-gradient vectors of all users. Convergence is established by recourse to proportional fairness. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) and Successive Linear Approximation (SLA - the prior state-of-art) at an order of magnitude lower complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361584","htmlLink":"/document/7178465/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multicast beamforming: Guaranteed convergence and state-of-art performance at low complexity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multicast beamforming: Guaranteed convergence and state-of-art performance at low complexity","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060124S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178466,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zlem Tu\u011ffe Demir","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, METU, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00d6zlem Tu\u011ffe","lastName":"Demir","id":"37062071800"},{"name":"T.

The transmit antennas transmit correlated waveforms to illuminate certain directions. Each receive antenna performs sub-Nyquist sampling of the target returns at uniformly random times, and forwards the samples to a fusion center along with information on the sampling times. Based on the forwarded samples, the fusion center partially fills a matrix, recovers the Nyquist rate samples via matrix completion, and subsequently proceeds with target estimation via standard techniques. The performance of matrix completion depends on the matrix coherence. The paper derives the relations between transmit waveforms and matrix coherence. Specifically, it is shown that, for a rank-1 beamformer, the coherence is optimal, i.e., 1, if and only if the waveforms are unimodular. For a multi-rank beamformer, the coherence of the row space of the data matrix is optimal if the waveform power is constant across each snapshot. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves high resolution with a significantly reduced number of samples.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178476.pdf","startPage":"2774","endPage":"2778","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On transmit beamforming in MIMO radar with matrix completion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coherence","Array signal processing","MIMO radar","Directive antennas","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","coherence","matrix algebra","MIMO radar","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix completion based colocated MIMO radar","MIMO-MC","transmit beamforming","transmit antennas","correlated waveforms","receive antenna","sub-Nyquist sampling","fusion center","sampling times","Nyquist rate samples","target estimation","matrix coherence","transmit waveforms","rank-1 beamformer","multi-rank beamformer","data matrix","waveform power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","matrix completion","transmit beamforming","coherence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"On transmit beamforming in MIMO radar with matrix completion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178476/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362003","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On transmit beamforming in MIMO radar with matrix completion","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067082S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178477,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

However, data acquired from multiple passes require precise registration of the flight tracks, which is often not possible, particularly for small airborne platforms. This study analyses the potential for SAR imaging of the ground under a forest canopy using data from a single pass of a multichannel across-track radar system. We focus in particular on the case of a two-channel alternating-transmit interferometer giving three effective input channels. 3D image formation in one pass by phase-preserving adaptive beamforming is shown to provide sufficient attenuation of the interference from a model forest volume to permit a reasonable estimation of the ground coherence across two passes for coherent change detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178477/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15361708","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178477/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"3D SAR beamforming under a foliage canopy from a single pass","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D SAR beamforming under a foliage canopy from a single pass","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002779.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060603S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178478,"authors":[{"name":"Roi M\u00e9ndez-Rial","affiliation":["Universidade de Vigo, Vigo, Galicia, ES"],"firstName":"Roi","lastName":"M\u00e9ndez-Rial"},{"name":"Nuria Gonz\u00e1lez-Prelcic","affiliation":["Universidade de Vigo"],"firstName":"Nuria","lastName":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Prelcic","id":"38314617900"},{"name":"Robert W.

However, this does not always hold true since the noise is nonuniform in certain applications and a model of arbitrary diagonal noise covariance matrix should be adopted. To this end, a simple approach to handling the unknown nonuniform noise problem is proposed. In particular, an iterative procedure is developed to determine the signal subspace and noise covariance matrix. As a consequence, existing subspace-based DOA estimators such as MUSIC can be applied. Furthermore, the proposed method converges within very few iterations, in each of which closed-form estimates of the signal subspace and noise covariance matrix can be achieved. Hence, it is much more computationally attractive than conventional methods which rely on multi-dimensional search. It is shown that the proposed method enjoys good performance, simplicity and low computational cost, which are desirable in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178479","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","startPage":"2789","endPage":"2793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple method for DOA estimation in the presence of unknown nonuniform noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simple method for DOA estimation in the presence of unknown nonuniform noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178479/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362090","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178479/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple method for DOA estimation in the presence of unknown nonuniform noise","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065773S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178482,"authors":[{"name":"Wenmeng Xiong","affiliation":["Lss, CentraleSupelec, GIF-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Wenmeng","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37085506509"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Picheral","affiliation":["Lss, CentraleSupelec, GIF-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Picheral","id":"37294369500"},{"name":"Sylvie Marcos","affiliation":["Lss, CentraleSupelec, GIF-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Sylvie","lastName":"Marcos","id":"37285022400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178482","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"abstract":"In this paper, the direction of arrival (DOA) localization of spatially distributed sources impinging on a sensor array is considered.

In this paper, we present the C-NC Standard ESPRIT and the C-NC Unitary ESPRIT algorithms designed for the more practical scenario of a received mixture of circular and strictly non-circular signals. Assuming that the number of circular and strictly non-circular signals is known, the two proposed methods yield closed-form estimates and C-NC Unitary ESPRIT also enables an entirely real-valued implementation. As a main result, it is shown that the estimation accuracy of the presented algorithms improves with an increasing number of strictly non-circular signals among a fixed number of sources. Thereby, not only the estimation accuracy of the strictly non-circular signals themselves is improved, but also the estimation accuracy of the circular signals.

Traditional signal processing methods such as the classic least square (LS) method rely on strong assumptions on signal models and accurate estimations of time delay of arrival (TDOA) . They only work well in relatively clean conditions, but suffer from noise and reverberation distortions. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach that can learn from a large amount of simulated noisy and reverberant microphone array inputs for robust DOA estimation. Specifically, we extract features from the generalised cross correlation (GCC) vectors and use a multilayer perceptron neural network to learn the nonlinear mapping from such features to the DOA. One advantage of the learning based method is that as more and more training data becomes available, the DOA estimation will become more and more accurate. Experimental results on simulated data show that the proposed learning based method produces much better results than the state-of-the-art LS method. The testing results on real data recorded in meeting rooms show improved root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared to the LS method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178484.pdf","startPage":"2814","endPage":"2818","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A learning-based approach to direction of arrival estimation in noisy and reverberant environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Training data","Arrays","Speech","Robustness","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","microphone arrays","multilayer perceptrons","reverberation","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning-based approach","direction of arrival estimation","reverberant microphone array","robust DOA estimation","generalised cross correlation vectors","feature extraction","multilayer perceptron neural network","nonlinear mapping","GCC","reverberant environment","noisy environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microphone arrays","direction of arrival","least squares","machine learning","neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"A learning-based approach to direction of arrival estimation in noisy and reverberant environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178484/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A learning-based approach to direction of arrival estimation in noisy and reverberant environments","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067245S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7178498,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Schad","affiliation":["ATLAS ELEKTRONIK GmbH, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Schad","id":"37645329400"},{"name":"Samer J.

In our differential scheme, receive and transmit beamforming at the RS is performed based on the implicit CSI contained in the received signals in the preceding time slots. Thus, the DBF scheme is applicable even if the communication channels are time-variant. For time-invariant channels, we show that our DBF scheme is associated with a performance penalty of 3 dB as compared to the ideal amplify-and-forward relaying scheme, which requires perfect CSI. Our simulation results confirm the analytical results for time-invariant channels. For time-variant channels, the simulation demonstrate a high performance gain of the DBF scheme compared to schemes of the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361611","htmlLink":"/document/7178498/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bi-directional differential beamforming for multi-antenna relaying","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-directional differential beamforming for multi-antenna relaying","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087387S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178503,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Alkhateeb","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Alkhateeb","id":"37085375383"},{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"},{"name":"Robert W.

Adopting the achievable sum-rate as a performance metric, we show how many compressed sensing measurements are needed to approach the perfect channel knowledge performance. The results illustrate that the proposed algorithm requires an order of magnitude less training overhead compared with traditional lower-frequency solutions, while employing mmWave-suitable hardware.

The key idea is to vary the radiation pattern at the symbol rate by selecting one from a subset of patterns with a similar main lobe and different side lobes. This paper shows that ASM is not robust to an eavesdropper that makes multiple simultaneous measurements at multiple angles. The measurements are combined and used to formulate an estimation problem to undo the effects of the side lobe randomization. Simulations show the performance of the estimation algorithms and how the eavesdropper can effectively recover the information if the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a certain threshold. Using fewer active radio frequency chains makes it harder for the attacker to recover the transmit symbol, at the expense of more grating lobes.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178504","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178504.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","startPage":"2914","endPage":"2918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An attack on antenna subset modulation for millimeter wave communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An attack on antenna subset modulation for millimeter wave communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178504/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361698","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178504/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An attack on antenna subset modulation for millimeter wave communication","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058512S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178505,"authors":[{"name":"Hien Quoc Ngo","affiliation":["Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE"],"firstName":"Hien Quoc","lastName":"Ngo","id":"38231185300"},{"name":"Erik G.

In traditional MIMO systems, full digital beamforming is done at the baseband; one distinct radio-frequency (RF) chain is required for each antenna, which for large-scale MIMO systems can be prohibitive from either cost or power consumption point of view. This paper considers a two-stage hybrid beamforming structure to reduce the number of RF chains for large-scale MIMO systems. The overall beamforming matrix consists of analog RF beamforming implemented using phase shifters and baseband digital beamforming of much smaller dimension. This paper considers precoder and receiver design for maximizing the spectral efficiency when the hybrid structure is used at both the transmitter and the receiver. On the theoretical front, bounds on the minimum number of transmit and receive RF chains that are required to realize the theoretical capacity of the large-scale MIMO system are presented. It is shown that the hybrid structure can achieve the same performance as the fully-digital beamforming scheme if the number of RF chains at each end is greater than or equal to twice the number of data streams. On the practical design front, this paper proposes a heuristic hybrid beamforming design strategy for the critical case where the number of RF chains is equal to the number of data streams, and shows that the performance of the proposed hybrid beamforming design can achieve spectral efficiency close to that of the fully-digital solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178507.pdf","startPage":"2929","endPage":"2933","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid digital and analog beamforming design for large-scale MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Array signal processing","MIMO","Receivers","Algorithm design and analysis","Transmitters","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO communication","precoding","radio links","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog beamforming design","hybrid digital beamforming design","large-scale MIMO systems","large-scale multiple-input multiple-output systems","antenna arrays","wireless communication link","distinct radio frequency","RF chain","power consumption","hybrid beamforming structure","beamforming matrix","digital beamforming","receiver design","precoder design","spectral efficiency","hybrid structure","transmitter","data streams"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid digital and analog beamforming design for large-scale MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178507/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361359","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid digital and analog beamforming design for large-scale MIMO systems","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056303S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178508,"authors":[{"name":"Xiyuan Wang","affiliation":["Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiqutcous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, P.

In contrast with the approximated block diagonalization (ABD) prebeamformer which is derived by heuristic method in the original JSDM scheme and is restricted to semi-unitary matrix, general prebeamforming matrix together with group power is optimized in the framework of per-user ergodic rate balancing. Thus, both flexibility and optimality are integrated in our work. To ease the difficulty in optimizing the exact ergodic rate, the deterministic approximation is employed. Based on the uplink-downlink duality approach, an iterative algorithm alternatively updating group power and prebeamformers is designed. It is shown that the optimization subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently. Compared with the classic signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) balancing algorithm for MISO downlink, the proposed algorithm has similar properties of both convergence and optimality. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178508","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178508.pdf","startPage":"2934","endPage":"2938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint group power allocation and prebeamforming for joint spatial-division multiplexing in multiuser massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178508/","displayDocTitle":"Joint group power allocation and prebeamforming for joint spatial-division multiplexing in multiuser massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361630","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178508/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint group power allocation and prebeamforming for joint spatial-division multiplexing in multiuser massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076215S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178509,"authors":[{"name":"Licai Fang","affiliation":["School of EECE, The University of Western Australia, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Licai","lastName":"Fang","id":"37071296800"},{"name":"Lu Xu","affiliation":["School of EECE, The University of Western Australia, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37071604300"},{"name":"Qinghua Guo","affiliation":["School of EECE, The University of Western Australia, WA, Australia","School of ECTE, The University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37273105900"},{"name":"Defeng Huang","affiliation":["School of EECE, The University of Western Australia, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Defeng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085396802"},{"name":"Sven Nordholm","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Curtin University, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Nordholm","id":"37274680800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178509","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Silicon","Modulation","Decoding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","feedback","Gaussian processes","Hermitian matrices","interference suppression","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum mean square error parallel interference cancellation","iterative soft-decision feedback MMSE-PIC detection algorithm","soft-input soft-output detector","SISO detector","bit error rate","BER","Gaussian model","Hermitian matrix inversion","massive MIMO up-link applications","transmit antennas","receive antennas","base station","self-iteration method"]}],"abstract":"In MIMO applications, the minimum mean square error parallel interference cancellation (MMSE-PIC) based Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) detector has been widely adopted because of its low complexity and good bit error rate (BER) performance.

The objective is to infer the values of all nodes from that of a minimum subset of nodes by exploiting correlations in node values. We first introduce the concept of information dominating set (IDS). A subset of nodes in a given graph is an IDS if the value of these nodes is sufficient to infer the information state of the entire graph. We focus on two fundamental algorithmic problems: (i) how to determine whether a given subset of vertices is an IDS; (ii) how to construct a minimum IDS. Assuming binary node values and the local majority rule, we show that the first problem is co-NP-complete and the second problem is NP-hard in a general network. We then show that in acyclic graphs, both problems admit linear-complexity solutions by establishing a connection between the IDS problems and the vertex cover problem. For general graphs, we develop algorithms for solving both problems based on the concept of essential differential set. These results find applications in opinion sampling such as political polling and market survey in social-economic networks, and inferring epidemics and cascading failures in communication and infrastructure networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178512","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178512.pdf","startPage":"2954","endPage":"2958","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum information dominating set for critical sampling over graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Minimum information dominating set for critical sampling over graphs","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361869","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum information dominating set for critical sampling over graphs","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062163S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178518,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Krebs","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Methoden der Signalverarbeitung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Krebs","id":"37584327400"},{"name":"Michael Joham","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Methoden der Signalverarbeitung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Joham","id":"37085352524"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Methoden der Signalverarbeitung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37085358577"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178518","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receivers","Decoding","Detectors","Silicon carbide","Complexity theory","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparative performance evaluation","error regularized Turbo-MIMO MMSE-SIC detectors","Gaussian channels","successive interference cancellation","SIC detection algorithms","maximum a-posteriori probability","MAP detection","linear filter detection","turbo multiple-input multiple-output system","Turbo-MIMO system","SIC soft detection algorithms","iterative receivers","channel decoder","Turbo-MIMO design","LTE compliant Turbo-MIMO receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Turbo-MIMO","SIC","detection","error propagation","regularization"]}],"abstract":"We evaluate the performance of a set of low complexity successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection algorithms in comparison to optimal maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) detection and low complexity linear filter detection in a Turbo multiple-input multiple-output (Turbo-MIMO) system.

Much work in the last decade has gone into proper construction of LDPC codes with maximum girth and optimized stopping sets; to ensure the BER approaches channel capacity. When an edge alteration to the graph is proposed, it completely changes the performance of the graph and usually leads to the re-analysis of the entire graph's properties. In this work we propose a method of lowering the error floor experienced in an LDPC code by intelligently inserting a set of known bits in the message frame. This deactivates paths in the graph located around trapping sets without modification of edges in the graph, and provides high log-likelihood information to the induced sub-graph for improved performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178520","startPage":"2994","endPage":"2998","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178520.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing LDPC code performance using pilot bits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178520/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing LDPC code performance using pilot bits","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361852","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178520/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing LDPC code performance using pilot bits","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0002994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078994S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7178521,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Garcia-Rodriguez","affiliation":["University College London (UCL), London, UK"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Garcia-Rodriguez","id":"37085430266"},{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["University College London (UCL), London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Masouros","id":"37299872300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178521","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","MIMO","Antennas","Detectors","Modulation","Bit error rate","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","MIMO communication","modulation","multi-access systems","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity compressive sensing detection","multi-user spatial modulation systems","low-complexity detection scheme","large-scale multiple access channel","linear detectors","signal processing complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial modulation","large-scale MIMO","multiple access","compressive sensing"]}],"abstract":"In this work we present a low-complexity detection scheme for spatial modulation (SM) systems in the large-scale multiple access channel (MAC).

However, gear-shift techniques combine multiple decoding algorithms, update rules and quantization of the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), allowing wider design space explorations as more parameters can be fine-tuned to a particular need. Gear-shift LDPC decoders have been shown to improve both the decoding throughput and the energy efficiency per bit decoded, while achieving similar capacity compared to traditional approaches that only use one algorithm. In this paper, we incorporate gear-shift techniques based on the Min-Sum algorithm (MSA) and Self-Corrected Min-Sum algorithm(SCMSA) using variable quantization steps. The proposed design allows bit error rate (BER) performances close to the more powerful SCMSA running only a selected number of iterations using the most powerful update rule.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating and deceleratingmin-sum-based gear-shift LDPC decoders","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178522","startPage":"3004","endPage":"3008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178522.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating and deceleratingmin-sum-based gear-shift LDPC decoders","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178522/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361435","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating and deceleratingmin-sum-based gear-shift LDPC decoders","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073398S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178524,"authors":[{"name":"Zhechen Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Brunl University London, Uxbridge, Middlesex, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Zhechen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37966491200"},{"name":"Asoke K.

Attentive to the property that the ICI is mainly contributed by the adjacent subcarriers in UWA channels, in this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity frequency-domain equalizer to combat the ICI for OFDM UWA communications. Specifically, the coefficients of the equalizer are obtained by using the nor- malized gradient algorithm which is based on the minimum symbol error rate (MSER) criterion.

The problem is to find a joint channel and power allocation strategy to minimize the total transmission power subject to quality of service constraints and the OFDMA constraint (i.e, at most one user is allowed to access each channel). Since the problem is generally NP-hard, the idea of the existing algorithms is to heuristically allocate the channel and power resources separately. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative reweighted minimization framework based on an effective relaxation, which is beneficial by reformulating the combinatorial OFDMA constraint as an equivalent continuous optimization problem. The proposed framework simultaneously allocates the channel and power resources, and thus is sharply different from the existing ones. Simulation results show the proposed iterative reweighted minimization methods significantly outperform the existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178535","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178535.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","startPage":"3068","endPage":"3072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative reweighted minimization framework for joint channel and power allocation in the OFDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An iterative reweighted minimization framework for joint channel and power allocation in the OFDMA system","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178535/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361440","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178535/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative reweighted minimization framework for joint channel and power allocation in the OFDMA system","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054481S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178536,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Medra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Medra","id":"37063093300"},{"name":"Timothy N.

In the scheme developed herein, the equivalent channel model is structured to be decomposable, and the linear precoders at the base stations are designed to be decomposable as well. The proposed scheme is based the principles of fractional spatial reuse precoding. Spatial reuse precoding (SRP) is a precoding scheme that exploits the fact that interfering sources that employ the same structured precoder arrive in the same subspace, regardless of the particular channel matrices between the interfering sources and the receiver. The proposed scheme is fractional in the sense that each cell is partitioned and different precoders, with different power levels, are assigned in each partition. The proposed fractional SRP scheme enables the elimination of the dominant sources of interference without requiring cooperation between base stations.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178536","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178536.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","startPage":"3073","endPage":"3077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional spatial reuse precoding for MIMO downlink networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fractional spatial reuse precoding for MIMO downlink networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178536/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361138","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178536/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional spatial reuse precoding for MIMO downlink networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07733S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178537,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Most of the studies in the literature are under total power constraints. However, the per-antenna power constraints (PAPC) are more realistic. The state-of-the-art method is interior point method which is expensive to realize in practice due to the high computational complexity. Hence, a low complexity zero-forcing precoding scheme under the per-antenna power constraints is proposed in this paper. This is achieved by introducing a regularized dual method. Simulations are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which has a low computational complexity. In addition, the algorithm can be implemented in parallel to further reduce the computational complexity.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178537.pdf","startPage":"3078","endPage":"3082","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178537","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178537","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178537","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational complexity","Australia","Array signal processing","Convergence","MIMO","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","computational complexity","MIMO communication","optimisation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity optimization algorithm","zero-forcing precoding","per-antenna power constraint","ZFBF","MIMO system","zero-forcing beamforming","PAPC","computational complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF)","per-antenna power constraint (PAPC)","dual method","parallel computation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178537/","displayDocTitle":"A low complexity optimization algorithm for zero-forcing precoding under per-antenna power constraints","accessionNumber":"15362038","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178537/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low complexity optimization algorithm for zero-forcing precoding under per-antenna power constraints","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060816S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178538,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Gharanjik","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, University of Luxembourg","KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Gharanjik","id":"37703783300"},{"name":"M.R.

Specifically, we study the amplify-and-forward (AF) schemes in C-RNs. In our scenario setting, with the cloud processor units fully coordinating in the network, the C-RN can be treated as an MIMO relay system. We therefore propose the beamformed (BF) Alamouti AF scheme to provide multigroup multicast information delivery in this network. By applying an Alamouti space-time code structure, the relays adopt two rank-one weights to AF the received signals in two time slots. Then, one more degree of freedom is available compared to the traditional BF AF scheme, and a new fractional semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is obtained from a max-min-fair quality-of-service (QoS) perspective. We prove that the Gaussian randomization algorithm based on the new fractional SDR has the same approximation quality-i.e., on the order of \u221aM-as the traditional rank-two SDR approximation in multigroup multicast networks without relays, where M is the number of users served in the network. This result is verified by our numerical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178539","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178539.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178539","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","startPage":"3088","endPage":"3092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A beamformed alamouti amplify-and-forward scheme in multigroup multicast cloud-relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"A beamformed alamouti amplify-and-forward scheme in multigroup multicast cloud-relay networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178539/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178539/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361502","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A beamformed alamouti amplify-and-forward scheme in multigroup multicast cloud-relay networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06488S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178544,"authors":[{"name":"Shuichi Ohno","affiliation":["Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Shuichi","lastName":"Ohno","id":"37085593266"},{"name":"Yuji Wakasa","affiliation":["Yamaguchi University, Ube, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Wakasa","id":"37279872600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178544","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Receiving antennas","Noise","Feeds","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","mathematical programming","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust beamformer","artificial noises","MISO wiretap channels","multiple eavesdroppers","deterministic channel uncertainties","semidefinite program","transmit power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical-layer secrecy","beamforming","artificial noise","eavesdropping","MISOME"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust beamformer and artificial noises for MISO wiretap channels with multiple eavesdroppers","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","endPage":"3117","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178544","startPage":"3113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178544","abstract":"We consider MISO wiretap channels with multiple eavesdroppers.

However, it is challenging to achieve perfect synchronization between superimposed signals at the relay. In this paper, we propose an approach to resolve the issue of frame-misalignment in PNC using type-I Euclidean geometry low-density parity-check (EG-LDPC) codes with cyclic prefix or zero padding. To estimate the arrival delay between two transmitted signals at the relay, Gold sequences are adopted as pilot sequences in our transmit frames. Simulation results show that our approach can effectively resolve the frame-misalignment issue in PNC.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178546","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","startPage":"3123","endPage":"3127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178546.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Decoding","Gold","Network coding","Delays","Signal resolution","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","Gold codes","network coding","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame-misalignment","physical-layer network coding","superimposed signals","relays","wireless communications systems","synchronization","type-I Euclidean geometry low-density parity-check codes","transmitted signals","Gold sequences","pilot sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PNC","cyclic prefix","zero padding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Approach to frame-misalignment in physical-layer network coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178546/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178546/","accessionNumber":"15346619","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approach to frame-misalignment in physical-layer network coding","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053342S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178549,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085360545"},{"name":"Wenhao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenhao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085364995"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178549","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Parity check codes","Diversity reception","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Bit error rate","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","diversity reception","radio receivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity combining","wireless relay networks","partial channel state information","diversity combiner","relay-to-destination channel","relay diversity","second-order cone programming","SOCP receiver","source nodes","relay nodes","maximum-ratio combiner"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity combiner","relay network","second-order cone programming","partial channel information"]}],"abstract":"We develop a novel diversity combiner for joint reception in wireless relay networks with unknown relay-to-destination channel.

The source has no embedded power supply, and thus, has to harvest RF energy from the AP in the downlink before transmitting its information to the AP in the uplink. The PBs are deployed to help the AP charge the source in the downlink. However, in practice, the AP and PBs may belong to different operators. Thus, incentives are needed for the PBs to assist the AP during DL energy transfer phase, which is referred to as \u201cenergy trading\u201d. We formulate this energy trading process as a Stackelberg game, in which the AP is a leader and the PBs are the followers. We then derive the Stackelberg equilibrium of the formulated game. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can achieve better performance as either the number of the PBs or the value of the gain per unit throughput increase, and as the distance between source and PBs decreases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178557/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15361580","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178557/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A stackelberg game-based energy trading scheme for power beacon-assisted wireless-powered communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stackelberg game-based energy trading scheme for power beacon-assisted wireless-powered communication","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067217S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178558,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad R.

The MRC-WPT system with a single pair of transmitter and receiver has been extensively studied in the literature, while there is limited work on the general setup with multiple transmitters and/or receivers. In this paper, we consider a point-to-multipoint MRC-WPT system with one transmitter sending power wirelessly to a set of distributed receivers simultaneously. We derive the power delivered to the load of each receiver in closed-form expression, and reveal a \u201cnear-far\u201d fairness issue in multiuser power transmission due to users' distance-dependent mutual inductances with the transmitter. We also show that by designing the receivers' load resistances, the near-far issue can be optimally solved. Specifically, we propose a centralized algorithm to jointly optimize the load resistances to minimize the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter under given power requirements for the loads. We also devise a distributed algorithm for the receivers to adjust their load resistances iteratively, for ease of practical implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178558/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15361721","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178558/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser charging control in wireless power transfer via magnetic resonant coupling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser charging control in wireless power transfer via magnetic resonant coupling","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079781S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178559,"authors":[{"name":"Ay\u00e7a \u00d6z\u00e7elikkale","affiliation":["Dept. of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ay\u00e7a","lastName":"\u00d6z\u00e7elikkale","id":"37392986200"},{"name":"Tomas McKelvey","affiliation":["Dept. of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"McKelvey","id":"37284924300"},{"name":"Mats Viberg","affiliation":["Dept. of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Viberg","id":"37065589500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178559","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Logic gates","Fading","Robustness","Transmitters","Relays","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","convex programming","electromagnetic wave scattering","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","minimisation","precoding","radio receivers","Rician channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous wireless information-and-power transfer","SWIPT capabilities","MIMO channel model","stochastic Rician fading framework","robust precoder designs","multiple-input multiple-output channel model","average mean-square error minimization","information receiver","energy receiver","channel mean","robust estimation filters","nonconvex formulations","convex relaxation","alternating minimization method","transmit antennas","scattering component","performance gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless power transfer","robust precoder design","fading"]}],"abstract":"Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) offers an attractive alternative to the traditional battery limited or grid dependent communication system design. In this paper, we investigate robust precoder designs for systems with SWIPT capabilities under a stochastic Rician fading framework. Under a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model, we formulate the problem of minimizing the average mean-square error at the information receiver (IR) while keeping the average energy harvested at the energy receiver (ER) above given levels. We consider two different strategies that can be adopted by the IR: i) simple estimation filters based solely on the channel mean, ii) robust estimation filters aiming to minimize the average mean-square error. Both of these scenarios lead to non-convex formulations. For the first scenario, we propose a convex relaxation that is tight. For the second scenario, we propose an alternating minimization method that provides precoder designs even in the scenarios where the number of transmit antennas is larger than the length of data vector. Our numerical results show that the proposed designs provide significant performance gains especially when the scattering component of the channel is strong.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless information and power transfer in MIMO channels under Rician fading","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178559","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178559.pdf","startPage":"3187","endPage":"3191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Wireless information and power transfer in MIMO channels under Rician fading","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178559/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362102","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless information and power transfer in MIMO channels under Rician fading","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11505S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178566,"authors":[{"name":"Sajjad Beygi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"firstName":"Sajjad","lastName":"Beygi","id":"38230242800"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"},{"name":"Mariane R.

MSML channels are characterized by a limited number of paths, each parameterized by a delay, Doppler scale, and attenuation factor. Herein, a novel MSML channel estimator is proposed. First, in the Fourier domain, it is shown that there is an approximately linear relationship between the received signal and the Doppler scales that enables the recasting of channel estimation into a convex optimization problem. Second, the inherent sparsity of many MSML channels is exploited resulting in a further improvement in estimation performance of about 5 dB in low SNR relative to an unstructured estimation method. Finally, the resultant estimation strategy has very low implementation complexity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178566.pdf","endPage":"3226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-scale multi-lag channel estimation via linearization of training signal spectrum and sparse approximation","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178566","startPage":"3222","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-scale multi-lag channel estimation via linearization of training signal spectrum and sparse approximation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178566/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361298","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178566/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-scale multi-lag channel estimation via linearization of training signal spectrum and sparse approximation","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069548S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178567,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Mathecken","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Mathecken","id":"37856426100"},{"name":"Stefan Werner","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Werner","id":"37085427736"},{"name":"Taneli Riihonen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Taneli","lastName":"Riihonen","id":"37392216400"},{"name":"Risto Wichman","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Risto","lastName":"Wichman","id":"37360646900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178567","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of channel and phase noise estimation for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio link.

Building upon earlier works, the phase noise spectral estimate is obtained by minimizing a homogeneous quadratic cost function and the channel estimate in turns depends on the obtained phase noise estimate. We show that, at infinite signal-to-noise ratio, the true phase noise spectral estimate lies in the null space of the matrix associated with the cost function. We utilize this knowledge by imposing constraints that adhere to this null space when minimizing the cost function. In addition, we also propose constraints based on knowledge of the covariance matrix of the phase noise process. Through simulations, we demonstrate lower phase noise mean-square error (MSE) and consequently lower channel MSE when incorporating the subspace information.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178567.pdf","startPage":"3227","endPage":"3231","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace-based phase noise estimation in OFDM receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","phase noise","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace-based phase noise estimation","OFDM receivers","phase noise estimation","channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing radio link","homogeneous quadratic cost function","infinite signal-to-noise ratio","covariance matrix","phase noise mean-square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase Noise","OFDM","Channel Estimation","Null Space","Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Subspace-based phase noise estimation in OFDM receivers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178567/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361460","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace-based phase noise estimation in OFDM receivers","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080197S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178568,"authors":[{"name":"Filbert H.

First, many applications do not require the signal itself, and second-order statistics are oftentimes sufficient. The resulting requirement on the sampling rate of the original signal can therefore be reduced. Second, signal recovery from compressive samples leads to underdetermined systems which require additional constraints, such as the popular sparsity assumption. In contrast, covariance estimation can yield overdetermined problems, even from compressive samples, so that the additional constraints on the signal can be dropped. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for deriving lower bounds on the sampling rate required for covariance estimation of stationary signals, by deriving the lower Beurling density of the difference set associated with the original sampling set. A general sampling scheme is first considered, followed by the analysis of multicoset sampling. We prove that, in both cases, the sampling rate can be arbitrarily low, as was remarked extensively in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178576","startPage":"3272","endPage":"3276","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178576.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal lower bounds on sampling rates for covariance estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Universal lower bounds on sampling rates for covariance estimation","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178576/","accessionNumber":"15361693","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178576/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal lower bounds on sampling rates for covariance estimation","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061943S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178577,"authors":[{"name":"Kishore Jaganathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Caltech"],"firstName":"Kishore","lastName":"Jaganathan","id":"37543446200"},{"name":"Yonina C.

Also, the recovery techniques proposed by researchers are mostly heuristic in nature. In this work, we first show that almost all signals can be uniquely identified by their STFT magnitude under mild conditions.

Our approach uses a linear programming (LP) relaxation and allows us to find interpretable (sparse) classification rules that achieve good generalization accuracy. However, the resulting LP representation for problems with either a large number of samples or large number of continuous features tends to become challenging for off-the-shelf LP solvers. We have explored a screening approach which allows us to dramatically reduce the number of active features without sacrificing optimality. In this work we explore reducing the number of samples in a sequential setting where we can certify reaching a near-optimal solution while only solving the LP on a small fraction of the available data points. In a batch setting this approach can dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the rule-learning LP formulation. In an online setting we derive stochastic upper and lower bounds on the the LP objective for unseen samples. This allows early stopping when we detect that the classifier will not change significantly with additional samples. The upper bounds are related to the learning curve literature in machine learning, and our lower bounds appear not to have been explored. Finally, we discuss a quick approach to compute the complete regularization path balancing rule interpretability versus accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178589","startPage":"3337","endPage":"3341","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178589.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning interpretable classification rules using sequential rowsampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning interpretable classification rules using sequential rowsampling","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178589/","accessionNumber":"15361889","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178589/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning interpretable classification rules using sequential rowsampling","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062021S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178590,"authors":[{"name":"Ashkan Panahi","affiliation":["Signal processing Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ashkan","lastName":"Panahi","id":"37541082800"},{"name":"Mats Viberg","affiliation":["Signal processing Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Viberg","id":"37065589500"},{"name":"Babak Hassibi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Caltech, Pasadena, USA"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Hassibi","id":"37085495012"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178590","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Optimization","Parameter estimation","Signal resolution","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","signal denoising","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical implementation","gridless compressed sensing","atomic norm denoising","the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator","LASSO","off-grid parameters","spectral line estimation","numerical method","frequency estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atomic norm","LASSO","multiple parameter estimation","implementation"]}],"abstract":"Atomic norm denoising has been recently introduced as a generalization of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to overcome the problem of off-grid parameters.

Many ideas have been proposed to introduce some a-priori knowledge into the algorithm to speed up its learning rate. Recently also sparsity concepts have become of interest for such algorithms. In this contribution we follow a different path by focusing on the separability of linear operators, a typical property of interest when dealing with tensors. Once such separability property is given, a gradient type algorithm can be derived with significant increase in learning rate. Even if separability is only given to a certain extent, we show that the algorithm can still provide gains. We derive quality and quantity measures to describe the algorithmic behavior in such contexts and evaluate its properties by Monte Carlo simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15346671","htmlLink":"/document/7178591/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"A tensor LMS algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tensor LMS algorithm","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076504S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178600,"authors":[{"name":"Siheng Chen","affiliation":["Center for Bioimage Informatics, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Siheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085436580"},{"name":"Aliaksei Sandryhaila","affiliation":["HP Vertica, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Aliaksei","lastName":"Sandryhaila","id":"37936619600"},{"name":"Jelena Kova\u010devi\u0107","affiliation":["Dept. of BME, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Kova\u010devi\u0107","id":"38241605100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178600","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":660},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Signal processing","Bandwidth","Discrete Fourier transforms","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","probability","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling theory","finite dimensional vectors","generalized bandwidth restriction","classical sampling theory","bandlimited graph signals","discrete signal processing","undirected graphs","probability constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampling theory","discrete signal processing on graphs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178600","abstract":"We propose a sampling theory for finite-dimensional vectors with a generalized bandwidth restriction, which follows the same paradigm of the classical sampling theory.

A challenging research question in such cases is the design of data clustering and classification rules when each sensor collects a set of unlabelled observations that are drawn from a known number of classes. We propose two robust distributed hybrid classification algorithms, i.e., the Diffusion K-Medians and the Communicationally Efficient Distributed K-Medians. An extensive performance analysis in comparison to a benchmark algorithm is provided that investigates the error rates in dependence of different parameters of a distributed sensor network, and also considers communication cost. Our proposed algorithms, which are insensitive to outliers and various parameters, are applicable to on-line classification problems and scale well w.r.t. the number of classes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15362172","htmlLink":"/document/7178608/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust and computationally efficient diffusion-based classification in distributed networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust and computationally efficient diffusion-based classification in distributed networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046952S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178611,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Shaghaghi","affiliation":["University of Alberta Electrical and Computer Engineering, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Shaghaghi","id":"37593379600"},{"name":"Sergiy A.

However, these methods are exposed to performance breakdown at the low SNR and/or small sample size region. It has been known for a long time that a major reason for such performance breakdown is the subspace swap phenomenon. However, in some scenarios such as the case of closely spaced sources, the breakdown happens before the subspace swap occurs. The reason is identified to be the intersubspace leakage where some portion of the true signal subspace resides in the estimated noise subspace. In this paper, we formally define the notion of subspace leakage which can be used as a measure for performance analysis and comparison of different methods used for estimating the signal and noise subspaces. We further study the statistical properties of the subspace leakage for the case of sample data covariance matrix.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178611","startPage":"3447","endPage":"3451","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178611.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace leakage analysis of sample data covariance matrix","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Subspace leakage analysis of sample data covariance matrix","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178611/","accessionNumber":"15361148","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178611/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace leakage analysis of sample data covariance matrix","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048119S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178612,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Song","affiliation":["Signal and System Theory Group, Universit\u00e4t Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Song","id":"37716889400"},{"name":"Peter J.

We derive for the first time the closed-form expressions for the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) of the code-aided (CA) DOA estimates from arbitrary square-QAM modulated signals. We succeed in factorizing the likelihood function of the system into two analogous terms linearizing thereby all the derivation steps of the Fisher information (FI) element. Simulation results demonstrate that the CRLB for the CA DOA estimates lies between its counterparts in non-data-aided (NDA) and data-aided (DA) estimation schemes. Moreover, the DOA CA CRLB improves by decreasing the coding rate highlighting thereby the potential gain in estimation performance stemming from the proper exploitation of the decoder output.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178620.pdf","startPage":"3492","endPage":"3496","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds for DOA estimation from turbo-coded square-QAM-modulated transmissions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Turbo codes","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","quadrature amplitude modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds","DOA estimation","turbo-coded square-QAM-modulated transmissions","direction of arrival estimation","likelihood function","Fisher information element","estimation performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction of arrival (DOA)","code-aided (CA)","Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB)","square-QAM modulations","turbo codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds for DOA estimation from turbo-coded square-QAM-modulated transmissions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178620/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361806","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds for DOA estimation from turbo-coded square-QAM-modulated transmissions","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003492.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073763S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178628,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo P.

Relationships between the degree of circularity of the input signal and the bound on the step-sizes of the CLMS and ACLMS are also established. We also show that for both CLMS and ACLMS, the steady-state misadjustment increases with the degree of non-circularity of the input signal. Simulations in the context of frequency estimation in power grid support the analyses.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178628.pdf","startPage":"3531","endPage":"3535","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean square analysis of the CLMS and ACLMS for non-circular signals: The approximate uncorrelating transform approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Steady-state","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Least squares approximations","Frequency estimation","Optimized production technology","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","frequency estimation","least mean squares methods","signal processing","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square analysis","CLMS","ACLMS","noncircular signal","approximate uncorrelating transform approach","complex-least mean square algorithm","augmented CLMS algorithm","augmented covariance matrix diagonalisation","AUT approach","pseudocovariance matrix","singular value decomposition","SVD","steady-state mean square stability","transient mean square stability","frequency estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex least mean square (CLMS)","augmented statistics","mean square convergence","non-circularity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mean square analysis of the CLMS and ACLMS for non-circular signals: The approximate uncorrelating transform approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178628/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361292","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean square analysis of the CLMS and ACLMS for non-circular signals: The approximate uncorrelating transform approach","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051336S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178637,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Wei Hu","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Institute of Information Science, Taipei, Taiwan ROC","Department of Comp.

Recently, phase transition analysis based on conic geometry has been found to close the gap between theoretical analysis and practical recovery result for SMV. In this paper, we explore a rigorous analysis on phase transition of MMVs.

So far, it has been suggested to choose the coefficients randomly since this choice satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with a high probability. We demonstrate that this choice may be sub-optimal since it can result in an effective array with significant sidelobes and blind spots. The sidelobes are especially problematic when we use correlation-based greedy algorithms for the sparse recovery stage as they can lead to detecting spurious peaks. To address the problem, we introduce a design methodology for constructing a measurement matrix that mitigates these unwanted effects to achieve a better DOA estimation performance. Numerical results demonstrate the usefulness of our design.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178648","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178648.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","startPage":"3631","endPage":"3635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of the measurement matrix for Compressed Sensing based DOA estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the design of the measurement matrix for Compressed Sensing based DOA estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178648/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361172","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178648/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of the measurement matrix for Compressed Sensing based DOA estimation","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060314S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178650,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-Ji Liu","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Xin-Ji","lastName":"Liu","id":"38581031900"},{"name":"Shu-Tao Xia","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Shu-Tao","lastName":"Xia","id":"37288202600"},{"name":"Tao Dai","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085521946"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178650","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","compressed sensing","matrix algebra","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic binary measurement matrix construction","compressed sensing","permutation submatrix blocks","circulant submatrix blocks","zero submatrix blocks","Johnson bound","binary constant weight codes","uniform column weights","sampling technique","sparse signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","deterministic measurement matrix","coherence","Johnson bound","Welch bound"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a general framework to deterministically construct binary measurement matrices for compressed sensing.

Quantifying this sensitivity in order to predict the result of signal recovery is therefore valuable when no a priori information can be exploited, e.g., when the encoding matrix is randomly perturbed without any exploitable structure. We tackle this aspect by means of a simplified model for the signal recovery problem, which enables the derivation of an average performance estimate that depends only on the interaction between the sensing and perturbation matrices. The effectiveness of the resulting heuristic is demonstrated by numerical exploration of signal recovery under three simple perturbation matrix models. Finally, we show how this estimate matches very well the degradation experienced by non-perfectly informed decoders in applications of compressed sensing to protecting the acquired information content in ECG tracks and sensitive images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average recovery performances of non-perfectly informed compressed sensing: With applications to multiclass encryption","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178652","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178652.pdf","startPage":"3651","endPage":"3655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Average recovery performances of non-perfectly informed compressed sensing: With applications to multiclass encryption","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178652/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362114","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average recovery performances of non-perfectly informed compressed sensing: With applications to multiclass encryption","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12501S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178653,"authors":[{"name":"Zubair Khalid","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Zubair","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37720282000"},{"name":"Rodney A.

Such methods employ uniform projection schemes on hyperspheres in order to estimate the local mean, thus requiring dense but underutilised sampling when processing unbalanced data channels. To this end, we propose a nonuniform projection scheme that adapts to the second order statistics of trivariate data; this provides the estimation of the local mean in the case of power imbalances and correlations between the channels. The algorithm is particularly useful for generating a low number of direction vectors within MEMD. Its performance is illustrated on synthetic and real-world data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniformly sampled trivariate empirical mode decomposition","multichannel data-driven time-frequency algorithms","inter-channel dependencies","uniform projection schemes","underutilised sampling","second order statistics","MEMD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Trivariate EMD","non-uniform sampling","Hilbert transform","multiscale processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178660","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178660.pdf","startPage":"3691","endPage":"3695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniformly sampled trivariate empirical mode decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniformly sampled trivariate empirical mode decomposition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178660/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178660/","accessionNumber":"15361379","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniformly sampled trivariate empirical mode decomposition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0003691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059921S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178673,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Borgerding","affiliation":["Dept.

With the rapid increase of data amount, efficiently downsampling a big dataset, while at the same time keeping the structure of subspaces, becomes an important topic for SSC. In order to reduce the computational cost while preserving clustering accuracy, a new approach of SSC with downsampling (SSCD) is proposed in this paper. In SSCD, the numbers of samples located in respective subspaces are estimated utilizing the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n norm of the sparse representation. Then a downsampling strategy is designed to decimate samples with the probabilities that are in reverse ratio to the amounts of samples in respective subspaces. As a consequence, the samples in different subspaces are expected to be balanced after the downsampling operation. Theoretical analysis proves the correctness of the proposed strategy.

Using only two-channel recordings, MESSL clusters spectrogram points based on their interaural spatial cues. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are assumed for the interaural cues and their corresponding parameters are determined by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) via the expectation maximization (EM) framework. However, the presence of singularities and over-fitting are major drawbacks of MLE. In this paper, we investigate variational Bayesian (VB) inference for clustering spectrogram points based particularly on their interaural phase difference (IPD) cues. Variational inference overcomes the difficulties associated with the likelihood optimization and improves the separation especially when the sources are in close proximity.

The goal is to resolve a Dirac distribution from knowledge of its discrete, low-pass, Fourier measurements. Classically, such problems have been dealt with parameter estimation methods. Recently, it has been shown that convex-optimization based formulations facilitate a continuous time solution to the super-resolution problem. Here we treat super-resolution from low-pass measurements in Phase Space. The Phase Space transformation parametrically generalizes a number of well known unitary mappings such as the Fractional Fourier, Fresnel, Laplace and Fourier transforms. Consequently, our work provides a general super-resolution strategy which is backward compatible with the usual Fourier domain result. We consider low-pass measurements of Dirac distributions in Phase Space and show that the super-resolution problem can be cast as Total Variation minimization. Remarkably, even though are setting is quite general, the bounds on the minimum separation distance of Dirac distributions is comparable to existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","startPage":"4155","endPage":"4159","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178753.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178753","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Extraterrestrial measurements","Signal resolution","Geophysical measurements","Image resolution","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier analysis","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase space","Dirac distribution","Fourier measurements","parameter estimation methods","convex-optimization based formulations","general super-resolution strategy","total variation minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fractional Fourier","low-pass","phase space","spike train","super-resolution","total variation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Super-resolution in Phase Space","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178753/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178753/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-resolution in Phase Space","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074999S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7178755,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Nested Sampling (NS) is one of the possible methods. The key step that reflects the efficiency of the NS algorithm is how to get samples with hard constraint on the likelihood value. This contribution is based on the classical idea where the new sample is drawn within a hyper-ellipsoid, the latter being located from Gaussian approximation. This sampling strategy can automatically guarantee the hard constraint on the likelihood. Meanwhile, it shows the best sampling efficiency for models which have Gaussian-like likelihood distributions. We apply this method in ECT. The simulation results show that this method has high model choice ability and good parameter estimation accuracy, and low computational cost meanwhile.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","eddy current testing","Gaussian distribution","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","nested sampling strategy","eddy current sensing","NS algorithm","hyper ellipsoid","Gaussian approximation","Gaussian-like likelihood distribution","ECT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nested Sampling","metamodeling","model choice","Bayesian","parameter estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178755","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178755.pdf","startPage":"4165","endPage":"4169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient model choice and parameter estimation by using nested sampling applied in Eddy-Current Testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient model choice and parameter estimation by using nested sampling applied in Eddy-Current Testing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178755/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178755/","accessionNumber":"15361173","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient model choice and parameter estimation by using nested sampling applied in Eddy-Current Testing","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058195S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178762,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Song","affiliation":["USTC, National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Song","id":"37077893100"},{"name":"Ruilian Cui","affiliation":["USTC, National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing"],"firstName":"Ruilian","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085619890"},{"name":"Xinhai Hong","affiliation":["USTC, National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing"],"firstName":"Xinhai","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085631777"},{"name":"Ian Mcloughlin","affiliation":["USTC, National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Mcloughlin","id":"37284239200"},{"name":"Jiong Shi","affiliation":["Anhui Post and Telecommunication College"],"firstName":"Jiong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085620698"},{"name":"Lirong Dai","affiliation":["USTC, National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing"],"firstName":"Lirong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085384339"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178762","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178762","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","NIST","Speech","Acoustics","Training","Kernel","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","speech processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental performance gain","dialect recognition task","NIST LRE2009 dataset","DBN-MidLayer","DBN-TopLayer","internal bottleneck layer","high-level phonetic output feature","low-level acoustic input feature","DNN structure","short-duration utterance identification task","dialect identification task","front-end feature extractor","pretrained deep neural network","LID","automatic spoken language identification","deep bottleneck network","improved language identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Language Identification","Deep Neural Network","Bottleneck Feature","Representation Learning"]}],"abstract":"Effective representation plays an important role in automatic spoken language identification (LID). Recently, several representations that employ a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) as the front-end feature extractor, have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However the performance is still far from satisfactory for dialect and short-duration utterance identification tasks, due to the deficiency of existing representations. To address this issue, this paper proposes the improved representations to exploit the information extracted from different layers of the DNN structure. This is conceptually motivated by regarding the DNN as a bridge between low-level acoustic input and high-level phonetic output features. Specifically, we employ deep bottleneck network (DBN), a DNN with an internal bottleneck layer acting as a feature extractor. We extract representations from two layers of this single network, i.e. DBN-TopLayer and DBN-MidLayer. Evaluations on the NIST LRE2009 dataset, as well as the more specific dialect recognition task, show that each representation can achieve an incremental performance gain. Furthermore, a simple fusion of the representations is shown to exceed current state-of-the-art performance.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178762.pdf","startPage":"4200","endPage":"4204","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved language identification using deep bottleneck network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improved language identification using deep bottleneck network","htmlLink":"/document/7178762/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361570","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved language identification using deep bottleneck network","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048995S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178765,"authors":[{"name":"Keiichi Tokuday","affiliation":["Google, UK"],"firstName":"Keiichi","lastName":"Tokuday","id":"37087856836"},{"name":"Heiga Zen","affiliation":["Google"],"firstName":"Heiga","lastName":"Zen","id":"37284827900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178765","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":174},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178765","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel approach for directly-modeling speech at the waveform level using a neural network.

In contrast to traditional joint-sequence based G2P approaches, LSTMs have the flexibility of taking into consideration the full context of graphemes and transform the problem from a series of grapheme-to-phoneme conversions to a word-to-pronunciation conversion. Training joint-sequence based G2P require explicit grapheme-to-phoneme alignments which are not straightforward since graphemes and phonemes don't correspond one-to-one. The LSTM based approach forgoes the need for such explicit alignments. We experiment with unidirectional LSTM (ULSTM) with different kinds of output delays and deep bidirectional LSTM (DBLSTM) with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) layer. The DBLSTM-CTC model achieves a word error rate (WER) of 25.8% on the public CMU dataset for US English. Combining the DBLSTM-CTC model with a joint n-gram model results in a WER of 21.3%, which is a 9% relative improvement compared to the previous best WER of 23.4% from a hybrid system.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178767","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178767.pdf","startPage":"4225","endPage":"4229","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion using Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion using Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361231","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178767/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion using Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062209S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7178776,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Variani","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD, USA","Google, USA"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Variani","id":"37077212800"},{"name":"Erik McDermott","affiliation":["Google Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"McDermott","id":"37284915300"},{"name":"Georg Heigold","affiliation":["Google Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Heigold","id":"37550566800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178776","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":614},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Training","Optimization","Joints","Neural networks","Speech recognition","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","gradient methods","mixture models","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian mixture model layer","discriminative features","deep neural network architecture","asynchronous stochastic gradient descent","feature extraction layers","optimization criterion","word error rates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural networks","feature extraction","classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178776","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178776.pdf","startPage":"4270","endPage":"4274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Gaussian Mixture Model layer jointly optimized with discriminative features within a Deep Neural Network architecture","abstract":"This article proposes and evaluates a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) represented as the last layer of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture and jointly optimized with all previous layers using Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD).

In contrast to this, in the tandem approach neural network output is used as input features to improve classic Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based emission probability estimates. This paper shows that GMM can be easily integrated into the deep neural network framework. By exploiting its equivalence with the log-linear mixture model (LMM), GMM can be transformed to a large softmax layer followed by a summation pooling layer. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the jointly trained and optimally chosen GMM and bottleneck tandem features cannot perform worse than a hybrid model. Thus, the question \u201chybrid vs. tandem\u201d simplifies to optimizing the output layer of a neural network. Speech recognition experiments are carried out on a broadcast news and conversations task using up to 12 feed-forward hidden layers with sigmoid and rectified linear unit activation functions. The evaluation of the LMM layer shows recognition gains over the classic softmax output.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361176","htmlLink":"/document/7178779/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integrating Gaussian mixtures into deep neural networks: Softmax layer with hidden variables","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Gaussian mixtures into deep neural networks: Softmax layer with hidden variables","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07985S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178780,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Bell","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Bell","id":"37666439100"},{"name":"Steve Renals","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Renals","id":"37085676399"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178780","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":181},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularization of context-dependent deep neural networks with context-independent multi-task training","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178780.pdf","startPage":"4290","endPage":"4294","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178780","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Context","Context modeling","Data models","Training data","Standards","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-dependent deep neural network regularization","context-independent multitask training","context-dependent target optimization","hybrid DNN systems","automatic speech recognition","multitask learning method","monophone target prediction","large-vocabulary lecture recognition task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep neural networks","multitask learning","regularization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178780","abstract":"The use of context-dependent targets has become standard in hybrid DNN systems for automatic speech recognition.

We discuss mathematical equivalence between speaker informed DNN training and \u201cbias adaptation\u201d which uses speaker dependent biases, and give detailed analysis on influential factors such as dimension, discrimination and stability of auxiliary codes. The analysis is supported by experiments on a meeting recognition task using bottleneck feature based system. Results show that i-vector based adaptation is also effective in bottleneck feature based system (not just hybrid systems). However all tested methods show poor generalisation to unseen speakers. We introduce a system based on speaker classification followed by speaker adaptation of biases, which yields equivalent performance to an i-vector based system with 10.4% relative improvement over baseline on seen speakers.

The approach introduces slope and bias parameters in the sigmoid activation functions for each speaker, allowing the adaptation model to be stored in a small-sized storage space. We show that this adaptation technique can be formulated in a linear regression fashion, analogous to other speak adaptation algorithms that apply additional linear transformations to the DNN layers.

However, it remains as an open problem how to rapidly adapt these networks with limited, unsupervised, data. Most existing methods to adapt a neural network involve modifying a large number of parameters thus rapid adaptation is not possible with these schemes. In this paper, the multi-basis adaptive neural network is proposed, a new neural network configuration which only requires very few parameters for adaptation. By modifying the topology of a single multi-layer perception, a set of sub-networks with restricted connectivity are introduced to collaboratively capture different acoustic properties. The outputs of those sub-networks are combined by speaker-dependent interpolation weights. In addition, the complete system can be optimized in an adaptive training fashion when non-homogeneous training data are used. The performance of unsupervised adaptation is evaluated on two datasets. It outperforms the speaker-independent hybrid DNN-HMM baseline both on the Broadcast News English and the AURORA-4 tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361710","htmlLink":"/document/7178785/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-basis adaptive neural network for rapid adaptation in speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-basis adaptive neural network for rapid adaptation in speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094701S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178786,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Cui","affiliation":["IBM T.

still exists big performance degradation if the acoustic condition of the test data mismatches that of the training data. Hence, adaptation and adaptive training of DNN are of great research interest. Previous works mainly focus on adapting the parameters of a single DNN by regularized or selective fine-tuning, applying linear transforms to feature or hidden-layer output, or introducing vector representation of non-speech variability into the input. These methods all require relatively large number of parameters to be estimated during adaptation. In contrast, this paper employs the cluster adaptive training (CAT) framework for DNN adaptation. Here, multiple DNNs are constructed to form the bases of a canonical parametric space. During adaptation, an interpolation vector, specific to a particular acoustic condition, is used to combine the multiple DNN bases into a single adapted DNN. The DNN bases can also be constructed at layer level for more flexibility. The CAT-DNN approach was evaluated on an English switchboard task in unsupervised adaptation mode. It achieved significant WER reductions over the unadapted DNN-HMM, relative 6% to 8.5%, with only 10 parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361370","htmlLink":"/document/7178787/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cluster adaptive training for deep neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster adaptive training for deep neural network","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075101S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178794,"authors":[{"name":"Takuya Yoshioka","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Yoshioka","id":"37410482600"},{"name":"Shigeki Karita","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan","Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeki","lastName":"Karita","id":"37085400210"},{"name":"Tomohiro Nakatani","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37342222600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178794","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":612},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Speech","Reverberation","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","hidden Markov models","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["far-field speech recognition","convolutional neural networks","deep neural networks","hidden Markov model","CNN-DNN-HMM","time convolution","spectral energy","time axis","short time correlations","feature vectors","signal-space dereverberation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Far-field speech recognition","reverberation","convolutional neural network","deep neural network"]}],"abstract":"Recent studies in speech recognition have shown that the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is superior to that of fully connected deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore the use of CNNs in far-field speech recognition for dealing with reverberation, which blurs spectral energies along the time axis. Unlike most previous CNN applications to speech recognition, we consider convolution in time to examine whether it provides an improved reverberation modelling capability. Experimental results show that a CNN coupled with a fully connected DNN can model short time correlations in feature vectors with fewer parameters than a DNN and thus generalise better to unseen test environments. Combining this approach with signal-space dereverberation, which copes with long-term correlations, is shown to result in further improvement, where the gains from both approaches are almost additive. An initial investigation of the use of restricted convolution forms is also undertaken.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178794.pdf","startPage":"4360","endPage":"4364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Far-field speech recognition using CNN-DNN-HMM with convolution in time","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Far-field speech recognition using CNN-DNN-HMM with convolution in time","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361744","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178794/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Far-field speech recognition using CNN-DNN-HMM with convolution in time","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075844S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178795,"authors":[{"name":"Masato Mimura","affiliation":["Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Mimura","id":"37592560300"},{"name":"Shinsuke Sakai","affiliation":["Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinsuke","lastName":"Sakai","id":"37085634111"},{"name":"Tatsuya Kawahara","affiliation":["Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Kawahara","id":"37276469500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178795","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Training","Acoustics","Speech enhancement","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","reverberation","signal representation","smart phones","speech coding","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverberant speech recognition","DAE","deep autoencoder","DNN acoustic model","deep neural network","deep learning scheme","mapping","acoustic information","phone class feature","standard acoustic feature","monophone DNN","soft representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reverberant speech recognition","Deep Neural Networks (DNN)","Deep Autoencoder (DAE)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep autoencoders augmented with phone-class feature for reverberant speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","endPage":"4369","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178795.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178795","startPage":"4365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178795","abstract":"This paper addresses reverberant speech recognition based on front-end processing using DAE (Deep AutoEncoder) coupled with DNN (Deep Neural Network) acoustic model. DAE can effectively and flexibly learn mapping from corrupted speech to the original clean speech based on the deep learning scheme. While this mapping is conventionally conducted only with the acoustic information, we presume the mapping is also dependent on the phone information. Therefore, we propose a new scheme (pDAE), which augments a phone-class feature to the standard acoustic features as input. Two types of the phone-class feature are investigated. One is the hard recognition result of monophones, and the other is a soft representation derived from the posterior outputs of monophone DNN. In the evaluation on the Reverb Challenge 2014 task, the augmented feature in either type results in a significant improvement (7-8% relative) from the standard DAE. It is also shown that using the soft representation in the training phase is critical.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15361709","htmlLink":"/document/7178795/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deep autoencoders augmented with phone-class feature for reverberant speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep autoencoders augmented with phone-class feature for reverberant speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08229S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178796,"authors":[{"name":"Atsunori Ogawa","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"],"firstName":"Atsunori","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37627219100"},{"name":"Takaaki Hori","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"],"firstName":"Takaaki","lastName":"Hori","id":"37711768100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178796","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Training data","Speech recognition","Recurrent neural networks","Speech","Accuracy","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASR error detection","ASR recognition rate estimation","deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks","automatic speech recognition","sequential labeling problems","confidence estimation","out-of-vocabulary word detection","error type classification","word vector representation","low-dimensional continuous space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","error detection","recognition rate estimation","deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks","generalization ability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178796","abstract":"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been applied as the classifiers for sequential labeling problems. In this paper, deep bidirectional RNNs (DBRNNs) are applied for the first time to error detection in automatic speech recognition (ASR), which is a sequential labeling problem. We investigate three types of ASR error detection tasks, i.e. confidence estimation, out-of-vocabulary word detection and error type classification. We also estimate recognition rates from the error type classification results. Experimental results show that the DBRNNs greatly outperform conditional random fields (CRFs), especially for the detection of infrequent error labels. The DBRNNs also slightly outperform the CRFs in recognition rate estimation. In addition, experiments using a reduced size of training data suggest that the DBRNNs have a better generalization ability than the CRFs owing to their word vector representation in a low-dimensional continuous space. As a result, the DBRNNs trained using only 20% of the training data show higher error detection performance than the CRFs trained using the full training data.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178796","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178796.pdf","startPage":"4370","endPage":"4374","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASR error detection and recognition rate estimation using deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"ASR error detection and recognition rate estimation using deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15346622","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178796/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASR error detection and recognition rate estimation using deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0927S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7178797,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Gao","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.

In this paper, we show how these data can be used to improve hybrid DNN-HMM ASR systems for a vehicle-based speech recognition task. Feature fusion is accomplished by augmenting acoustic features with additional side information before being presented to the DNN acoustic model. The additional features are extracted from the vehicle speed, HVAC status, windshield wiper status, and vehicle type. This supplementary information improves the DNNs ability to discriminate phonetic events in an environment-aware way without having to make any modification to the DNN training algorithms.

Typically, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to estimate an ideal time-frequency mask, and clean speech is produced by feeding the mask-weighted output to a resynthesizer in a subsequent step. So far, the success of DNN-based separation lies mainly in improving human speech intelligibility. In this work, we propose a new deep network that directly reconstructs the time-domain clean signal through an inverse fast Fourier transform layer. The joint training of speech resynthesis and mask estimation yields improved objective quality while maintaining the objective intelligibility performance. The proposed system significantly outperforms a recent non-negative matrix factorization based separation system in both objective speech intelligibility and quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361368","htmlLink":"/document/7178800/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A deep neural network for time-domain signal reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deep neural network for time-domain signal reconstruction","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056814S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178801,"authors":[{"name":"Kehuang Li","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Kehuang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085707683"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chin-Hui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178801","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Narrowband","Wideband","Training","Feature extraction","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","phase estimation","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech bandwidth expansion","deep neural network approach","spectral mapping function","log-spectrum power","nonlinear transformation","high-dimensional mapping function","speech signals","objective quality measures","segmental signal-to-noise ratio","log-spectral distortion","phase information","narrowband signal","phase recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","speech bandwidth expansion","spectrum mapping","phase estimation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a deep neural network (DNN) approach to speech bandwidth expansion (BWE) by estimating the spectral mapping function from narrowband (4 kHz in bandwidth) to wideband (8 kHz in bandwidth).

When evaluating the proposed approach on a large-scale 10-hour test set, we found that the DNN-expanded speech signals give excellent objective quality measures in terms of segmental signal-to-noise ratio and log-spectral distortion when compared with conventional BWE based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Subjective listening tests also give a 69% preference score for DNN-expanded speech over 31% for GMM when the phase information is assumed known. For tests in real operation when the phase information is imaged from the given narrowband signal the preference comparison goes up to 84% versus 16%.

The articulatory parameters of the current frame may have correlations with the acoustic features many frames before or after. The traditional pre-designed fixed-length context window may be either insufficient or redundant to cover such correlation information. The advantage of recurrent neural network is that it can learn proper context information on its own without the requirement of externally specifying a context window. Experimental results indicate that recurrent model can produce more accurate predictions for acoustic-to-articulatory inversion than deep neural network having fixed-length context window. Furthermore, the predicted articulatory trajectory curve of recurrent neural network is smooth. Average root mean square error of 0.816 mm on the MNGU0 test set is achieved without any post-filtering, which is state-of-the-art inversion accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178812.pdf","startPage":"4450","endPage":"4454","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deep recurrent approach for acoustic-to-articulatory inversion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Speech","Trajectory","Recurrent neural networks","Acoustics","Hidden Markov models","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic-to-articulatory inversion problem","deep bidirectional long short term memory recurrent neural network","deep recurrent mixture density network","pre-designed fixed-length context window","root mean square error","MNGU0 test set","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["long short term memory (LSTM)","recurrent nueral network (RNN)","mixture density network (MDN)","layer-wise pre-training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"A deep recurrent approach for acoustic-to-articulatory inversion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178812/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361461","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deep recurrent approach for acoustic-to-articulatory inversion","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074434S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178813,"authors":[{"name":"Kei Hashimoto","affiliation":["Department of Scientific and Engineering Simulation, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37634048800"},{"name":"Keiichiro Oura","affiliation":["Department of Scientific and Engineering Simulation, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiichiro","lastName":"Oura","id":"37410903800"},{"name":"Yoshihiko Nankaku","affiliation":["Department of Scientific and Engineering Simulation, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiko","lastName":"Nankaku","id":"37284437700"},{"name":"Keiichi Tokuda","affiliation":["Department of Scientific and Engineering Simulation, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiichi","lastName":"Tokuda","id":"37085618689"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178813","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"abstract":"This paper investigates how to use neural networks in statistical parametric speech synthesis.

To address this concern, this paper proposes a low-latency, streaming speech synthesis architecture using unidirectional LSTM-RNNs with a recurrent output layer. The use of unidirectional RNN architecture allows frame-synchronous streaming inference of output acoustic features given input linguistic features. The recurrent output layer further encourages smooth transition between acoustic features at consecutive frames.

The experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve the quality of synthesized speech objectively and subjectively, comparing with speech synthesized from the individual, speaker-dependent DNN-based TTS.

This paper investigates the recently proposed exemplar-based speech enhancement technique using coupled dictionaries as a pre-processing stage for DNN-based systems. In this setting, the noisy speech is decomposed as a weighted sum of atoms in an input dictionary containing exemplars sampled from a domain of choice, and the resulting weights are applied to a coupled output dictionary containing exemplars sampled in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain to directly obtain the speech and noise estimates for speech enhancement. In this work, settings using input dictionary of exemplars sampled from the STFT, Mel-integrated magnitude STFT and modulation envelope spectra are evaluated. Experiments performed on the AURORA-4 database revealed that these pre-processing stages can improve the performance of the DNN-HMM-based ASR systems with both clean and multi-condition training.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178819.pdf","startPage":"4485","endPage":"4489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exemplar-based speech enhancement for deep neural network based automatic speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178819","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Exemplar-based speech enhancement for deep neural network based automatic speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362043","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178819/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exemplar-based speech enhancement for deep neural network based automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082671S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178826,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangang Li","affiliation":["Speech and Hearing Research Center, Peking University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Xiangang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085389879"},{"name":"Xihong Wu","affiliation":["Speech and Hearing Research Center, Peking University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Xihong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293515000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178826","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":985},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Training","Speech","Computer architecture","Recurrent neural networks","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training process","multiGPU device","telephone speech recognition task","RNN","hierarchical model","acoustic modeling method","deep LSTM network","large vocabulary speech recognition","deep recurrent neural network","long short-term memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["long short-term memory","recurrent neural networks","deep neural networks","acoustic modeling","large vocabulary speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"Long short-term memory (LSTM) based acoustic modeling methods have recently been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on some speech recognition tasks.

However, this superiority is usually demonstrated when the data used to learn the features is very similar in character to the data used to test recognition performance. An open question is how well these learned features generalize to realistic data that is different in character to their training data. The ability of a feature representation to generalize to unfamiliar data is a highly desirable form of robustness. In this paper we investigate the robustness of two DNN-based feature sets to training/test mismatch using the ICSI meeting corpus. The experiments were performed under 3 training/test scenarios: (1) matched near-field (2) matched far-field and (3) the mismatched condition near-field training with far-field testing. The experiments leverage simulation and a novel sampling process that we have developed for diagnostic analysis within the HMM-based speech recognition framework. First, diagnostic analysis shows that a DNN-based feature representation that uses MFCC inputs (MFCC-DNN) is indeed superior to the corresponding MFCC baselines in the two matched scenarios where the source of recognition errors are from incorrect model, but the DNN-based features and MFCCs have nearly identical and poor performance in the mismatched scenario. Second, we show that a DNN-based feature representation that uses a more robust input, namely power normalized spectrum (PNS) and Gabor filters, performs nearly as well as the MFCC-DNN features in the matched scenarios and much better than MFCCs and MFCC-DNNs in the mismatched scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362144","htmlLink":"/document/7178828/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the importance of modeling and robustness for deep neural network feature","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the importance of modeling and robustness for deep neural network feature","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071197S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178829,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Delcroix","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Delcroix","id":"37425994200"},{"name":"Keisuke Kinoshita","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kinoshita","id":"37420926300"},{"name":"Takaaki Hori","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaaki","lastName":"Hori","id":"37711768100"},{"name":"Tomohiro Nakatani","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37342222600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178829","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":372},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context adaptive deep neural networks for fast acoustic model adaptation","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178829.pdf","startPage":"4535","endPage":"4539","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178829","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Context","Training","Adaptation models","Neural networks","Tuning","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context adaptive deep neural networks","fast acoustic model adaptation","acoustic modeling","automatic speech recognition","ASR","DNN-based acoustic model","external factors","weighted averaging","TIMIT phoneme recognition task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","Deep neural networks","Acoustic model adaptation","Context adaptive DNN","Factorized DNN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178829","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for acoustic modeling in automatic speech recognition (ASR), since they greatly outperform legacy Gaussian mixture model-based systems.

Consequently, research on DNN adaptation has recently attracted much interest. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the fast adaptation of a DNN-based acoustic model to the acoustic context. We introduce a context adaptive DNN with one or several layers depending on external factors that represent the acoustic conditions. This is realized by introducing a factorized layer that uses a different set of parameters to process each class of factors. The output of the factorized layer is then obtained by weighted averaging over the contribution of the different factor classes, given posteriors over the factor classes.

We observe that scattering features outperform baseline log-mel in all conditions, with additional gains from multi-resolution processing.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178832","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178832.pdf","startPage":"4550","endPage":"4554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating Deep Scattering Spectra with deep neural networks on large scale spontaneous speech task","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362130","htmlLink":"/document/7178832/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating Deep Scattering Spectra with deep neural networks on large scale spontaneous speech task","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07988S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178833,"authors":[{"name":"Shaofei Xue","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei"],"firstName":"Shaofei","lastName":"Xue","id":"37085346275"},{"name":"Hui Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, York University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272625700"},{"name":"Lirong Dai","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei"],"firstName":"Lirong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37273869000"},{"name":"Qingfeng Liu","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei"],"firstName":"Qingfeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37420537200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178833","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Hidden Markov models","Adaptation models","Speech recognition","Training","Speech","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","neural nets","singular value decomposition","speech recognition","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural network","discriminant condition codes","frame-level cross-entropy","sequence-level maximum mutual information training criterion","speaker code","DNN","singular value decomposition","SVD","connection weights","unsupervised speaker adaptation","large vocabulary speech recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Network (DNN)","Speaker Code","Speaker Adaptation","singular value decomposition (SVD)"]}],"abstract":"Recently, we have proposed a general adaptation scheme for deep neural network based on discriminant condition codes and applied it to supervised speaker adaptation in speech recognition based on either frame-level cross-entropy or sequence-level maximum mutual information training criterion [1, 2, 3, 4]. In this case, each condition code is associated with one speaker in data, which is thus called speaker code for convenience. Our previous work has shown that speaker code based methods are quite effective in adapting DNNs even when only a very small amount of adaptation data is available. However, we have to use a large speaker code size and complex processes to obtain the best ASR performance since good initializations of speaker codes and connection weights are very important. In this paper, we propose a method using singular value decomposition (SVD) as in [5] to initialize speaker codes and connection weights to obtain a comparable ASR performance as before but with a smaller speaker code size and much less computation complexity. Meanwhile, we have evaluated unsupervised speaker adaptation with the proposed method in large vocabulary speech recognition in the Switchboard task. Experimental results have shown that it is effective for providing well initializations and suitable in adapting large DNN models.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178833.pdf","startPage":"4555","endPage":"4559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised speaker adaptation of deep neural network based on the combination of speaker codes and singular value decomposition for speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised speaker adaptation of deep neural network based on the combination of speaker codes and singular value decomposition for speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362027","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178833/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised speaker adaptation of deep neural network based on the combination of speaker codes and singular value decomposition for speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05652S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178834,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Jen-Tzung","lastName":"Chien","id":"37269128300"},{"name":"Tsai-Wei Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Tsai-Wei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085538574"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178834","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Speech","Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Neurons","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep recurrent regularization neural network acoustic model","speech recognition","hybrid Tikhonov and weight-decay regularization","restricted Boltzmann machine","backpropagation through time algorithm","BPTT algorithm","truncated minibatch training","DRRNN acoustic model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent neural network","model regularization","deep learning","acoustic model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178834","abstract":"This paper presents a deep recurrent regularization neural network (DRRNN) for speech recognition.

In addition, a new backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm is developed by extending the truncated minibatch training for recurrent neural network where the minibatch BPTT is not only performed in recurrent layer but also in feedforward layer.

One such example is the creation of context-dependent tied states, for which an efficient decision tree state tying method exists. The tied states used to train DNNs are usually obtained using the same tying algorithm, even though it is based on likelihoods of Gaussians. In this paper, we investigate an alternative state clustering method that uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of DNN output vectors to build the decision tree.

In this paper, we take advantage of the complementarity of CNNs, LSTMs and DNNs by combining them into one unified architecture. We explore the proposed architecture, which we call CLDNN, on a variety of large vocabulary tasks, varying from 200 to 2,000 hours. We find that the CLDNN provides a 4-6% relative improvement in WER over an LSTM, the strongest of the three individual models.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178838","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178838.pdf","startPage":"4580","endPage":"4584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional, Long Short-Term Memory, fully connected Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional, Long Short-Term Memory, fully connected Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178838/","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361373","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178838/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional, Long Short-Term Memory, fully connected Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084137S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"469","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7178839,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Senior","affiliation":["Google Inc., New York"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Senior","id":"37299657800"},{"name":"Ha\u015fim Sak","affiliation":["Google Inc., New York"],"firstName":"Ha\u015fim","lastName":"Sak","id":"37062959000"},{"name":"Izhak Shafran","affiliation":["Google Inc., New York"],"firstName":"Izhak","lastName":"Shafran","id":"37284863400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178839","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":582},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Context modeling","Context","Acoustics","Training","Recurrent neural networks","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context dependent phone models","LSTM RNN acoustic modelling","long short term memory recurrent neural networks","multistate hidden Markov models","large scale speech recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid neural networks","hidden Markov models","Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks","context dependent phone models"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178839","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178839.pdf","startPage":"4585","endPage":"4589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context dependent phone models for LSTM RNN acoustic modelling","abstract":"Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs), combined with hidden Markov models (HMMs), have recently been show to outperform other acoustic models such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) for large scale speech recognition.

transformation networks","abstract":"Recently, a novel speaker adaptation method was proposed that applied the Speaker Adaptive Training (SAT) concept to a speech recognizer consisting of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and its utility was demonstrated. This method implements the SAT scheme by allocating one Speaker Dependent (SD) module for each training speaker to one of the intermediate layers of the front-end DNN. It then jointly optimizes the SD modules and the other part of network, which is shared by all the speakers. In this paper, we propose an improved version of the above SAT-based adaptation scheme for a DNN-HMM recognizer. Our new training adopts a Linear Transformation Network (LTN) for the SD module, and such LTN employment leads to more appropriate regularization in both the SAT and adaptation stages by replacing an empirically selected anchorage of a network for regularization in the preceding SAT-DNN-HMM with a SAT-optimized anchorage. We elaborate the effectiveness of our proposed method over TED Talks corpus data. Our experimental results show that a speaker-adapted recognizer using our method achieves a significant word error rate reduction of 9.2 points from a baseline SI-DNN recognizer and also steadily outperforms speaker-adapted recognizers, each of which originates from the preceding SAT-based DNN-HMM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361277","htmlLink":"/document/7178843/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speaker adaptive training for deep neural networks embedding linear transformation networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker adaptive training for deep neural networks embedding linear transformation networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060395S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178844,"authors":[{"name":"Hengguan Huang","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore"],"firstName":"Hengguan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085697839"},{"name":"Khe Chai Sim","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore"],"firstName":"Khe Chai","lastName":"Sim","id":"38240429000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178844","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":377},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Acoustics","Training","Speech","Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","neural nets","probability","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker representations","speaker normalisation","deep neural networks","speaker-independent DNN","short-term features","DNN speaker classifier","feature extraction","first-order bottleneck speaker super vector","BSSV","phoneme posterior probabilities","FMLLR-shifted features","robust DNN-based automatic speech recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speaker normalisation","augmented speaker representation","deep neural network","speech recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178844.pdf","startPage":"4610","endPage":"4613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation of augmenting speaker representations to improve speaker normalisation for DNN-based speech recognition","abstract":"The conventional short-term interval features used by the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) lack the ability to learn longer term information. This poses a challenge for training a speaker-independent (SI) DNN since the short-term features do not provide sufficient information for the DNN to estimate the real robust factors of speaker-level variations. The key to this problem is to obtain a sufficiently robust and informative speaker representation. This paper compares several speaker representations. Firstly, a DNN speaker classifier is used to extract the bottleneck features as the speaker representation, called the Bottleneck Speaker Vector (BSV). To further improve the robustness of this representation, a first-order Bottleneck Speaker Super Vector (BSSV) is also proposed, where the BSV is expanded into a super vector space by incorporating the phoneme posterior probabilities. Finally, a more fine-grain speaker representation based on the FMLLR-shifted features is examined. The experimental results on the WSJ0 and WSJ1 datasets show that the proposed speaker representations are useful in normalising the speaker effects for robust DNN-based automatic speech recognition. The best performance is achieved by augmenting both the BSSV and the FMLLR-shifted representations, yielding 10.0% - 15.3% relatively performance gains over the SI DNN baseline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361385","htmlLink":"/document/7178844/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An investigation of augmenting speaker representations to improve speaker normalisation for DNN-based speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation of augmenting speaker representations to improve speaker normalisation for DNN-based speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054954S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178845,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ali Tahir","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ali","lastName":"Tahir","id":"38260099500"},{"name":"Simon Wiesler","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Wiesler","id":"37681194300"},{"name":"Ralf Schl\u00fcter","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Schl\u00fcter","id":"37428898000"},{"name":"Hermann Ney","affiliation":["LIMSI CNRS, Spoken Language Processing Group, Paris, France","Computer Science Department, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Ney","id":"37270687000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178845","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Training","Neural networks","Acoustics","Speech recognition","Matrix converters","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","maximum likelihood estimation","mixture models","multilayer perceptrons","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural network acoustic model","mixture splitting concept","log-linear mixture model","Gaussian mixture model","maximum likelihood","discriminative training","mixture density distribution","discriminative splitting approach","DNN","MLP hidden layers","linear bottleneck"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mixture splitting","deep neural network","linear bottleneck"]}],"abstract":"A Gaussian or log-linear mixture model trained by maximum likelihood may be trained further using discriminative training.

In this paper, we describe a convolutional neural network - deep neural network (CNN-DNN) acoustic model which takes raw multichannel waveforms as input, i.e. without any preceding feature extraction, and learns a similar feature representation through supervised training. By operating directly in the time domain, the network is able to take advantage of the signal's fine time structure that is discarded when computing filterbank magnitude features. This structure is especially useful when analyzing multichannel inputs, where timing differences between input channels can be used to localize a signal in space. The first convolutional layer of the proposed model naturally learns a filterbank that is selective in both frequency and direction of arrival, i.e. a bank of bandpass beamformers with an auditory-like frequency scale. When trained on data corrupted with noise coming from different spatial locations, the network learns to filter them out by steering nulls in the directions corresponding to the noise sources. Experiments on a simulated multichannel dataset show that the proposed acoustic model outperforms a DNN that uses log-mel filterbank magnitude features under noisy and reverberant conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178847.pdf","startPage":"4624","endPage":"4628","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech acoustic modeling from raw multichannel waveforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Acoustics","Training","Speech","Computational modeling","Feature extraction","Speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech acoustic modeling","raw multichannel waveforms","standard deep neural network-based acoustic models","automatic speech recognition","ASR","log-mel filterbank magnitudes","convolutional neural network - deep neural network acoustic model","feature extraction","feature representation","bandpass beamformers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","acoustic modeling","convolutional neural networks","beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Speech acoustic modeling from raw multichannel waveforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178847/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361526","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech acoustic modeling from raw multichannel waveforms","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122383S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178849,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper proposes to view languages as points in some rich space, termed language space, where bases are eigen-languages and a particular selection of the projection determines points. Such an approach could not only reduce development costs for each new language but also provide automatic means for language analysis. For the initial proof of the concept, this paper adopts cluster adaptive training (CAT) known for inducing similar spaces for speaker adaptation needs. The CAT approach used in this paper builds on the previous work for language adaptation in speech synthesis and extends it to Gaussian mixture modelling more appropriate for speech recognition.

In this work, we report a similar achievement in DNN-based SID performance on microphone speech. We consider two approaches to DNN-based SID: one that uses the DNN to extract features, and another that uses the DNN during feature modeling. Modeling is conducted using the DNN/i-vector framework, in which the traditional universal background model is replaced with a DNN. The recently proposed use of bottleneck features extracted from a DNN is also evaluated. Systems are first compared with a conventional universal background model (UBM) Gaussian mixture model (GMM) i-vector system on the clean conditions of the NIST 2012 speaker recognition evaluation corpus, where a lack of robustness to microphone speech is found. Several methods of DNN feature processing are then applied to bring significantly greater robustness to microphone speech. To direct future research, the DNN-based systems are also evaluated in the context of audio degradations including noise and reverberation.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178885.pdf","startPage":"4814","endPage":"4818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in deep neural network approaches to speaker recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Advances in deep neural network approaches to speaker recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178885/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in deep neural network approaches to speaker recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061438S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7178887,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojia Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaojia","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37716671100"},{"name":"Yuxuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Yuxuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"38517620800"},{"name":"DeLiang Wang","affiliation":["Center for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"DeLiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37077285500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178887","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Training","Speech recognition","Training data","NIST","Accuracy","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","source separation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel speaker identification","cochannel speech","anechoic conditions","reverberant conditions","deep neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cochannel speaker identification","reverberation","deep neural network","Gaussian mixture model","target-to-interferer ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178887","abstract":"Speaker identification (SID) in cochannel speech, where two speakers are talking simultaneously over a single recording channel, is a challenging problem.

This DNN is trained on a target voice without transcriptions, in a semi-supervised manner. Both encoder and decoder are based on neural networks and thus the vocoding is achieved using a simple fast forward pass. An experiment with French vocoding and a target male voice trained on 21 hour long audio book is presented. An application of the phonological vocoder to low bit rate speech coding is shown, where transmitted phonological posteriors are pruned and quantized.

An audio/visual database of a subject's talking is firstly recorded as our training data.

The deep BLSTM is then trained to learn the regression model by minimizing the sum of square error (SSE) of predicting visual sequence from label sequence. After testing different network topologies, we interestingly found the best network is two BLSTM layers sitting on top of one feed-forward layer on our datasets.

For the feed-forward stage, we only activate neurons whose input values are larger than a given threshold, and set the outputs of inactive nodes to zero. Thus, only a few nonzero outputs are fed to the next layer. Using this method, the output vector of each hidden layer becomes very sparse, so that the computational cost of the feed-forward algorithm can be reduced by adopting sparse matrix operations. The proposed method is evaluated in both small and large vocabulary speech recognition tasks, and results demonstrate that we can reduce the nonzero outputs to fewer than 20% of the total number of hidden nodes, without sacrificing speech recognition performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuron sparseness versus connection sparseness in deep neural network for large vocabulary speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178913","startPage":"4954","endPage":"4958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178913.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Neuron sparseness versus connection sparseness in deep neural network for large vocabulary speech recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178913/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361257","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuron sparseness versus connection sparseness in deep neural network for large vocabulary speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0656S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178914,"authors":[{"name":"Quoc Truong Do","affiliation":["Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Quoc Truong","lastName":"Do","id":"37085536460"},{"name":"Satoshi Nakamura","affiliation":["Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37273963200"},{"name":"Marc Delcroix","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Delcroix","id":"37425994200"},{"name":"Takaaki Hori","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaaki","lastName":"Hori","id":"37711768100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178914","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Speech recognition","Training","History","Acoustics","Decoding","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WFST","structural classification integrating DNN acoustic features","RNN language features","speech recognition","train weighted finite state transducer","deep neural network","DNN","acoustic features","recurrent neural network","data structure","language features","pronunciation features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Structural classification","WFST-DNN","RNNLM","Lattice rescoring","Speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a method to train Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based structural classifiers using deep neural network (DNN) acoustic features and recurrent neural network (RNN) language features for speech recognition. Structural classification is an effective approach to achieve highly accurate recognition of structured data in which the classifier is optimized to maximize the discriminative performance using different kinds of features. A WFST-based classifier, which can integrate acoustic, pronunciation, and language features embedded in a composed WFST, was recently extended to incorporate DNN bottleneck (DNNBN) features. In this paper, we further investigate the integration of a RNN language model (RNNLM) with the WFST classifier. To this end, we introduce a lattice rescoring method using a RNNLM for efficient classifier training. In a lecture transcription task, we reduced the word error rate from 19.2% to 18.6% by optimizing the WFST parameters for the DNNBN acoustic and RNNLM language features.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WFST-based structural classification integrating dnn acoustic features and RNN language features for speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178914","startPage":"4959","endPage":"4963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178914.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"WFST-based structural classification integrating dnn acoustic features and RNN language features for speech recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178914/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361393","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WFST-based structural classification integrating dnn acoustic features and RNN language features for speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072667S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178915,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085440300"},{"name":"Yajie Miao","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yajie","lastName":"Miao","id":"37077078700"},{"name":"Florian Metze","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Metze","id":"37284940200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178915","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Training","Stochastic processes","Biological neural networks","Noise","Hidden Markov models","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","neural nets","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian stochastic neurons","DNN acoustic models","deep neural network training","DropConnect","Dropout","speech samples","pre-Gaussian stochastic term","post-Gaussian stochastic term","data augmentation","time complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNN acoustical model","Dropout","Stochastic neuron"]}],"abstract":"Dropout and DropConnect can be viewed as regularization methods for deep neural network (DNN) training. In DNN acoustic modeling, the huge number of speech samples makes it expensive to sample the neuron mask (Dropout) or the weight mask (DropConnect) repetitively from a high dimensional distribution. In this paper we investigate the effect of Gaussian stochastic neurons on DNN acoustic modeling. The pre-Gaussian stochastic term can be viewed as a variant of Dropout/DropConnect and the post-Gaussian stochastic term generalizes the idea of data augmentation into hidden layers. Gaussian stochastic neurons can give improvement on large data sets where Dropout tends to be less useful. Under the low resource condition, its performance is comparable with Dropout, but with a lower time complexity during fine-tuning.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178915","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178915.pdf","startPage":"4964","endPage":"4968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularizing DNN acoustic models with Gaussian stochastic neurons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178915/","displayDocTitle":"Regularizing DNN acoustic models with Gaussian stochastic neurons","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178915/","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361425","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularizing DNN acoustic models with Gaussian stochastic neurons","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063322S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178916,"authors":[{"name":"Jingjie Li","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing, University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Jingjie","lastName":"Li","id":"37085389663"},{"name":"Ian McLoughlin","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing, University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"McLoughlin","id":"37284239200"},{"name":"Cong Liu","affiliation":["iFlytek Research"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38559904400"},{"name":"Shaofei Xue","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing, University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Shaofei","lastName":"Xue","id":"37085346275"},{"name":"Si Wei","affiliation":["iFlytek Research"],"firstName":"Si","lastName":"Wei","id":"37654959500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178916","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-task deep neural network acoustic models with model adaptation using discriminative speaker identity for whisper recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178916.pdf","startPage":"4969","endPage":"4973","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178916","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Adaptation models","Speech recognition","Acoustics","Data models","Neural networks","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","neural nets","speech recognition","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitask deep neural network acoustic models","model adaptation","discriminative speaker identity","whisper recognition","vocabulary continuous whisper automatic recognition","whisper spectra flatness","whisper spectra formant shifts","DNN acoustic models","Mandarin whisper dictation task","character error rate","baseline Gaussian Mixture Model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Whisper recognition","model adaption","speaker code","multi-task DNN","Silent speech interface"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178916","abstract":"This paper presents a study on large vocabulary continuous whisper automatic recognition (wLVCSR). wLVCSR provides the ability to use ASR equipment in public places without concern for disturbing others or leaking private information. However the task of wLVCSR is much more challenging than normal LVCSR due to the absence of pitch which not only causes the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of whispers to be much lower than normal speech but also leads to flatness and formant shifts in whisper spectra. Furthermore, the amount of whisper data available for training is much less than for normal speech. In this paper, multi-task deep neural network (DNN) acoustic models are deployed to solve these problems. Moreover, model adaptation is performed on the multi-task DNN to normalize speaker and environmental variability in whispers based on discriminative speaker identity information. On a Mandarin whisper dictation task, with 55 hours of whisper data, the proposed SI multi-task DNN model can achieve 56.7% character error rate (CER) improvement over a baseline Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), discriminatively trained only using the whisper data. Besides, the CER of the proposed model for normal speech can reach 15.2%, which is close to the performance of a state-of-the-art DNN trained with one thousand hours of speech data. From this baseline, the model-adapted DNN gains a further 10.9% CER reduction over the generic model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15346688","htmlLink":"/document/7178916/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-task deep neural network acoustic models with model adaptation using discriminative speaker identity for whisper recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-task deep neural network acoustic models with model adaptation using discriminative speaker identity for whisper recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057836S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178917,"authors":[{"name":"Nitish Shirish Keskar","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL"],"firstName":"Nitish Shirish","lastName":"Keskar","id":"37085755254"},{"name":"George Saon","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Saon","id":"37284497200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178917","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","entropy","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear programming","speech recognition","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic speech recognition system","word error rate","NewBob algorithm","nonlinear optimization","nonmonotone linesearch technique","mini-batch stochastic gradient descent","(DNN) acoustic models","deep neural network SGD training","nonmonotone learning rate strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","speech recognition","stepsize","learning rate","nonmonotonicity"]}],"abstract":"The algorithm of choice for cross-entropy training of deep neural network (DNN) acoustic models is mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Even with a singular value matrix decomposition (SVD) method and scalar quantization, the DNN model is still too large to be deployed on many mobile devices. Common practices like reducing the number of hidden nodes often result in significant accuracy loss. In this work, we propose to split each row vector of weight matrices into sub-vectors, and quantize them into a set of codewords using a split vector quantization (split-VQ) algorithm. The codebook can be fine-tuned using back-propagation when an aggressive quantization is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can further reduce the model size by 75% to 80% and save 10% to 50% computation on top of an already very compact SVD-DNN without a noticeable performance degradation. This results in a 3.2 MB-footprint DNN giving similar recognition performance as what a 59.1 MB standard DNN can achieve.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178919.pdf","startPage":"4984","endPage":"4988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-footprint high-performance deep neural network-based speech recognition using split-VQ","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178919","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Small-footprint high-performance deep neural network-based speech recognition using split-VQ","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361242","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178919/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-footprint high-performance deep neural network-based speech recognition using split-VQ","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094562S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7178920,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Ting Huang","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA"],"firstName":"Jui-Ting","lastName":"Huang","id":"38547931200"},{"name":"Jinyu Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA"],"firstName":"Jinyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279856000"},{"name":"Yifan Gong","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178920","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Speech","Neural networks","Convolution","Feature extraction","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","edge detection","filters","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","CNN","localized filters","edge detectors","deep neural networks","DNN","channel-mismatched training-test conditions","noise robustness","distant speech recognition","low-footprint models","Kinect distant speech data","word error rate reduction","WERR","sigmoid units","time 1000 hour"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks","DNN","low footprint models","maxout units"]}],"abstract":"Despite the fact that several sites have reported the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on some tasks, there is no deep analysis regarding why CNNs perform well and in which case we should see CNNs' advantage. In the light of this, this paper aims to provide some detailed analysis of CNNs. By visualizing the localized filters learned in the convolutional layer, we show that edge detectors in varying directions can be automatically learned. We then identify four domains we think CNNs can consistently provide advantages over fully-connected deep neural networks (DNNs): channel-mismatched training-test conditions, noise robustness, distant speech recognition, and low-footprint models. For distant speech recognition, a CNN trained on 1000 hours of Kinect distant speech data obtains relative 4% word error rate reduction (WERR) over a DNN of a similar size. To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus so far reported in the literature for CNNs to show its effectiveness. Lastly, we establish that the CNN structure combined with maxout units is the most effective model under small-sizing constraints for the purpose of deploying small-footprint models to devices. This setup gives relative 9.3% WERR from DNNs with sigmoid units.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178920","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178920.pdf","startPage":"4989","endPage":"4993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of convolutional neural networks for speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178920/","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of convolutional neural networks for speech recognition","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178920/","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361822","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of convolutional neural networks for speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052908S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7178921,"authors":[{"name":"Aanchan Mohan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Aanchan","lastName":"Mohan","id":"38469467500"},{"name":"Richard Rose","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Rose","id":"37085498228"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178921","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Speech recognition","Speech","Neural networks","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-lingual speech recognition","low-rank multi-task deep neural networks","multi-task learning","deep neural network multi-lingual acoustic models","DNN multi-lingual acoustic models","learning parameters","MTL paradigm","output layer","computational bottleneck","mono-lingual DNN","low-rank matrix factorization","weight matrices","original language-specific block matrices","low-rank language specific block matrices","LRMF impact","auxiliary languages","cross-language transfer","unseen language","transcribed training data","parameter reduction","lower memory footprint","training times","LRMF multi-lingual DNN","full-rank multi-lingual DNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-resource speech recognition","Multi-lingual speech recognition","Neural Networks for speech recognition","Multitask Learning"]}],"abstract":"Multi-task learning (MTL) for deep neural network (DNN) multilingual acoustic models has been shown to be effective for learning parameters that are common or shared between multiple languages[1, 2]. In the MTL paradigm, the number of parameters in the output layer is large and scales with the number of languages used in training. This output layer becomes a computational bottleneck. For mono-lingual DNNs, low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) of weight matrices have yielded large computational savings[3, 4]. The LRMF proposed in this work for MTL, is for the original languagespecific block matrices to \u201cshare\u201d a common matrix, with resulting low-rank language specific block matrices. The impact of LRMF is presented in two scenarios, namely : (a) improving performance in a target language when auxiliary languages are included during multi-lingual training; and (b) cross-language transfer to an unseen language with only 1 hour of transcribed training data. A 44% parameter reduction in the final layer, manifests itself in providing a lower memory footprint and faster training times. An experimental study shows that the LRMF multi-lingual DNN provides competitive performance compared to a full-rank multi-lingual DNN in both scenarios.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178921.pdf","startPage":"4994","endPage":"4998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-lingual speech recognition with low-rank multi-task deep neural networks","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-lingual speech recognition with low-rank multi-task deep neural networks","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361155","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178921/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-lingual speech recognition with low-rank multi-task deep neural networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054897S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178922,"authors":[{"name":"Kaustubh Kalgaonkar","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation"],"firstName":"Kaustubh","lastName":"Kalgaonkar","id":"37393939400"},{"name":"Chaojun Liu","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation"],"firstName":"Chaojun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37077659300"},{"name":"Yifan Gong","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888900"},{"name":"Kaisheng Yao","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Kaisheng","lastName":"Yao","id":"37712878600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178922","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178922","abstract":"In this paper we present a confidence estimation system using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and compare it to a traditional multilayered perception (MLP) based system.

Typical model-based feature enhancement employs a generative model approach. The enhanced features are obtained by using the weighted sum of linear transformations given by each Gaussian component contained in GMMs and corresponding posterior probabilities. The computation of posterior probabilities is a crucial factor for this kind of feature enhancement, and can also be formulated as the class discrimination problem of observed noisy features. The prominent discriminability of DNNs is a well-known solution to this discrimination problem. Therefore, we propose the use of DNNs for computing posterior probabilities. The proposed method incorporates the benefit of the discriminative approach into the generative approach. For AURORA2 task evaluations, the proposed method provided noticeable improvements compared with results obtained using the conventional generative model approach.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178926.pdf","startPage":"5019","endPage":"5023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature enhancement based on generative-discriminative hybrid approach with gmms and DNNS for noise robust speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178926","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Feature enhancement based on generative-discriminative hybrid approach with gmms and DNNS for noise robust speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362117","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178926/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature enhancement based on generative-discriminative hybrid approach with gmms and DNNS for noise robust speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084829S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178927,"authors":[{"name":"Shabnam Ghaffarzadegan","affiliation":["Center for Robust Speech Systems (CRSS), University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Shabnam","lastName":"Ghaffarzadegan","id":"38468178400"},{"name":"Hynek Bo\u015fil","affiliation":["Center for Robust Speech Systems (CRSS), University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Hynek","lastName":"Bo\u015fil","id":"37398877900"},{"name":"John H.

Our recent study has introduced a Vector Taylor Series (VTS) approach to pseudo-whisper sample generation which requires availability of only a small number of real whispered utterances to produce large amounts of whisper-like samples from easily accessible transcribed neutral recordings. The pseudo-whisper samples were found particularly effective in adapting a neutral-trained recognizer to whisper. Our current study explores the use of denoising autoencoders (DAE) for pseudo-whisper sample generation. Two types of generative models are investigated - one which produces pseudo-whispered cepstral vectors on a frame basis and another which generates pseudo-whisper statistics of whole phone segments. It is shown that the DAE approach considerably reduces word error rates of the baseline system as well as the system adapted on real whisper samples. The DAE approach provides competitive results to the VTS-based method while cutting its computational overhead nearly in half.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178927.pdf","startPage":"5024","endPage":"5028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generative modeling of pseudo-target domain adaptation samples for whispered speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Generative modeling of pseudo-target domain adaptation samples for whispered speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361333","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178927/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generative modeling of pseudo-target domain adaptation samples for whispered speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064863S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178931,"authors":[{"name":"Feifei Xiong","affiliation":["Project Group Hearing, Speech and Audio Technology (HSA), Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology IDMT, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37077604000"},{"name":"Bernd T.

Various system architectures are analyzed with a focus on optimal speech recognition performance. The system combining an MVDR beamformer and a subsequent MMSE estimator was found to lead to the best results, with relative reductions of 27.7% compared to the baseline system.

Supervised NMF systems make assumptions about the relationship between the activation and basic matrices that do not always hold.

Current state-of-the-art GIF methods are capable of producing high-quality estimates in suitable conditions (e.g. low noise and reverberation), but their performance deteriorates in nonideal conditions because they require noise-sensitive parameter estimation. This study proposes a method for noise robust estimation of the voice source by creating a mapping using a deep neural network (DNN) between robust low-level speech features and the desired reference, a time-domain glottal flow computed by a GIF method. The method was evaluated with two GIF methods, of which one (quasi closed phase analysis, QCP) requires additional parameter estimation and the other (iterative adaptive inverse filtering, IAIF) does not. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the QCP method with SNRs less than 50-20 dB, but the simple IAIF method only with very low SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178950","startPage":"5137","endPage":"5141","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178950.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise robust estimation of the voice source using a deep neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Neural networks","Signal to noise ratio","Databases","Training","Estimation","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","neural nets","parameter estimation","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise robust estimation","voice source","deep neural network","speech production","glottal inverse filtering","GIF methods","noise sensitive parameter estimation","low level speech features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voice source estimation","glottal inverse filtering","deep neural network","noise robustness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Noise robust estimation of the voice source using a deep neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178950/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15346705","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise robust estimation of the voice source using a deep neural network","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095837S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7178957,"authors":[{"name":"Petar Aleksic","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Aleksic","id":"37283468700"},{"name":"Cyril Allauzen","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Allauzen","id":"37283907000"},{"name":"David Elson","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Elson","id":"38227657800"},{"name":"Aleksandar Kracun","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Kracun","id":"37085617021"},{"name":"Diego Melendo Casado","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Diego Melendo","lastName":"Casado","id":"37085611779"},{"name":"Pedro J.

Some of the difficulties include potentially infinite vocabularies, low probability of contact tokens in the language model (LM), increased false triggering of contact voice commands when none are spoken, and very large and noisy contact name lists. In this paper we suggest solutions for each of these difficulties. We address low prior probability and out-of-vocabulary contact name problems by using class-based language models, and creating on-the-fly user dependent small language models containing only relevant names. These models are compiled dynamically based on analysis of the mobile device state. Since these solutions can increase biasing towards contact names during recognition, it is crucial to monitor false triggering. To properly balance this bias we introduce the concept of a contacts insertion reward. This reward is tuned using both positive and negative test sets. We show significant recognition performance improvements on data sets in three languages, without negatively impacting the overall system performance. The improvements are obtained in both offline evaluations as well as on live traffic experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178957.pdf","startPage":"5172","endPage":"5175","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved recognition of contact names in voice commands","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Transducers","Context modeling","Context","Training","Decoding","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voice commands","contact name recognition","mobile-device voice commands","challenging problem","infinite vocabularies","contact token probability","language model","false triggering","contact voice commands","noisy contact name lists","out-of-vocabulary contact name problems","class-based language models","false triggering","recognition performance","system performance","live traffic experiments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech recognition","voice commands","contact names","FSTs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improved recognition of contact names in voice commands","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178957/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361183","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved recognition of contact names in voice commands","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075479S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7178958,"authors":[{"name":"Ramya Rasipuram","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ramya","lastName":"Rasipuram","id":"38276085700"},{"name":"Marzieh Razavi","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland","\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marzieh","lastName":"Razavi","id":"37085622680"},{"name":"Mathew Magimai-Doss","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mathew","lastName":"Magimai-Doss","id":"38270198700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178958","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Probabilistic logic","Training","Speech","Vocabulary","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","probability","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated pronunciation learning","automatic speech recognition","probabilistic lexical modeling","phoneme based pronunciation lexicon","linguistic experts","crafted pronunciations","grapheme-to-phoneme","G2P converters","ASR system training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probabilistic lexical modeling","pronunciation lexicon","grapheme subwords","phoneme subwords","grapheme-tophoneme conversion"]}],"abstract":"Standard automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems use phoneme-based pronunciation lexicon prepared by linguistic experts. When the hand crafted pronunciations fail to cover the vocabulary of a new domain, a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) converter is used to extract pronunciations for new words and then a phoneme based ASR system is trained. G2P converters are typically trained only on the existing lexicons. In this paper, we propose a grapheme based ASR approach in the framework of probabilistic lexical modeling that integrates pronunciation learning as a stage in ASR system training, and exploits both acoustic and lexical resources (not necessarily from the domain or language of interest). The proposed approach is evaluated on four lexical resource constrained ASR tasks and compared with the conventional two stage approach where G2P training is followed by ASR system development.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics,

search (SS) method for the task of language independent query-by-example spoken term detection. One main drawback of conventional SS approach is the high miss rate for long queries. This is due to high variations in symbol representation of query and search audios, especially in language independent scenario. The successful matching of a query with its instances in search audio becomes exponentially more difficult as the query grows longer. To reduce miss rate, we propose a partial matching strategy, in which all partial phone sequences of a query are used to search for query instances. The partial matching is also suitable for real life applications where exact match is usually not necessary and word prefix, suffix, and order should not affect the search result. When applied to the QUESST 2014 task, results show the partial matching of phone sequences is able to reduce miss rate of long queries significantly compared with conventional full matching method. In addition, for the most challenging inexact matching queries (type 3), it also shows clear advantage over DTW-based methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178961","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178961.pdf","startPage":"5191","endPage":"5195","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Language independent query-by-example spoken term detection using N-best phone sequences and partial matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Language independent query-by-example spoken term detection using N-best phone sequences and partial matching","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7178961/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361930","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178961/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Language independent query-by-example spoken term detection using N-best phone sequences and partial matching","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082263S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7178964,"authors":[{"name":"Vassil Panayotov","affiliation":["Center for Language and Speech Processing & Human Language Technology Center of Excellence The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Vassil","lastName":"Panayotov","id":"37085745696"},{"name":"Guoguo Chen","affiliation":["Center for Language and Speech Processing & Human Language Technology Center of Excellence The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Guoguo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085662299"},{"name":"Daniel Povey","affiliation":["Center for Language and Speech Processing & Human Language Technology Center of Excellence The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Povey","id":"37284507300"},{"name":"Sanjeev Khudanpur","affiliation":["Center for Language and Speech Processing & Human Language Technology Center of Excellence The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Khudanpur","id":"37284474500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7178964","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":639,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":4002},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource description framework","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Blogs","Information services","Electronic publishing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LibriSpeech corpus","ASR corpus","public domain audio books","read english speech","training speech recognition systems","evaluating speech recognition systems","LibriVox project","language-model training data","pre-built language models","acoustic models","Wall Street Journal","WSJ","Kaldi scripts","frequency 16 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech Recognition","Corpus","LibriVox"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new corpus of read English speech, suitable for training and evaluating speech recognition systems.

When a query segment is given, our proposed STD method finds similar segments to the query from an utterance data set by efficient similarity search that traverses the double-layer neighborhood graph (DLG) with a low computational cost. The segment is a sequence of Gaussian mixture model posteriorgram frames and corresponds to a vertex in the DLG. A dissimilarity between vertices is measured by dynamic time warping. The DLG consists of two distinct degree-reduced k-nearest neighbor graphs in a base and an upper layer. The base layer's graph has all the vertices in the data set while the upper layer's graph includes only representatives extracted from the vertices in the base layer. By way of analogy, search in the DLG resembles driving on general roads and express highways appropriately for travel-time saving. Experimental results on the MIT lecture corpus demonstrate that the proposed method achieves CPU time reduction by 40% and more than 60% compared to the most recent method and the ordinary graphbased method, keeping almost the same precision.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","graph theory","mixture models","query processing","set theory","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-layer neighborhood graph based similarity search","fast query-by-example spoken term detection","double-layer neighborhood graph index","STD method","query segment","utterance data set","DLG","low computational cost","Gaussian mixture model posteriorgram frames","dissimilarity measurement","dynamic time warping","degree-reduced k-nearest neighbor graphs","base layer","upper layer","travel-time saving","MIT lecture corpus","CPU time reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spoken term detection","Query-by-example search","Search index","Neighborhood graph","Dynamic time warping"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178966","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178966.pdf","startPage":"5216","endPage":"5220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double-layer neighborhood graph based similarity search for fast query-by-example spoken term detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7178966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Double-layer neighborhood graph based similarity search for fast query-by-example spoken term detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178966/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178966/","accessionNumber":"15361700","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-layer neighborhood graph based similarity search for fast query-by-example spoken term detection","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064822S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7178970,"authors":[{"name":"Guoguo Chen","affiliation":["Google, MTV","Center for Language and Speech Processing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD"],"firstName":"Guoguo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085662299"},{"name":"Carolina Parada","affiliation":["Google Inc., Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Carolina","lastName":"Parada","id":"37593707400"},{"name":"Tara N.

With clean speech, we achieve 86% relative false rejection rate reduction at 0.5% false alarm rate when compared to a competitive phoneme posteriorgram with dynamic time warping KWS system, while the reduction in the presence of babble noise is 67%.

As further data is collected, generic policies can be adapted to give in-domain performance. Using Gaussian process-based reinforcement learning, it is shown that within this framework generic policies can be constructed which provide acceptable user performance, and better performance than can be obtained using under-trained domain specific policies. It is also shown that as sufficient in-domain data becomes available, it is possible to seamlessly improve performance, without subjecting users to unacceptable behaviour during the adaptation period and without limiting the final performance compared to policies trained from scratch.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178997","startPage":"5371","endPage":"5375","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07178997.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed dialogue policies for multi-domain statistical dialogue management","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Training data","Limiting","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","interactive systems","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical distributed dialogue policies","multidomain statistical dialogue management","learning policies","generic policies","Gaussian process-based reinforcement learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["open-domain","multi-domain","dialogue systems","POMDP","Gaussian process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7178997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed dialogue policies for multi-domain statistical dialogue management","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7178997/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361455","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed dialogue policies for multi-domain statistical dialogue management","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057917S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7178997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7179000,"authors":[{"name":"Yuuki Tachioka","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuuki","lastName":"Tachioka","id":"37077374000"},{"name":"Shinji Watanabe","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Cambridge, MA, US"],"firstName":"Shinji","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37280302500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7179000","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":153},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179000","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Yttrium","Training","Laboratories","Mathematical model","Irrigation","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","entropy","natural language processing","recurrent neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network language models","RNN-LM","word context","n-gram language model","automatic speech recognition","ASR","cross entropy","acoustic models","discriminative language models","DLM","discriminative training method","continuous speech recognition task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition","recurrent neural network","language model","discriminative criterion","log-likelihood ratio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179000","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179000.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","startPage":"5386","endPage":"5390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative method for recurrent neural network language models","abstract":"A recurrent neural network language model (RNN-LM) can use a long word context more than can an n-gram language model, and its effective has recently been shown in its accomplishment of automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. However, the training criteria of RNN-LM are based on cross entropy (CE) between predicted and reference words. In addition, unlike the discriminative training of acoustic models and discriminative language models (DLM), these criteria do not explicitly consider discriminative criteria calculated from ASR hypotheses and references. This paper proposes a discriminative training method for RNN-LM by additionally considering a discriminative criterion to CE. We use the log-likelihood ratio of the ASR hypotheses and references as an discriminative criterion. The proposed training criterion emphasizes the effect of improperly recognized words relatively compared to the effect of correct words, which are discounted in training. Experiments on a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition task show that our proposed method improves the RNN-LM baseline. In addition, combining the proposed discriminative RNN-LM and DLM further shows its effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179000/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15361309","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179000/","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Discriminative method for recurrent neural network language models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative method for recurrent neural network language models","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122171S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7179001,"authors":[{"name":"Will Williams","affiliation":["Cantab Research, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Will","lastName":"Williams","id":"37085563938"},{"name":"Niranjani Prasad","affiliation":["Cantab Research, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Niranjani","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37085560131"},{"name":"David Mrva","affiliation":["Cantab Research, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Mrva","id":"37284497400"},{"name":"Tom Ash","affiliation":["Cantab Research, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Ash","id":"37085561128"},{"name":"Tony Robinson","affiliation":["Cantab Research, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Robinson","id":"37089114394"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7179001","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computational modeling","Recurrent neural networks","Graphics processing units","Benchmark testing","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","language translation","prediction theory","recurrent neural nets","speech recognition","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scaling recurrent neural network language model","RNNLM scaling properties","GPU","RNN","n-gram model","word error rate","ASR","machine translation","word prediction","speech recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["recurrent neural network","language modelling","GPU","speech recognition","RNNLM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179001","abstract":"This paper investigates the scaling properties of Recurrent Neural Network Language Models (RNNLMs).

Previously, we have shown that RNNLMs with a full (non-classed) output layer (F-RNNLMs) can be trained efficiently using a GPU giving a large reduction in training time over conventional class-based models (C-RNNLMs) on a standard CPU. However, since test-time RNNLM evaluation is often performed entirely on a CPU, standard F-RNNLMs are inefficient since the entire output layer needs to be calculated for normalisation. In this paper, it is demonstrated that C-RNNLMs can be efficiently trained on a GPU, using our spliced sentence bunch technique which allows good CPU test-time performance (42\u00d7 speedup over F-RNNLM). Furthermore, the performance of different classing approaches is investigated. We also examine the use of variance regularisation of the softmax denominator for F-RNNLMs and show that it allows F-RNNLMs to be efficiently used in test (56\u00d7 speedup on a CPU). Finally the use of two GPUs for F-RNNLM training using pipelining is described and shown to give a reduction in training time over a single GPU by a factor of 1.6\u00d7.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179003","startPage":"5401","endPage":"5405","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179003.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the training and evaluation efficiency of recurrent neural network language models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Pipeline processing","Indexes","Data structures","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","natural language processing","pipeline processing","recurrent neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network language model","speech recognition","GPU","training time reduction","class-based model","CPU","test-time RNNLM evaluation","C-RNNLM","spliced sentence bunch technique","variance regularisation","softmax denominator","F-RNNLM","pipelining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["language models","recurrent neural network","GPU","speech recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving the training and evaluation efficiency of recurrent neural network language models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179003/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361664","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the training and evaluation efficiency of recurrent neural network language models","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072422S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7179004,"authors":[{"name":"X.

This impacts both the training and testing speed, especially when a large output vocabulary is used. To address this problem, noise contrastive estimation (NCE) is explored in RNNLM training. NCE does not require the above normalization during both training and testing. It is insensitive to the output layer size.

Accordingly, model training must be modified to encourage scores to sum close to 1.

In recurrent neural networks (RNNs), contextual information from past inputs is modeled with the help of recurrent connections at the hidden layer, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are RNNs that contain units that can store values for arbitrary amounts of time. While conventional unidirectional networks predict outputs from only past inputs, one can build bidirectional networks that also condition on future inputs. In this paper, we propose applying bidirectional RNNs and LSTM neural networks to language modeling for speech recognition. We discuss issues that arise when utilizing bidirectional models for speech, and compare unidirectional and bidirectional models on an English Broadcast News transcription task. We find that bidirectional RNNs significantly outperform unidirectional RNNs, but bidirectional LSTMs do not provide any further gain over their unidirectional counterparts.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179007.pdf","startPage":"5421","endPage":"5425","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional recurrent neural network language models for automatic speech recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Recurrent neural networks","Training","Speech recognition","Logic gates","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","recurrent neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional recurrent neural network language model","automatic speech recognition","RNN","long short-term memory neural network","LSTM neural network","english broadcast news transcription task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Language modeling","recurrent neural networks","long short term memory","bidirectional neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional recurrent neural network language models for automatic speech recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179007/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361339","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional recurrent neural network language models for automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071532S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179019,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The proposed detector is illustrated using a large recent dataset of Internet backbone traffic from the MAWI archive, and compared against existing detectors.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179029","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179029.pdf","startPage":"5530","endPage":"5534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random projection and multiscale wavelet leader based anomaly detection and address identification in internet traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179029/","displayDocTitle":"Random projection and multiscale wavelet leader based anomaly detection and address identification in internet traffic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15362184","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179029/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random projection and multiscale wavelet leader based anomaly detection and address identification in internet traffic","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070385S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179036,"authors":[{"name":"Qingchao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Qingchao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085511231"},{"name":"Bo Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085458590"},{"name":"Karl Woodbridge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Woodbridge","id":"37273033700"},{"name":"Kevin Chetty","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Chetty","id":"37297837700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7179036","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar tracking","Target tracking","Passive radar","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Doppler effect","Particle filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","importance sampling","indoor navigation","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","particle filtering (numerical methods)","passive radar","target tracking","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIR particle filter","tracking filters","sequential importance resampling particle filter","extended Kalman filter","Doppler resolution passive radar","indoor passive Wi-Fi tracking methods","Doppler resolution passive Wi-Fi radar","indoor target tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive Wi-Fi Radar","Indoor Tracking","Doppler","Kalman Filter","Particle Filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179036","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179036","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"This paper describes two Doppler only indoor passive Wi-Fi tracking methods based on high Doppler resolution passive radar.

This can use a collaborative spectrum sensing approach to detect the spectrum holes. However, this nature of the collaborative mechanism is vulnerable to security attacks and faulty observations communicated by the opportunistic users (secondary users). Detecting such malicious users in CR networks is challenging as the pattern of malicious behavior is unknown apriori. In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to detect those malicious users, utilizing the pattern of their historic behavior. Our evaluation reveals that the proposed scheme effectively detects the malicious data in the system and provides a robust framework for CR to operate in this environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern based anomalous user detection in cognitive radio networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179044","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179044.pdf","startPage":"5605","endPage":"5609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Pattern based anomalous user detection in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179044/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15346629","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern based anomalous user detection in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079726S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179053,"authors":[{"name":"John D.

For this reason, a-priori knowledge is crucial for improving the performance of the deconvolution. In this paper we show that combining non-negativity constraints with an upper bound on the magnitude of each pixel in the image can significantly improve the image formation algorithm. We also show that the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) dirty image provides the tightest upper bound out of all beamformers. We then show how the LS-MVI image formation algorithm can be reformulated as a preconditioned weighted least squares algorithm. The resulting algorithm can be efficiently solved using the active-set method. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in simulation and compared with constrained least squares based on the classical dirty image.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179056","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179056.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179056","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","startPage":"5664","endPage":"5668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally efficient radio astronomical image formation using constrained least squares and and the MVDR beamformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient radio astronomical image formation using constrained least squares and and the MVDR beamformer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179056/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361902","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient radio astronomical image formation using constrained least squares and and the MVDR beamformer","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070172S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7179057,"authors":[{"name":"David Ram\u00edrez","affiliation":["Signal and System Theory Group, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ram\u00edrez","id":"37605153600"},{"name":"Peter J.

The main novelty of the proposed detector in comparison to most known detectors is that it is based on sound statistical principles for detecting cyclostationary signals. In particular, the proposed detector is (asymptotically) the locally most powerful invariant test, i.e. the best invariant detector for low signal-to-noise ratios. The derivation is based on two main ideas: the relationship between a scalar-valued cyclostationary signal and a vector-valued wide-sense stationary signal, and Wijsman's theorem. Moreover, using the spectral representation for the cyclostationary time series, the detector has an insightful interpretation, and implementation, as the broadband coherence between frequencies that are separated by multiples of the cycle frequency. Finally, simulations confirm that the proposed detector performs better than previous approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15346615","htmlLink":"/document/7179057/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"An asymptotic LMPI test for cyclostationarity detection with application to cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asymptotic LMPI test for cyclostationarity detection with application to cognitive radio","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069805S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179059,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Mestre","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Mestre","id":"37284392300"},{"name":"Pascal Vallet","affiliation":["Institut Polytechnique de Bordeaux (ENSEIRB-MATMECA), Bordeux, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Vallet","id":"37645073400"},{"name":"Walid Hachem","affiliation":["CNRS/Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Hachem","id":"37272067300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7179059","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Coherence","Convergence","Correlation","Random variables","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","signal processing","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic analysis","linear spectral statistics","sample coherence matrix","correlation testing","multiple Gaussian signal","eigenvalue","generalized likelihood ratio test","GLRT","locally most powerful invariant test","LMPIT","Frobenius norm","associated central limit theorem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherence matrix","correlation test","random matrix theory","central limit theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179059","abstract":"Correlation tests of multiple Gaussian signals are typically formulated as linear spectral statistics on the eigenvalues of the sample coherence matrix.

In this paper, the asymptotic behavior of general linear spectral statistics is analyzed assuming that both the sample size and the observation dimension increase without bound at the same rate. More specifically, almost sure convergence of a general class of linear spectral statistics is established, and an associated central limit theorem is formulated. These asymptotic results are shown to provide an accurate statistical description of the behavior of the GLRT and the LMPIT in situations where the sample size and the observation dimension are both large but comparable in magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179059","startPage":"5679","endPage":"5683","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179059.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of linear spectral statistics of the sample coherence matrix","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of linear spectral statistics of the sample coherence matrix","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179059/","accessionNumber":"15361137","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179059/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic analysis of linear spectral statistics of the sample coherence matrix","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044786S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7179069,"authors":[{"name":"Jesper Jensen","affiliation":["Oticon A/S, 2765 Sm\u00f8rum, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper","lastName":"Jensen"},{"name":"Michael Syskind Pedersen","affiliation":["Oticon A/S, 2765 Sm\u00f8rum, Denmark"],"firstName":"Michael Syskind","lastName":"Pedersen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7179069","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Ear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hearing aids","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamformer directed single-channel noise reduction system","hearing aid applications","multimicrophone noise reduction systems","maximum likelihood method","mean-square error","noise psd estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power spectral density estimation","multi-microphone speech enhancement","noise reduction for hearing aids"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179069","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179069","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"We study multi-microphone noise reduction systems consisting of a beamformer and a single-channel (SC) noise reduction stage.

In this paper, we present a novel audio indexing approach called Segmental Randomized Acoustic Indexing and Logarithmic-time Search (S-RAILS). S-RAILS generalizes the original frame-based RAILS methodology to word-scale segments by exploiting a recently proposed acoustic segment embedding technique. By indexing word-scale segments directly, we avoid higher cost frame-based processing of RAILS while taking advantage of the improved lexical discrimination of the embeddings. Using the same conversational telephone speech benchmark, we demonstrate major improvements in both speed and accuracy over the original RAILS system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179089","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179089.pdf","startPage":"5828","endPage":"5832","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmental acoustic indexing for zero resource keyword search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Segmental acoustic indexing for zero resource keyword search","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7179089/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361213","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179089/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmental acoustic indexing for zero resource keyword search","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048035S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7179090,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Anguera","affiliation":["Telefonica Research, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Anguera","id":"37550606100"},{"name":"Luis-J.

The purpose of QUESST was to perform language independent search of spoken queries on spoken documents, while targeting languages or acoustic conditions for which very few speech resources are available. This evaluation investigated for the first time the performance of query-by-example search against morphological and morpho-syntactic variability, requiring participants to match variants of a spoken query in several languages of different morphological complexity. Another novelty is the use of the normalized cross entropy cost (Cnxe) as the primary performance metric, keeping Term-Weighted Value (TWV) as a secondary metric for comparison with previous evaluations. After analyzing the most competitive submissions (by five teams), we find that, although low-level \u201cpattern matching\u201d approaches provide the best performance for \u201cexact\u201d matches, \u201csymbolic\u201d approaches working on higher-level representations seem to perform better in more complex settings, such as matching morphological variants. Finally, optimizing the output scores for Cnxe seems to generate systems that are more robust to differences in the operating point and that also perform well in terms of TWV, whereas the opposite might not be always true.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179090","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179090.pdf","startPage":"5833","endPage":"5837","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QUESST2014: Evaluating Query-by-Example Speech Search in a zero-resource setting with real-life queries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"QUESST2014: Evaluating Query-by-Example Speech Search in a zero-resource setting with real-life queries","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7179090/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361481","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179090/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QUESST2014: Evaluating Query-by-Example Speech Search in a zero-resource setting with real-life queries","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005833.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051596S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7179091,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Sz\u00f6ke","affiliation":["BUT Speech@FIT, Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Sz\u00f6ke","id":"37864454100"},{"name":"Miroslav Sk\u00e1cel","affiliation":["BUT Speech@FIT, Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Sk\u00e1cel","id":"37085467947"},{"name":"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Burget","affiliation":["BUT Speech@FIT, Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Luk\u00e1\u0161","lastName":"Burget","id":"38469472200"},{"name":"Jan \u010cernock\u00fd","affiliation":["Vysoke uceni technicke v Brne, Brno, Moravskoslezsk\u00c3\u00bd, CZ"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"\u010cernock\u00fd","id":"37086864935"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7179091","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179091","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Europe","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["query processing","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel mismatch","query-by-example","spoken term detection technique","DTW metrics","calibration side-information","language identification system","QUESST2014 development"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["query-by-example spoken term detection","spoken document retrieval","acoustic keyword spotting","dynamic time warping","fusion","m-norm","logistic regression"]}],"abstract":"The paper investigates into Query by Example (QbE) - a spoken term detection technique with queries entered by voice.

We propose a continuous-time annihilation framework for a class of FRI signals. In particular, we show that FRI signals of sum-of-weighted exponential form can be annihilated by a composition of translation operators and show that the parameters of the signal can be estimated in the periodic non-uniform sampling (PNU) scenario. We discuss the advantages of PNU sampling over uniform sampling and extend it for general FRI signal sampling and reconstruction. Simulations are performed and the results are compared with state-of-the-art methods for signal-to-noise ratios ranging from -20 to 100 dB. An improvement in the estimation accuracy of 15-55 dB in terms of bias and mean-square error is achieved over conventional methods by a rearrangement of uniform samples to follow PNU sampling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Kernel","Sampling methods","Noise reduction","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","frequency-domain analysis","sampling methods","signal reconstruction","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-rate-of-innovation signal reconstruction scheme","time domain","frequency domain","periodic nonuniform sampling","FRI signal reconstruction","FRI signal sampling","mean-square error","bias error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite rate of innovation","periodic non-uniform sampling","continuous-time annihilation","annihilating filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179112","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179112.pdf","startPage":"5942","endPage":"5946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodic non-uniform sampling for FRI signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Periodic non-uniform sampling for FRI signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179112/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179112/","accessionNumber":"15346617","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic non-uniform sampling for FRI signals","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101627S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7179113,"authors":[{"name":"Tanya Chernyakova","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Tanya","lastName":"Chernyakova","id":"37077395400"},{"name":"Yonina C.

The structure of such signals, effectively captured within the finite rate of innovation (FRI) framework, allows for significant reduction in sampling rates, required for perfect reconstruction. In this work we consider ultrasound imaging, where the FRI signal structure allows to reduce both sampling and processing rates. We show that beamforming, a crucial processing step in image generation that generally requires oversampling, can be implemented directly on reduced rate samples. This is obtained by replacing the standard time-domain processing by a frequency domain approach and relying on FRI sampling techniques in frequency. Using this approach we achieve significant rate reduction while retaining adequate image quality for both 2D and 3D imaging setups using data obtained by commercial imaging system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Frequency-domain analysis","Radar imaging","Three-dimensional displays","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","medical signal processing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FRI signal structure","subNyquist sampling","medical ultrasound","finite rate of innovation","beamforming","FRI sampling techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array processing","finite rate of innovation","beamforming","ultrasound","sub-Nyquist sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179113","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179113.pdf","startPage":"5947","endPage":"5951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting FRI signal structure for sub-Nyquist sampling and processing in medical ultrasound","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting FRI signal structure for sub-Nyquist sampling and processing in medical ultrasound","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179113/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179113/","accessionNumber":"15361474","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting FRI signal structure for sub-Nyquist sampling and processing in medical ultrasound","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068675S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7179115,"authors":[{"name":"Sudarshan Nagesh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Sudarshan","lastName":"Nagesh","id":"37085444874"},{"name":"Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Chandra Sekhar","lastName":"Seelamantula","id":"37545336100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6997-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"7179115","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Shape","Ultrasonic imaging","Technological innovation","Electrocardiography","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FRI sampling","FRI reconstruction","asymmetric pulse trains","finite-rate-of-innovation signals","time shifted pulses","amplitude scaled pulses","FRI signal","signals frequently","ultrasound and radio detection and ranging","RADAR","modified annihilating filter method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI)","sampling","sum-of-sincs (SoS) kernel","asymmetric pulses","annihilating filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179115","abstract":"We consider the problem of modelling asymmetric pulse trains as finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals.

The use of ultrasound allows for producing very narrow audio beams, which finds application in a number of military and consumer scenarios. However, designing better parametric speakers has been hard: closed-form solution of the nonlinear wave equation for generic geometries is nearly impossible, and the only existing solution was derived for the simple case of a cylindrical beam. FDTD methods were considered not practical since the desired (audible) signal is orders of magnitude weaker than the ultrasound signal, and thus the noise floor (from the numerical approximation) will dwarf the audible signal. In this paper, we introduce a novel FDTD scheme that models nonlinear sound propagation for parametric speakers. By taking the difference between linear and nonlinear FDTD simulations, we successfully suppress the numerical noise floor and extract the audible signal. Both spectrum and radiation pattern of simulation match the measurements well. This offers a simulation tool for further research in creating advanced parametric speakers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7158221/7177909/07179120.pdf","startPage":"5982","endPage":"5986","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D numerical modeling of parametric speaker using finite-difference time-domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Mathematical model","Arrays","Numerical models","Acoustic beams","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic parametric devices","acoustic wave propagation","approximation theory","feature extraction","finite difference time-domain analysis","loudspeakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric speakers","very narrow audio beams","nonlinear wave equation","generic geometries","ultrasound signal","numerical approximation","audible signal","FDTD scheme","nonlinear sound propagation","nonlinear FDTD simulations","numerical noise floor","spectrum pattern","radiation pattern","finite-difference time-domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parametric speaker","array","FDTD","acoustic","nonlinear"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"3D numerical modeling of parametric speaker using finite-difference time-domain","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179120/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15361299","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D numerical modeling of parametric speaker using finite-difference time-domain","confLoc":"South Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0005982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084004S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7158221","isNumber":"7177909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7158221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7177909","articleId":"7179120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7179183,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In particular, the effects of silica filler content, pre-mixing method, co-stabilizer content and film processing on the large-area breakdown performance are analyzed. Nanostructural and film cross-sectional analyses are correlated to the breakdown responses. The optimum silica filler content is found to reside at the low fill fraction level (~1 wt-%) and automatic pre-mixing of the raw materials and the optimization of the orientation temperature are found to be preferable. The co-stabilizer Irgafos 168 is found to have a significant effect on the breakdown distribution homogeneity of the reference BOPP films. The breakdown response of the silica nanocomposites is found to be not only dependent on the active measurement area but also on the voltage ramp rate, indicating that the silica nanocomposites exhibit altered internal charge behavior under DC electric field. The area- and ramp-rate-dependence results exemplify the importance of careful breakdown strength evaluation of dielectric polymer nanocomposites. Above all, the results emphasize the fact that a thorough understanding and the optimization of the film processing parameters are crucial for achieving improved breakdown response in dielectric polymer nanocomposite films.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric breakdown","Films","Silicon compounds","Polymers","Nanocomposites","Voltage measurement","Area measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric breakdown","filler metals","nanocomposites","polymer films","raw materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polymer film large-area dielectric breakdown performance","filler content interdependence","biaxially oriented polypropylene silica nanocomposite film","self-healing multibreakdown method","premixing method","costabilizer content","cross-sectional analysis","breakdown response","raw material","breakdown distribution homogeneity","reference BOPP film","DC electric field","breakdown strength evaluation","dielectric polymer nanocomposite film"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dielectric polymer nanocomposite","polypropylene","silica","pre-mixing","film processing","breakdown performance","area-dependence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2015.004764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/7179123/07179183.pdf","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2015.004764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-area dielectric breakdown performance of polymer films \u2013 Part II: Interdependence of filler content, processing and breakdown performance in polypropylene-silica nanocomposites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large-area dielectric breakdown performance of polymer films \u2013 Part II: Interdependence of filler content, processing and breakdown performance in polypropylene-silica nanocomposites","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179183/","volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179183/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15364521","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-area dielectric breakdown performance of polymer films \u2013 Part II: Interdependence of filler content, processing and breakdown performance in polypropylene-silica nanocomposites","sourcePdf":"p2196-rytoluoto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113866S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7179123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7179123","articleId":"7179183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7179194,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Ultra-high frequency (UHF) detection techniques appear as the best choice if the goal is to detect PD online and to locate devices with insulation problems in substations and overhead lines. The location of PD is based on the determination of the difference of the time of arrival of electromagnetic pulses radiated by a source of PD to an array of antennas distributed around the monitored area. However, when measuring electromagnetic pulses radiated by PD activity many interfering signals, such as those coming from television (TV), global positioning system (GPS), wireless communication signals and others coming from electrical equipment distort the waveform detected by the sensors. Under these circumstances, the application of traditional techniques to estimate the time differences may fail. In this paper, the use Blind Source Separation (BSS) techniques applied to pairs of UHF sensors is proposed to extract the information of the difference of the time of arrival of the electromagnetic pulses radiated by a source of PD. The paper is focused on the application of the algorithm and the description of an experimental setup for controlled generation and detection of PD to verify the performance of the proposed technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical

In the demonstration, using our devised MIMO apparatus and carefully designed detection algorithm, we will show that we can achieve about 1.7 times higher data rate than single input single output (SISO) molecular communication systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Molecular MIMO communication link","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179319","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179319.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Molecular MIMO communication link","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179319/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15363073","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Molecular MIMO communication link","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p13lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038891S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179337,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37073332000"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"},{"name":"Wei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37555483600"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7179337","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1202},"abstract":"Channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) is required to fully exploit the advantages of massive MIMO. However, due to massive BS antennas, the estimation and feedback of downlink CSI are very challenging in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO. This paper proposes a block compressive channel estimation and feedback scheme for FDD massive MIMO, which can reduce the overhead for CSI acquisition substantially. Specifically, we first propose the non-orthogonal pilots, which is essentially different from conventional orthogonal pilots. Then, a block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm is proposed to estimate CSI according to the feedback signal from users, where the analog channel feedback is adopted, and the spatial common sparsity of time-domain massive MIMO channels is exploited to reduce the overhead for CSI acquisition. Moreover, we exploit the temporal common sparsity of channels to estimate channels with reduced complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme with significantly reduced CSI acquisition overhead can approach the performance bound.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179337.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block compressive channel estimation and feedback for FDD massive MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Matching pursuit algorithms","Antennas","Complexity theory","Compressed sensing","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","frequency division multiplexing","iterative methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel state information","base station","BS antennas","downlink CSI","frequency division duplexing massive MIMO","FDD massive MIMO","block compressive channel estimation","feedback scheme","CSI acquisition overhead","non-orthogonal pilots","block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","BOMP algorithm","feedback signal","analog channel feedback","spatial common sparsity","time-domain massive MIMO channels","temporal common sparsity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","FDD","channel estimation and feedback","non-orthogonal pilot","block compressive sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Block compressive channel estimation and feedback for FDD massive MIMO","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179337/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15347874","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block compressive channel estimation and feedback for FDD massive MIMO","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p49gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039842S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179340,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Yao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optimal Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yao","id":"37085570381"},{"name":"Kun Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optimal Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Yang","id":"38523864300"},{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optimal Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingyang","lastName":"Song","id":"37288632100"},{"name":"Yonghui Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279887100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7179340","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":322},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179340","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High definition video","Interference","Performance evaluation","Wireless communication","Computational fluid dynamics","Receiving antennas","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full duplex","half duplex","x-duplex","novel hybrid model selection method","HD","FD","antenna","receive antenna","transmit antenna","self interference","optimal mode","self interference conditions"]}],"abstract":"A novel hybrid model selection method between Half-Duplex (HD) and Full-Duplex (FD), is proposed in this paper.

In this paper, we propose a joint CSIT acquisition scheme based on low-rank matrix recovery to reduce the overhead. Particularly, unlike conventional schemes where users individually estimate the channel and then feeds back the estimated CSI to the BS to realize CSIT, we propose that all scheduled users feed back their received pilots directly to the BS without individual channel estimation, and then joint MIMO channel estimation can be realized at the BS. We further formulate the joint channel estimation problem at the BS as a low-rank matrix recovery problem by utilizing the low-rank property of the massive MIMO channel matrix, which is caused by the limited number of clusters. Finally, we propose a hybrid low-rank matrix recovery algorithm based on the singular value projection to solve this problem, which can provide accurate CSIT with low overhead as demonstrated by simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179354.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint CSIT acquisition based on low-rank matrix recovery for FDD massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Joints","Channel estimation","Training","Downlink","Uplink","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint CSIT acquisition","low-rank matrix recovery","FDD massive MIMO system","channel state information at the transmitter","frequency-division duplexing massive multiple input multiple output system","downlink channel training","uplink channel feedback","overhead reduction","channel estimation","singular value projection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint CSIT acquisition based on low-rank matrix recovery for FDD massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179354/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15347805","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint CSIT acquisition based on low-rank matrix recovery for FDD massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p83shen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048346S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179359,"authors":[{"name":"Bhaskar Prabhala","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Bhaskar","lastName":"Prabhala","id":"37085500213"},{"name":"Thomas La Porta","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"La Porta","id":"37283722800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7179359","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Semantics","Conferences","Prediction algorithms","Mobile communication","Trajectory","Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next place predictions","user mobility traces","user current location","location sensitive information","communication requests","service provider applications","mobile devices","periodic place-to-place transitions","atomic units","end-to-end user mobility trajectories","historical trace data","periodicity","aggregated average prediction accuracies","semantic information","trace data sets","place semantics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179359","abstract":"Collecting user's current location(s) and place-to-place transitions, predicting future destinations, equipping users with location sensitive information, and handling relevant communication requests are core ingredients of new generation of service provider applications on mobile devices.

In order to stop spammers, security companies apply blacklisting services to filter spam links. However, over 90% victims will visit a new malicious link before it is blocked by blacklists. To eliminate the limitation of blacklists, researchers have proposed a number of statistical features based mechanisms, and applied machine learning techniques to detect Twitter spam. In our labelled large dataset, we observe that the statistical properties of spam tweets vary over time, and thus the performance of existing ML based classifiers are poor. This phenomenon is referred as \u201cTwitter Spam Drift\u201d. In order to tackle this problem, we carry out deep analysis of 1 million spam tweets and 1 million non-spam tweets, and propose an asymmetric self-learning (ASL) approach. The proposed ASL can discover new information of changed tweeter spam and incorporate it into classifier training process. A number of experiments are performed to evaluate the ASL approach. The results show that the ASL approach can be used to significantly improve the spam detection accuracy of using traditional ML algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179386","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179386.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric self-learning for tackling Twitter Spam Drift","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Twitter","Feature extraction","Unsolicited electronic mail","Training","Market research","Security","Uniform resource locators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","social networking (online)","unsolicited e-mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric self-learning","Twitter spam drift","blacklisting services","filter spam links","malicious link","statistical features based mechanisms","machine learning techniques","ML based classifiers","ASL approach","classifier training process","ML algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric self-learning for tackling Twitter Spam Drift","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179386/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15347869","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric self-learning for tackling Twitter Spam Drift","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p208chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051705S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7179393,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Vettigli","affiliation":["Universit\u00e1 di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Vettigli","id":"37085493328"},{"name":"Mingyue Ji","affiliation":["EE Department, University of Southern California, CA"],"firstName":"Mingyue","lastName":"Ji","id":"38580848200"},{"name":"Antonia M.

However, achievable schemes proposed to date have been shown to achieve the proved order-optimal performance only in the asymptotic regime in which the number of packets per requested item goes to infinity. In this paper, we first extend the asymptotic analysis of the achievable scheme in [1], [2] to the case of heterogeneous cache sizes and demand distributions, providing the best known upper bound on the fundamental limiting performance when the number of packets goes to infinity. We then show that the scheme achieving this upper bound quickly loses its multiplicative caching gain for finite content packetization. To overcome this limitation, we design a novel polynomial-time algorithm based on random greedy graph-coloring that, while keeping the same finite content packetization, recovers a significant part of the multiplicative caching gain. Our results show that the order-optimal coded multicasting schemes proposed to date, while useful in quantifying the fundamental limiting performance, must be properly designed for practical regimes of finite packetization.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179393.pdf","endPage":"256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient coded multicasting scheme preserving the multiplicative caching gain","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179393","startPage":"251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"An efficient coded multicasting scheme preserving the multiplicative caching gain","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179393/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15347839","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7179393/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient coded multicasting scheme preserving the multiplicative caching gain","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p251vettigli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059503S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7179394,"authors":[{"name":"Abdallah Khreishah","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ"],"firstName":"Abdallah","lastName":"Khreishah","id":"37303999200"},{"name":"Jacob Chakareski","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Chakareski","id":"38521990200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7179394","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Collaboration","Energy consumption","Internet","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cellular radio","computational complexity","data communication","integer programming","linear programming","network coding","polynomial approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell coordinated system","Internet gateway","data caching","video application","cellular network","state-of-the-art caching scheme","base station","collaborative content caching capacity constraint","network coded data","network noncoded data","integer programming formulation","NP-completeness","polynomial time approximation algorithm","linear program formulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicell-coordinated systems","caching","collaborative caching","cellular networks","heterogeneous networks"]}],"abstract":"Cellular networks have become a major Internet gateway over which online video is increasingly accessed. Data caching in cellular networks brings the accessed content closer to the requesting clients, thus enhancing simultaneously the performance of the video application and the operational efficiency of the cellular network. State-of-the-art caching schemes for cellular networks either employ traditional approaches such as Least Recently Used (LRU) caching or optimize the cache placement at each base station independently. We study the problem of collaborative content caching among base stations such that their aggregate operational cost is minimized or the profit earned by the service provider is maximized, given their caching capacity constraints. We distinguish between two cases: (i) non-coded data in which a content item is either stored at a base station or not, and (ii) coded data, where segments of the fountain or network coded content item are stored at multiple base stations. For the non-coded case, we derive an integer programming formulation and prove its NP-completeness. We also design a fully polynomial-time approximation algorithm for solving the problem of interest. For the coded case, we derive a linear program formulation that can be solved in polynomial time. Our simulation results show that the proposed collaborative caching schemes provide considerable advances over non-collaborative competitors.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179394","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179394.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative caching for multicell-coordinated systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179394/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative caching for multicell-coordinated systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15363075","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179394/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative caching for multicell-coordinated systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p257khreishah.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048307S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179398,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Afanasyev","affiliation":["UCLA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Afanasyev","id":"37409695900"},{"name":"Cheng Yi","affiliation":["University of Arizona"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Yi","id":"38059695100"},{"name":"Lan Wang","affiliation":["University of Memphis"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280760100"},{"name":"Beichuan Zhang","affiliation":["University of Arizona"],"firstName":"Beichuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279404300"},{"name":"Lixia Zhang","affiliation":["UCLA"],"firstName":"Lixia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280169800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7179398","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":576},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["World Wide Web","Routing","Internet","Routing protocols","IP networks","Scalability","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scale NDN forwarding","named data networking","information-centric design","Internet architecture","application data namespaces","map-and-encap","secure namespace mapping solution","data retrieval","forwarding system","routing protocols"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179398","abstract":"Named Data Networking (NDN) is a proposed information-centric design for the future Internet architecture, where application names are directly used to route requests for data. This key component of the architecture raises concerns about scalability of the forwarding system in NDN network, i.e., how to keep the routing table sizes under control given unbounded nature of application data namespaces. In this paper we apply a well-known concept of Map-and-Encap to provide a simple and secure namespace mapping solution to the scalability problem. More specifically, whenever necessary, application data names can be mapped to a set of globally routable names that are used to retrieve the data. By including such sets in data requests, we are informing (more precisely, hinting) the forwarding system of the whereabouts of the requested data, and such hints can be used when routers do not know from where to retrieve the data using application data names alone. This solution enables NDN forwarding to scale with the Internet's well-understood routing protocols and operational practice, while keeping all the benefits of the new NDN architecture.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179398","startPage":"281","endPage":"286","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179398.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SNAMP: Secure namespace mapping to scale NDN forwarding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"SNAMP: Secure namespace mapping to scale NDN forwarding","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179398/","accessionNumber":"15347804","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179398/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SNAMP: Secure namespace mapping to scale NDN forwarding","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p281afanasyev.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060243S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7179411,"authors":[{"name":"Chengchao Liang","affiliation":["Depart. of Systems and Computer Eng., Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Chengchao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085452637"},{"name":"F.

scheme for OFDMA based wireless virtualization networks (WVNs). The scheme considers the time-variant wireless channel quality from the technical perspective, as well as the network benefits for WVN elements, e.g., subscriber user equipments (SUEs), mobile network operators (MNOs) and wireless service providers (WSPs), from the economic perspective. Regarding the available VR for a WVN as commodities, the utilities of SUEs and the network profits of MNOs and of WSPs are defined by using logarithmic type utility functions. Considering each of the MNO and the WSPs is willing to maximize its own network profit through the VR sharing, the VR allocation between one unique MNO and multiple WSPs is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve the problem, we first decouple it into two single-objective problems: the first is to maximize the benefit of the MNO at the supplier-level, and the second is to maximize the benefits of the WSPs at the consumer-level. By searching the equilibrium price of the VR market, the original multi-objective problem can be solved in the Pareto optimal sense. The convergence of the proposed heuristic algorithm and the effectiveness of the proposed VR allocation scheme are testified through extensive experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual resource allocation for wireless virtualization networks using market equilibrium theory","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179412","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179412.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Virtual resource allocation for wireless virtualization networks using market equilibrium theory","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179412/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15363063","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual resource allocation for wireless virtualization networks using market equilibrium theory","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p366zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093553S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7179413,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuhua Li","affiliation":["Dept.

However, it is envisioned that traditional dedicated networking equipment in mobile network operators (MNOs) cannot support the phenomenal growth of the traffic load and user demand dynamics, but consume unnecessary energy resource inefficiently. The emerging techniques for mobile content caching and delivery become more and more attractive, by which popular content can be cached inside mobile front-haul and back-haul networks, so that demands to the same content from users in proximity can be easily accommodated without redundant transmissions from the remote resource, thereby eliminating duplicated traffic significantly. While the incorporation between advanced cloud computing technologies and network function virtualization (NFV) techniques has become an essential issue in the evolution process of mobile systems, in this article, we propose the concept of \u201cCaching-as-a-Service\u201d (CaaS), a caching virtualization framework along with the development of Cloud-based Radio Access Networks (C-RAN), and the virtualization of Evolved Packet Core (EPC). Then we study the potential techniques related to the cache virtualization, and discuss technical details of caching virtualization and system optimization for CaaS. We carry out numerical evaluation on proposed framework and show significant improvement on the performance of reducing inter-MNO traffic load and intra-MNO traffic load.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Caching-as-a-Service: Virtual caching framework in the cloud-based mobile networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179413","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179413.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Caching-as-a-Service: Virtual caching framework in the cloud-based mobile networks","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179413/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15363035","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching-as-a-Service: Virtual caching framework in the cloud-based mobile networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p372li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073256S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179414,"authors":[{"name":"Qixuan Zhu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qixuan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085340665"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279333400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7179414","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Resource management","Games","Bayes methods","Mobile communication","Virtualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cloud computing","game theory","mobile computing","resource allocation","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian-game based power virtualization","spectrum virtualization","spectrum efficiency","mobile cloud-computing","wireless networks","wireless resource allocation","Bayesian Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless network virtualization","mobile cloud computing","power and spectrum allocation","Bayesian-game theory","spectrum efficiency maximization"]}],"abstract":"Mobile cloud-computing is a wireless network environment that focuses on sharing the publicly available wireless resources. Wireless network virtualization provides an efficient technique to implement the mobile cloud-computing by enabling multiple virtual wireless networks to be mapped onto one physical substrate wireless network. One of the most important challenges of this technique lies in how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to the multiple virtual wireless network users. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose the Bayesian-game based schemes to resolve the wireless resources allocation problem in terms of transmit power and wireless spectrum. We formulate this wireless resources allocation problem as the gaming process where each mobile user bids for the limited wireless resources from physical substrate wireless networks, and competes with the other mobile-user players bidding for the same resources. Since the bidding strategies for other mobile-user players are incomplete information, we propose the Bayesian-game based schemes to dictate the virtual users to request wireless resources based on the probabilities of these incomplete information. Our proposed game is guaranteed to converge to the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, where each virtual user optimizes their resources request actions with the consideration to actions of the other mobile-user players. The extensive simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian-game based power and spectrum virtualization for maximizing spectrum efficiency over mobile cloud-computing wireless networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179414","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179414.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian-game based power and spectrum virtualization for maximizing spectrum efficiency over mobile cloud-computing wireless networks","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179414/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15347864","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian-game based power and spectrum virtualization for maximizing spectrum efficiency over mobile cloud-computing wireless networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p378zhu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06428S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7179415,"authors":[{"name":"Heli Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecom., P.R.

To encounter this challenge, in this paper, we study the user association scheme in the Cloud-RAN SCN scenario.

Our rationale lies in exploiting the merits of parallel data transmission, which however may come at the expense of increased network utilization. The study of this cost-benefit trade-off underlines our work. Following a theoretical analysis on the benefits of partition-based caching over single replication caching, we propose three traffic engineering algorithms for assigning content partitions to caches and respective routes. Simulation results indicate that partitionbased caching can indeed improve average content transfer time (up to 65%) at the expense of a tolerable increase in network load (up to 25%), for moderate numbers of content partitions (less than 6), balancing at the same time network load better (at the level of 50%), compared to single replication caching.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179417","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7170114/7179273/07179417.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179273","startPage":"396","endPage":"401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partition-based caching in Information-Centric networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partition-based caching in Information-Centric networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179417/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15363058","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7179417/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partition-based caching in Information-Centric networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"p396sourlas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061379S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7170114","isNumber":"7179273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7170114","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7179273","articleId":"7179417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7179426,"authors":[{"name":"Weijian Sun","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Sicence and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Weijian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085422830"},{"name":"Xiaowei Qin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Sicence and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Qin","id":"37303945100"},{"name":"Shuang Tang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Sicence and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085403759"},{"name":"Guo Wei","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Sicence and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281335000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7179426","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Quality of service","Timing","Irrigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","quality of experience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoE anomaly detection","diagnosis framework","cellular network operators","key performance indicators","KPI","Quality of Experience","over the top services","OTT","KPI anomaly","quality of service metrics","network side instrumentation","WeChat video call service dataset","over the top services capturing and analyzing platform","OTTCAP","dual-cell high speed packet access plus network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer analysis","Pattern-based KPI","QoE anomaly Detection","Sequence Pattern Mining"]}],"abstract":"Traditional anomaly detection and diagnosis framework of cellular network is on purpose to optimize KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).

The importance of the sub-THz (0.1-1 THz) portion of the spectrum is recognized fundamental for many applications. In particular, the region around 0.22 THz is suitable for high data rate communications\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n and imaging due the low atmospheric attenuation window. However, high power is needed in this frequency range to provide a reasonable length of the transmission path. Vacuum electron devices represent so far the only viable solution for relatively output power at those frequencies. Wideband Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs) operating in the 0.22 THz range were demonstrated with relevant performance\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. The high cost of TWTAs still prevents their wide market diffusion. The double corrugated waveguide (DCW) is a slow wave structure of easy fabrication and assembly. A TWT based on the DCW is presented as possible affordable approach\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n. A relative high output power (3.7W) over a wide bandwidth (20 GHz) centered at 0.23THz was demonstrated, with 13kV beam voltage and 30mA beam current. The wideband performance is related to the superposition of the beam line with the dispersion curve over a wide frequency region. The optimization of the DCW dimensions is then a crucial step to assure wideband amplification. A study on the definition of the widest synchronism region is proposed. The aim is to extend the region included between the lower and upper cutoff frequencies of the dispersion curve and to control the its slope, maintaining a low beam voltage and suitable values of interaction impedance and losses.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber amplifiers","Wideband","Electron tubes","Optical fiber communication","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slow wave structures","terahertz waves","travelling wave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subTHz traveling wave amplifier","double corrugated waveguide","high data rate communication","atmospheric attenuation window","vacuum electron device","wideband traveling wave tube amplifier","TWTA","DCW","slow wave structure","beam voltage","beam current","dispersion curve","frequency 0.1 THz to 1 THz","power 3.7 W","bandwidth 20 GHz","voltage 13 kV","current 30 mA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PLASMA.2015.7179745","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Sciences (ICOPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Sciences (ICOPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7154561/7179488/07179745.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7179488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLASMA.2015.7179745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-THz traveling wave amplifiers based on the double corrugated waveguide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7179745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sub-THz traveling wave amplifiers based on the double corrugated waveguide","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7179745/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7179745/","accessionNumber":"15360782","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-THz traveling wave amplifiers based on the double corrugated waveguide","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"Abstract2P9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030657S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7154561","isNumber":"7179488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7154561","xplore-issue":"7179488","articleId":"7179745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"}]
