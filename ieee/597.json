In this context, we present a novel approach to adapt a healthy brain atlas to MR images of tumor patients. In order to establish correspondence between a healthy atlas and a pathologic patient image, tumor growth modeling in combination with registration algorithms is employed. In a first step, the tumor is grown in the atlas based on a new multiscale, multiphysics model including growth simulation from the cellular level up to the biomechanical level, accounting for cell proliferation and tissue deformations. Large-scale deformations are handled with an Eulerian approach for finite element computations, which can operate directly on the image voxel mesh. Subsequently, dense correspondence between the modified atlas and patient image is established using nonrigid registration. The method offers opportunities in atlas-based segmentation of tumor-bearing brain images as well as for improved patient-specific simulation and prognosis of tumor progression.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2163406","startPage":"25","endPage":"29","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6106028/05970097.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2163406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Modeling for Image Analysis of Brain Tumor Studies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tumors","Biological system modeling","Brain modeling","Adaptation models","Computational modeling","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical MRI","brain","cellular biophysics","finite element analysis","image registration","image resolution","image segmentation","medical image processing","physiological models","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale modeling","image analysis","brain tumor","healthy brain atlas","MR image","tumor patient","pathologic patient image","tumor growth modeling","registration algorithm","multiphysics model","growth simulation","cellular level","biomechanical level","cell proliferation","tissue deformation","large-scale deformation","Eulerian approach","finite element computation","image voxel mesh","nonrigid registration","atlas-based segmentation","tumor-bearing brain image","patient-specific simulation","tumor progression prognosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain tumor","glioma","image analysis","tumor biomechanics","tumor growth modeling"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Brain Neoplasms","Brain Neoplasms","Computer Simulation","Glioma","Glioma","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Models, Biological","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Modeling for Image Analysis of Brain Tumor Studies","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5970097/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425354","pubMedId":"21813362","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Modeling for Image Analysis of Brain Tumor Studies","sourcePdf":"tbme-bauer-2163406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101823S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6106028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6106028","articleId":"5970097","onlineDate":"01 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5970105,"authors":[{"name":"Qiangqiang Yuan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6163272/5970105/5970105-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiangqiang Yuan received the B.S. degree in surveying and mapping engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2006, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing.","His current research interests include image restoration, super-resolution, and remote sensing image enhancement."]},"firstName":"Qiangqiang","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37528295700"},{"name":"Liangpei Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6163272/5970105/5970105-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Liangpei Zhang (M'07\u2013SM'08) received the B.S. degree in physics from Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China, in 1982, the M.S. degree in optics from the Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, China, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1998.","He is currently with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, as the Head of the Remote Sensing Division.

However, as the TV model favors a piecewise constant solution, the processing results in the flat regions of the image being poor, and it cannot automatically balance the processing strength between different spatial property regions in the image. In this paper, we propose a spatially weighted TV image SR algorithm, in which the spatial information distributed in different image regions is added to constrain the SR process. A newly proposed and effective spatial information indicator called difference curvature is used to identify the spatial property of each pixel, and a weighted parameter determined by the difference curvature information is added to constrain the regularization strength of the TV regularization at each pixel. Meanwhile, a majorization-minimization algorithm is used to optimize the proposed spatially weighted TV SR model. Finally, a significant amount of simulated and real data experimental results show that the proposed spatially weighted TV SR algorithm not only efficiently reduces the \u201cartifacts\u201d produced with a TV model in fat regions of the image, but also preserves the edge information, and the reconstruction results are less sensitive to the regularization parameters than the TV model, because of the consideration of the spatial information constraint.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970105","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Mathematical

This paper is devoted to a numerical study on the capability of retrieving the thickness of the first layer of regolith as well as the temperature profile behavior from satellite-based multifrequency radiometers at frequencies ranging from 1 to 24 GHz. To this purpose, a forward thermal-electromagnetic numerical model, able to simulate the response of the lunar material in terms of upward brightness temperature (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TB</i>\n), has been used. The input parameters of the forward model have been set after a detailed investigation of the scientific literature and available measurements. Different choices of input parameters are possible, and their selection is carefully discussed. By exploiting a Monte Carlo approach to generate a synthetic data set of forward-model simulations, a physically based inversion methodology has been developed using a neural network technique. The latter has been designed to perform, from multifrequency \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TB</i>\n's, the temperature estimation at the lunar surface, the discrimination of the subsurface material type, and the estimate of the near-surface regolith thickness. Results indicate that, within the simplified scenarios obtained by interposing strata of rock, ice, and regolith, the probability of detection of the presence of discontinuities beneath the lunar crust is on the order of 84%. The estimation uncertainty of the near-surface regolith thickness estimation ranges from 11 to 81 cm, whereas for the surface temperature, its estimation uncertainty ranges from about 1.5 K to 3 K, conditioned to the choice of radiometric frequencies and noise levels.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2160351","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5997355/05970116.pdf","startPage":"3350","endPage":"3358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2160351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5997355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lunar Microwave Brightness Temperature: Model Interpretation and Inversion of Spaceborne Multifrequency Observations by a Neural Network Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Lunar Microwave Brightness Temperature: Model Interpretation and Inversion of Spaceborne Multifrequency Observations by a Neural Network Approach","volume":"49","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206695","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5970116/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lunar Microwave Brightness Temperature: Model Interpretation and Inversion of Spaceborne Multifrequency Observations by a Neural Network Approach","sourcePdf":"tgrs-montopoli-2160351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09594S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5997355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5997355","articleId":"5970116","onlineDate":"01 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5970120,"authors":[{"name":"Jagruti Sahoo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6006621/5970120/5970120-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jagruti Sahoo received the M.Tech. degree in computer science from Utkal University, Bhubaneshwar, India, in 2006.

In this paper, we propose an IEEE-802.11-based multihop broadcast protocol to address the issue of emergency message dissemination in VANETs. The protocol adopts a binary-partition-based approach to repetitively divide the area inside the transmission range to obtain the furthest possible segment. The forwarding duty is then delegated to a vehicle chosen in that segment. Aside from accomplishing directional broadcast for highway scenario, the protocol also exhibits good adaptation to complex road structures. The main focus of the paper lies in reducing broadcast delay, which is an important factor for time-critical safety applications. Most importantly, the contention delay remains almost constant, irrespective of vehicle density. Mathematical analysis is performed to assess the effectiveness of the protocol. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol imparts greater performance in terms of latency and message progress when compared with contemporary multihop broadcast protocols for VANETs.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2159003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","startPage":"757","endPage":"770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2159003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006621","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6006621/05970120.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Vehicles","Safety","Delay","Roads","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","delays","mathematical analysis","radio broadcasting","road safety","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VANET","vehicular ad hoc network","binary-partition-assisted MAC-layer broadcast","emergency message dissemination","road safety","IEEE-802.11-based multihop broadcast protocol","directional broadcast","broadcast delay","time-critical safety application","vehicle density","mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active safety application","black burst","broadcast","medium access control (MAC)","vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Binary-Partition-Assisted MAC-Layer Broadcast for Emergency Message Dissemination in VANETs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970120/","volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5970120/","accessionNumber":"12213835","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary-Partition-Assisted MAC-Layer Broadcast for Emergency Message Dissemination in VANETs","sourcePdf":"tits-wu-2159003-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099097S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6006621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6006621","articleId":"5970120","onlineDate":"01 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5970123,"authors":[{"name":"Asghar Taheri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran","University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6144184/5970123/5970123-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Asghar Taheri (M\u201912) was born in Zanjan, Iran, in 1977.

The proposed flux search controller is based on adaptive gradient descent of motor flux value with fast response and easy implementation. A proper loss model of six-phase induction motor in conjunction with the proposed method has been presented. Stator frequency variation with respect to flux reduction is considered as a new aspect of fast flux search control. Reduction of the flux in the search control technique leads to an increase in stator frequency, and an error in core loss calculation occurs if the frequency variation is ignored. The proposed search controller greatly improves efficiency by reducing core loss as well as harmonics loss. The approach not only is easy to implement and adaptive with regard to parameter variations but also requires no additional hardware for practical implementation.

In the class of channels we study, we consider the effect of delays, Doppler shifts, and different angles of arrival and departure for each signal path. We explore the efficacy of techniques based on sparse signal recovery, which typically define a basis constructed using a finite quantization grid over the parameter space, and approximate the impulse response as a sparse linear combination over such basis. Our goal is to provide guidelines on the design of pilot sequences that are sufficiently informative (SI), i.e., those inputs that guarantee identifiability of system impulse responses that fit in the sparse model. Inputs that are SI provide minimal requirements for uniquely identifying the system response. However, a smaller class of inputs leads to good mean squared estimation error in the presence of noise and modeling errors, due to the finite precision of the parameter space quantization. To single out the class of robust designs, we provide a new metric, called localized coherence, in lieu of the so called mutual coherence, as a measure for ranking SI designs in terms of robustness to noise and to modeling errors.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2163399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6041052/05970134.pdf","startPage":"5353","endPage":"5368","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2163399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sufficiently Informative Excitation for Estimation of Linear Responses Due to Sparse Scattering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Sufficiently Informative Excitation for Estimation of Linear Responses Due to Sparse Scattering","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5970134/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288328","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sufficiently Informative Excitation for Estimation of Linear Responses Due to Sparse Scattering","sourcePdf":"tsp-sharp-2163399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142458S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6041052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6041052","articleId":"5970134","onlineDate":"01 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5970162,"authors":[{"name":"Oleksandr Panchenko","affiliation":["Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Panchenko","id":"37314356800"},{"name":"Jan Karstens","affiliation":["SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Karstens","id":"37688936400"},{"name":"Hasso Plattner","affiliation":["Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Hasso","lastName":"Plattner","id":"37396539800"},{"name":"Alexander Zeier","affiliation":["Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Zeier","id":"37320937600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-308-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-8138"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1092-8138"}],"articleNumber":"5970162","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Database languages","Search engines","XML","Data models","Syntactics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","database management systems","query formulation","query languages","query processing","search engines","software tools","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["syntactical source code pattern querying","sample code snippets","abstract syntax tree","search pattern","query formulation","surface programming language","database technology","source code query language","source code search engine","query execution","ACS tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["source code search","query-by-example","source code query language","abstract syntax trees","XPath","database"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970162","abstract":"While analyzing a log file of a text-based source code search engine we discovered that developers search for fine-grained syntactical patterns in 36% of queries. Currently, to cope with queries of this kind developers need to use regular expressions, to add redundant terms to the query or to combine searching with other tools provided by the development environment. To improve the expressiveness of the queries, these can be formulated as tree patterns of abstract syntax trees. These search patterns can be expressed by using query languages, such as XPath. However, developers usually do not work with either XPath or with AST. To shield developers from the complexity of query formulation we propose using sample code snippets as queries. The novelty of our approach is the combination of a query language that is very close to the surface programming language and a special database technology to store a large amount of abstract syntax trees. The advantage of this approach over existing source code query languages and search engines is the performance of both query formulation and query execution. This paper describes the technical details of the method and illustrates the value of this approach with performance measures and an industrial controlled experiment. All developers were able to complete the tasks of the experiment faster and more accurately by using our tool (ACS) than by using a text-based search engine. The number of false positives in the result lists was significantly decreased.","doi":"10.1109/ICPC.2011.31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPC.2011.31","startPage":"41","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th International Conference on Program Comprehension","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968117/5970145/05970162.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th International Conference on Program Comprehension","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precise and Scalable Querying of Syntactical Source Code Patterns Using Sample Code Snippets and a Database","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Precise and Scalable Querying of Syntactical Source Code Patterns Using Sample Code Snippets and a Database","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970162/","accessionNumber":"12145553","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970162/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise and Scalable Querying of Syntactical Source Code Patterns Using Sample Code Snippets and a Database","confLoc":"Kingston, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4398a041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075161S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968117","isNumber":"5970145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968117","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5970145","articleId":"5970162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5970166,"authors":[{"name":"Marouane Kessentini","affiliation":["DIRO, Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Marouane","lastName":"Kessentini","id":"37860450000"},{"name":"Wael Kessentini","affiliation":["DIRO, Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Kessentini","id":"37946532500"},{"name":"Houari Sahraoui","affiliation":["DIRO, Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Houari","lastName":"Sahraoui","id":"37270403500"},{"name":"Mounir Boukadoum","affiliation":["DI, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Boukadoum","id":"37276338100"},{"name":"Ali Ouni","affiliation":["DIRO, Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ouni","id":"37943734300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-308-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-8138"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1092-8138"}],"articleNumber":"5970166","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":797},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Genetic programming","Software","Complexity theory","Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Computer bugs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow analysis","genetic algorithms","public domain software","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design defects detection","source code","genetic programming","rule extraction","open-source systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["design defects","software maintenance","search-based software engineering","by example"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970166","abstract":"Detecting and fixing defects make programs easier to understand by developers. We propose an automated approach for the detection and correction of various types of design defects in source code.

The correction solutions, a combination of refactoring operations, should minimize, as much as possible, the number of defects detected using the detection rules. In our setting, we use genetic programming for rule extraction. For the correction step, we use genetic algorithm. We evaluate our approach by finding and fixing potential defects in four open-source systems. For all these systems, we found, in average, more than 80% of known defects, a better result when compared to a state-of-the-art approach, where the detection rules are manually or semi-automatically specified.

When their APIs evolve, developers must update their programs accordingly. Existing approaches facilitate the upgrading process by generating change -- rules based on various input data, such call dependency, text similarity, software metrics, etc. However, existing approaches do not provide 100% precision and recall because of the limited set of input data that they use to generate change -- rules. For example, an approach only considering text similarity usually discovers less change -- rules then that considering both text similarity and call dependency with similar precision. But adding more input data may increase the complexity of the change -- rule generating algorithms and make them unpractical. We propse MOFAE (Multi-Objective Framework API Evolution) by modeling framework API evolution as multi-objective optimization problem to take more input data into account while generating change -- rules and to control the algorithmic complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICPC.2011.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPC.2011.43","endPage":"265","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th International Conference on Program Comprehension","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th International Conference on Program Comprehension","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968117/5970145/05970177.pdf","startPage":"262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Framework API Evolution as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970177/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Framework API Evolution as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145568","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5970177/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Framework API Evolution as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem","confLoc":"Kingston, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4398a262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055358S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968117","isNumber":"5970145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968117","xplore-issue":"5970145","articleId":"5970177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5970192,"authors":[{"name":"Heidar Pirzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Heidar","lastName":"Pirzadeh","id":"37670319000"},{"name":"Sara Shanian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Laval University, Quebec, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Shanian","id":"38318489000"},{"name":"Abdelwahab Hamou-Lhadj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdelwahab","lastName":"Hamou-Lhadj","id":"37282690000"},{"name":"Ali Mehrabian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Mehrabian","id":"37297284600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-308-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-8138"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1092-8138"}],"articleNumber":"5970192","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970192","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase detection","Visualization","Psychology","Conferences","Resource management","Software","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program diagnostics","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stratified sampling","execution traces","trace sampling framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Trace analysis","program comprehension","sampling techniques","stratified sampling","execution phases"]}],"abstract":"Execution traces can be overwhelmingly large.

While there have been many works devoted to hop by hop secure communications, the issue of end to end secure communications is largely ignored. In this paper, we design an end to end secure communication protocol in randomly deployed WSNs. Specifically, our protocol is based on a methodology called differentiated key pre-distribution. The core idea is to distribute different number of keys to different sensors to enhance the resilience of certain links. This feature is leveraged during routing, where nodes route through those links with higher resilience. Using rigorous theoretical analysis, we derive an expression for the quality of end to end secure communications, and use it to determine optimum protocol parameters. Extensive performance evaluation illustrates that our solutions can provide highly secure communications between sensor nodes and the sink in randomly deployed WSNs. We also provide detailed discussion on a potential attack (i.e. biased node capturing attack) to our solutions, and propose several countermeasures to this attack.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275028/6009139/05970247.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"218","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2011.072611.100080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2011.072611.100080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing End-to-End Secure Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970247/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","displayDocTitle":"Providing End-to-End Secure Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlLink":"/document/5970247/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12216126","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing End-to-End Secure Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"205-tnsm1109-gu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093567S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"6009139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6009139","articleId":"5970247","onlineDate":"01 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5970354,"authors":[{"name":"Parul Shah","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Parul","lastName":"Shah","id":"37395453900"},{"name":"Srikanth T.V.","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Department of Electrical Engineering, Powai, Mumbai - 400076, India"],"firstName":"Srikanth","lastName":"T.V."},{"name":"S.N.

The performance have been extensively tested on several pairs of multifocus images and compared quantitatively with various existing methods.

We report the impact of the spatial resolution (SR), temporal resolution (TR) and quantization stepsize (QS) on the perceptual quality, individually as well as jointly. We found that the impact of SR, TR and QS can each be captured by a function with a single content-dependent parameter.

In the proposed method, for implementing fault location considering various types of faults, three staged RBFNNs have been developed. The first RBFNN is used for determining the fault distance from each power source and the second RBFNN is used for identifying the faulty line. To isolate the fault, the third RBFNN has been developed for determining which circuit breakers (CBs) that must open or close. The proposed protection scheme is implemented on a practical test distribution network.","doi":"10.1109/PEOCO.2011.5970384","startPage":"255","endPage":"260","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959843/5970379/05970384.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEOCO.2011.5970384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automated protection method for distribution networks with distributed generations using radial basis function neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Circuit breakers","Relays","Fault location","Neurons","Fault currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","power distribution protection","power generation protection","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated protection method","distribution networks","distributed generations","radial basis function neural network","fault location","fault distance","faulty line","circuit breakers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Protection","Distributed Generation","Distribution Network","Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN)","Fault Location"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An automated protection method for distribution networks with distributed generations using radial basis function neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970384/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12144773","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automated protection method for distribution networks with distributed generations using radial basis function neural network","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569418489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09045S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959843","isNumber":"5970379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959843","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5970379","articleId":"5970384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5970389,"authors":[{"name":"A.

PSO and chaos theory is hybridized to form a chaotic PSO (CPSO), which reasonably combines the population-based evolutionary searching ability of PSO and chaotic searching behavior. The coordinated design problem of PSS and SVC controllers over a wide range of loading conditions are formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem which is the aggregation of the two objectives related to the damping ratio and damping factor. The proposed damping controllers are tested on a weakly connected power system. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is demonstrated through the eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time-domain simulation. The results of these studies show that the proposed coordinated controllers have an excellent capability in damping power system inter-area oscillations and enhance greatly the dynamic stability of the power system. Moreover, it is superior to both the manually coordinated stabilizers of the PSS and the SVC damping controller.","doi":"10.1109/PEOCO.2011.5970394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEOCO.2011.5970394","startPage":"11","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959843/5970379/05970394.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated design of PSS and SVC damping controller using CPSO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated design of PSS and SVC damping controller using CPSO","conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970394/","accessionNumber":"12144783","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970394/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated design of PSS and SVC damping controller using CPSO","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569423895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057692S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959843","isNumber":"5970379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959843","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5970379","articleId":"5970394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5970400,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The well known proportional sharing method (PSM) is used to trace the loss at each transmission line which is then utilized as a teacher in the proposed hybrid technique called GA-SVM method.

Commercial ANSYS software for three-dimensional simulation of a 400kV polyethylene-paper cables with copper segments is used. The investigation yields numerical solutions for Fourier conducting heat transfer, continuity, energy, and momentum equations. Poor convection of air in conduit is shown to result in cable threshold temperature to be greater than that in conduit-less, other conditions being similar. Also results show that the longer the conduit, the lesser the acceptable ampacity.

The objective of this paper is to describe how a new method to solve the ED in power system is developed since HNN is the faster alternative method in predicting problem in ED. A new mapping process is formulated and how to obtain the weighting factors is also described in this paper. Then, a simulation algorithm is described to solve the dynamic equation of the HNN. To solve the ED problem, the power mismatch, total fuel cost and the transmission line losses along with their associated weighting factors are defined. The results obtained gives less computational time compared to the Lambda-iteration method. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the HNN computation performs significantly better than conventional method, Lambda-iteration method.","doi":"10.1109/PEOCO.2011.5970411","startPage":"346","endPage":"351","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEOCO.2011.5970411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970379","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959843/5970379/05970411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hopfield neural network computation as an alternative solution for solving economic dispatch in power system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970411/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hopfield neural network computation as an alternative solution for solving economic dispatch in power system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970411/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12144800","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hopfield neural network computation as an alternative solution for solving economic dispatch in power system","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569424981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113659S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959843","isNumber":"5970379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959843","xplore-issue":"5970379","articleId":"5970411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5970413,"authors":[{"name":"Soheil Ganjefar","affiliation":["Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5959843/5970379/5970413/5970413-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soheil Ganjefar was born in Iran, in 1971.

One of ordinary neural networks disadvantages is the need of off-line training for initializing their weights. Since the power system in transient mode is a non-linear system, its off-line training is very difficult. In this paper because of eliminating the off-line training, this problem will not exist.

Therefore, it is necessary to forecast the future load demand and expand generation capacity to meet the increasing load demand. This paper presents a methodology to determine the optimal location for installing a new generating unit in which the technical, economic and environmental aspects are all taken into consideration. The location that yields the minimum overall fuel cost, total emission and system loss is considered as the optimal location for installing the new generating unit. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed in the proposed methodology to solve the optimization problem.

Thus, finding radio networking solutions that can greatly improve energy-efficiency as well as resource-efficiency (Green Communications) is not only benefit for the global environment but also makes commercial sense for telecommunication operators supporting sustainable and profitable business.

Most of previous methods for small UAV model identification has limitations in deriving an accurate model with wide frequency spectrum, or the identification results rely on the selection of weight parameters.

The method proposed in this paper uses pseudo-random signal (PRS) as test signal in small UAV model identification experiment for the first time. By using PRS, a small UAV's modes can be stimulated sufficiently. In this method, we also combine the advantages of time and frequency domain identification technologies together by increasing the order of target models in time domain identification and then deceasing model order by using frequency domain identification.

Effective forecasting is important for reliability, electricity markets and transmission grids. It is however difficult in view of the intermittent nature of the wind generation. We previously presented a method of neural networks trained by extended Kalman filter. In this paper, the method of the neural networks trained by extended Kalman particle filter is developed to capture the stochastic feature of the wind generation. The key idea is to take differencing transformation on the wind generation since differenced data has the student t-distribution based on the data analysis. The method of neural network trained by extended Kalman particle filter is then developed. It runs several neural networks trained by extended Kalman filter in parallel, and dynamically weights them based on the particle filter algorithm. Because the forecasting accuracies can be volatile, the method of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic is used to model the changes in residuals to improve predictions. Individual predictions from each neural network are then statistically combined to form the final forecasting. To accurately estimate the confidence interval, the dynamic covariance matrices are derived based on the differencing transformation. The overall dynamic covariance matrix is calculated by statistically combining all the covariance matrices. Numerical testing based on EIRGRID and ISO New England data demonstrates the significant values of our methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970701/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12145386","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970701/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-term wind generation forecasting and confidence interval estimation based on neural networks trained by extended Kalman particle filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term wind generation forecasting and confidence interval estimation based on neural networks trained by extended Kalman particle filter","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07104S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5960742","isNumber":"5970529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5960742","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5970529","articleId":"5970701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5970769,"authors":[{"name":"Gangxiang Shen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gangxiang","lastName":"Shen","id":"38182069300"},{"name":"Qi Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37307122800"},{"name":"Shanhong You","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shanhong","lastName":"You","id":"37710407900"},{"name":"Weidong Shao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Shao","id":"37965135000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0882-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0881-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0880-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-2056"}],"articleNumber":"5970769","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated optics","Optical fibers","Optical fiber networks","Optical receivers","Optical wavelength conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-dependent spectrum sharing","neighbouring channels","CO-OFDM optical networks","CO-OFDM-based networks","wavelength indexing algorithm","spectrum usage","optical spectrum efficiency","wavelength assignment algorithms","first-fit algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CO-OFDM optical network","spectrum sharing","spectrum match factor"]}],"abstract":"For CO-OFDM-based networks, we develop an efficient wavelength indexing algorithm to maximally share optical spectrum between neighbouring channels through properly arranging lightpaths that have good match of spectrum usage as neighbours in the optical spectrum.

Our design is mainly based on the use of loop-based optical delay lines and fiber Bragg grating. The encryption process is achieved by delaying a pulse in the optical delay line according to the structure of the codewords. The number of loops is defined by the position of the pulse in codeword. We demonstrate that our implementation is less complex and more flexible than classical approaches such as fixed length optical delay lines. In addition, a performance evaluation using eye diagrams shows that our architecture is more robust against eavesdropping security attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970837","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05970837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An all optical configurable and secure OCDMA system implementation using loop based optical delay lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An all optical configurable and secure OCDMA system implementation using loop based optical delay lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970837/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12144905","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5970837/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An all optical configurable and secure OCDMA system implementation using loop based optical delay lines","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"ThA16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037966S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5970837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5970838,"authors":[{"name":"Amel Farhat","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Laboratory SysCom, Universit\u00e9 Tunis El manar, Le Belvedere, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Amel","lastName":"Farhat","id":"37967647600"},{"name":"Mourad Menif","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Laboratory SysCom, Universit\u00e9 Tunis El manar, Le Belvedere, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Menif","id":"37268447600"},{"name":"Houria Rezig","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Laboratory SysCom, Universit\u00e9 Tunis El manar, Le Belvedere, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Houria","lastName":"Rezig","id":"37297132800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0882-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0881-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0880-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-2056"}],"articleNumber":"5970838","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Optical receivers","Noise","Integrated optics","Optical fibers","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","code division multiplexing","m-sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral-amplitude-coding optical CDMA systems","super-imposed fiber Bragg grating","balanced detection","m-sequences","perfect difference codes","balanced incomplete block design codes","modified quadratic congruent codes","modified frequency hopping codes","multiple access interferences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical code division multiple access","Spectral Amplitude Coding","MAI","intensity noise"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the Spectral Amplitude Coding Optical Code Division Multiple Access (SAC-OCDMA) system using Super-imposed Fiber Bragg Grating (S-FBG) with balanced detection.

The use of the layered decoder in place of the conventional flooding decoder helps reduce by half the number of iterations taken in decoding. This in turn reduces the decoding latency, increases the decoding throughput, and significantly lowers the power consumption at the receiving ends of optical transport networks. We show by using the experimental data collected from a 4-ary rate-0.8 LDPC-coded NRZ-DQPSK modulation system that layered decoding indeed halves the required number of decoding iterations. We also show that, in the back-to-back configuration, even with a single iteration of layered decoding, one can attain a 7 dB gain in performance at the bit error ratio (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n when compared to using only the maximum a posteriori probability detector output based on the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970877","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05970877.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evaluation of high-speed optical fiber communication using nonbinary LDPC coded modulation with layered decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evaluation of high-speed optical fiber communication using nonbinary LDPC coded modulation with layered decoding","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970877/","accessionNumber":"12144938","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970877/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evaluation of high-speed optical fiber communication using nonbinary LDPC coded modulation with layered decoding","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"ThB34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063807S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5970877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5970883,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Kakande","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Kakande","id":"37403089800"},{"name":"Francesca Parmigiani","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Parmigiani","id":"37281529100"},{"name":"Radan Slav\u00edk","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Radan","lastName":"Slav\u00edk","id":"37267891400"},{"name":"Periklis Petropoulos","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Periklis","lastName":"Petropoulos","id":"37273613800"},{"name":"David J.

In addition, this paper proposes a new dynamic subcarrier allocation (DSA) algorithm. The monitoring window time technique is used where OLT measures the state of the ONU's queue instead of exchanging traditional report messages. As a result, the end-to-end packet delay of high and middle SLAs is less than 0.7 ms even if the ONU offered load is 1.0. The packet delay of the high priority traffic class regardless of SLA levels is however less than 0.6 ms. The total network throughput is 97% of total capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970941","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05970941.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS aware MAC protocol for OFDMA-PON","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970941/","displayDocTitle":"QoS aware MAC protocol for OFDMA-PON","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12158776","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970941/","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS aware MAC protocol for OFDMA-PON","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"TuB61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040227S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5970941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5970942,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Kanonakis","affiliation":["High-Speed Networks and Optical Communications Group, Athens Information Technology Center, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Kanonakis","id":"37296409800"},{"name":"Ioannis Tomkos","affiliation":["High-Speed Networks and Optical Communications Group, Athens Information Technology Center, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Tomkos","id":"37273562500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0882-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0881-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0880-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-2056"}],"articleNumber":"5970942","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":519},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical network units","Modulation","Passive optical networks","Bandwidth","OFDM","Integrated optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","OFDM modulation","passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAC issues","OFDMA-PON networks","TDMA-PON","optical bandwidth","dynamic bandwidth assignment","MAC layer protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive Optical Network (PON)","Medium Access Control (MAC)","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)","Dynamic Subcarrier Assignment","Adaptive Subcarrier Modulation"]}],"abstract":"The OFDMA-PON paradigm has recently emerged as a serious contender for next generation optical access networks. Its main characteristics are enhanced capacity, flexibility and scalability as opposed to current and upcoming TDMA-PONs as well as to the proposed WDM-PON concepts. In particular, OFDMA-PONs provide the opportunity for dynamically allocating the available optical bandwidth in multiple levels of granularity, both among different providers/services and users (groups of individual OFDM subcarriers can be arbitrarily assigned to different ONUs each time). Moreover, OFDM allows for adjustable modulation/bitrate on a subcarrier basis. It is evident that new challenges are imposed to the MAC layer and the associated Dynamic Bandwidth Assignment (DBA). This paper discusses all relevant issues and provides general guidelines for the design of an OFDMA-PON MAC layer protocol.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970942","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05970942.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of MAC issues in OFDMA-PON networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970942/","displayDocTitle":"An overview of MAC issues in OFDMA-PON networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12144988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970942/","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of MAC issues in OFDMA-PON networks","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"TuB62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042786S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5970942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5970952,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson Costa","affiliation":["S.

It is shown that the signal statistics at the decision circuit input is approximately Gaussian distributed for high LO/S power ratios. However, the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution that approximates the statistics of each symbol depend on the transmitted symbol sequence, especially for low LO/S power ratios, demonstrating the impact of the waveform on the statistics of the detected signal. Moreover, the signal statistics starts to deviate from Gaussian for LO/S power ratios below 17 dB. A semi-analytical simulation method (SASM) based on the Gaussian approximation for the signal statistics at the decision circuit input is used for performance evaluation of CP-QPSK system. The accuracy of the SASM is assessed for different LO/S power ratios by comparison with Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation results. The SASM shows good agreement with MC simulation results for LO/S power ratios between 6 and 30 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05970952.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of local oscillator-to-signal power ratio on the gaussianity of CP-QPSK signal statistics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Noise","Optical filters","Numerical simulation","Performance evaluation","Digital signal processing","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","Monte Carlo methods","quadrature phase shift keying","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase-shift keying","CP-QPSK signal statistics","local oscillator-to-signal power ratio","coherent-detection","polarization multiplexing","decision circuit","numerical simulation","Gaussian distribution","transmitted symbol sequence","semianalytical simulation method","Gaussian approximation","Monte-Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quadrature phase-shift keying with coherent-detection and polarization multiplexing (CP-QPSK)","Gaussian approximation","local oscillator-to-signal power ratio","signal statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Influence of local oscillator-to-signal power ratio on the gaussianity of CP-QPSK signal statistics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970952/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12144995","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of local oscillator-to-signal power ratio on the gaussianity of CP-QPSK signal statistics","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"TuC16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038027S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5970952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5970972,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Glesk","affiliation":["University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Glesk","id":"37271016200"},{"name":"Tolulope B.

Coherent single-carrier QPSK systems with polarization multiplexing (PolMUX) allows to attain an spectral efficiency of up to 4 bit/s/Hz. However, to guarantee a bit error rate (BER) <; 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-15</sup>\n adaptive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) equalization as well as outer FEC coding has to be included which results in less than 4 bit/s/Hz in commercial 40 Gbit/s systems. From wireline and wireless systems it is well known that larger symbol alphabets in combination with FEC coding (denoted as coded modulation) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can significantly enhance the spectral efficiency. However, in order to exploit the channel capacity of the fiber the modulation itself needs to be capacity achieving. In this contribution we apply capacity achieving constellations in an optical OFDM system and jointly design mapping and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for an iterative decoding scheme, namely bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID). The authors expect this coding scheme to be most appropriate for future optical transponders to utilize long haul communications close to channel capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970983","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05970983.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity approaching coded modulation in optical communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5970983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity approaching coded modulation in optical communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970983/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145019","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5970983/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity approaching coded modulation in optical communications","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"TuD12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052051S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5970983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5970985,"authors":[{"name":"Christine Tremblay","affiliation":["\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Tremblay","id":"37320371400"},{"name":"Alfredo Enriquez-Castillo","affiliation":["\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Enriquez-Castillo","id":"38273417600"},{"name":"Michel P.

Filterless optical networks are passive broadcast & select networks in which the need for agility is delivered by DSP-assisted tunable transceivers, and simple passive splitters/combiners are used for interconnecting the fiber links. The resulting network architecture is expected to bring about significant advantages, such as reduced installed first cost (IFC) of the network, ease of maintenance, and reconfigurability, as well as good resilience and multicast capabilities. In this paper, the filterless network design problem is defined for a wide area network (WAN), and a method based on genetic and Tabu search algorithms is proposed for designing long haul (LH) filterless networks based on the concept of \u201cfilterless islands\u201d. Filterless network solutions are then proposed for a number of core network topologies, and the main characteristics of the solutions are presented. Our results show that filterless solutions can be found for different WAN topologies and confirm that the filterless networking concept is applicable to optical core networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970985","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05970985.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filterless WDM optical core networks based on coherent systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Filterless WDM optical core networks based on coherent systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5970985/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145021","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970985/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filterless WDM optical core networks based on coherent systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"TuD14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075448S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5970985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5970996,"authors":[{"name":"Michael C.

Wireless access is another important trend (WiFi, LTE/4G etc.) but requires active outside plant (base-stations). Once electrically-powered (e.g. via renewable energy) outside plant becomes a feature of an integrated NGOA architecture, the question of whether the NGOA network can be adapted and optimised still further (e.g. location of cognitive radio intelligence, vertical handover, locality, caching/content storage etc.) needs to be explored, as well as the additional energy-efficiency savings available with respect to optimising green radio technologies versus low-energy photonics. In this paper, we discuss the issues involved in the optimised design of a hierarchical and converged fixed-wireless access network, focussing on the handover possibilities associated with heterogeneous wireless technologies and the impact on the optimised design of an underlying fixed optical access infrastructure.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05970996.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5970996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical wireless and optical access networking: Convergence and energy efficiency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Passive optical networks","Ultrafast optics","Optical fibers","Energy efficiency","Integrated optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","convergence","energy conservation","passive optical networks","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless access networking","node consolidation","all-passive infrastructure","PON","next-generation optical access networking","WiFi","LTE/4G","renewable energy","cognitive radio intelligence","vertical handover","caching/content storage","energy-efficiency savings","green radio technologies","low-energy photonics","fixed-wireless access network","optical access infrastructure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Next-generation access networking","wireless networking","energy efficiency","network convergence","passive optical networking","green radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical wireless and optical access networking: Convergence and energy efficiency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5970996/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5970996/","accessionNumber":"12145029","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical wireless and optical access networking: Convergence and energy efficiency","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"TuD35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091885S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5970996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5971002,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent W.

Throughputs of well over Tbps can be supported by the network, which is compatible with next generations of Ethernet at 100 Gbps. The big challenge is to engineer the free space optical wireless network in the presence of atmospheric turbulence and weather, so it will behave properly when interfaced to other wire-line networks

Furthermore, we investigate the same-capacity and same-bandwidth-efficiency transmission systems with 28GBaud and 56GBaud per-channel rates. The logarithmic step-size based DBP algorithm depicts efficient mitigation of chromatic dispersion (CD) and non-linear (NL) impairments. Benefit of the logarithmic step-size is the reduced complexity and computational time for higher baud rates.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971018","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05971018.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logarithmic step-size based digital backward propagation in N-channel 112Gbit/s/ch DP-QPSK transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Logarithmic step-size based digital backward propagation in N-channel 112Gbit/s/ch DP-QPSK transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971018/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145047","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5971018/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logarithmic step-size based digital backward propagation in N-channel 112Gbit/s/ch DP-QPSK transmission","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"TuP06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09511S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5971018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5971019,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Chochol","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Chochol","id":"37939716700"},{"name":"Josep Maria Fabrega","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep Maria","lastName":"Fabrega","id":"37409203400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0882-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0881-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0880-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-2056"}],"articleNumber":"5971019","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"abstract":"A frequency control loop for 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) optical coherent systems is proposed and demonstrated.

Moreover, it is demonstrated that FHT modulation is suitable for cost-effective unamplified and ASE-dominated optical OFDM systems. Low-complexity PAPR reduction techniques can be easily and efficiently implemented. Finally, the FHT is advantageously used in a phase modulated coherent scheme for implementing a 0 dB PAPR constant envelope O-OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971031","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05971031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FHT-based architectures for multicarrier modulation in direct detection and coherent optical systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FHT-based architectures for multicarrier modulation in direct detection and coherent optical systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971031/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145057","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5971031/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FHT-based architectures for multicarrier modulation in direct detection and coherent optical systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"WeA11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050725S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5971031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5971033,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriella Cincotti","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, University of Roma Tre, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Cincotti","id":"37272753700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0882-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0881-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0880-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-2056"}],"articleNumber":"5971033","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is currently attracting a lot of research interest within the fiber-optic community and a large number of scientific papers has been devoted to theoretically and experimentally investigate the performance of this technology.

In O-OFDM systems based on FFT, a direct implementation of PTS and interleaving techniques destroy the Hermitian symmetry. In FHT-based O-OFDM, all the proposed techniques are implemented and compared, showing that PTS provides the highest PAPR reduction.

conversion using a quantum dot (QD) based semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is presented. Cross-gain modulation and cross-phase modulation were both used to shift the wavelength of 40-Gb/s and 80-Gb/s return-to-zero on-off keying data signals at 1.3 \u03bcm by 10 nm. The ultra-fast gain recovery of the QD's enables open eyes of the wavelength converted signal with an inverted bit-logic. The slow phase recovery of the carrier reservoir of the QD's, however, leads to phase patterning which becomes evident after filtering of the converted signal with a delay interferometer, whose free spectral range is set to the bit rate. The phase patterning was mitigated by adjusting the delay interferometer to a large free spectral range. Moreover, the delay interferometer reinverted the converted signal and significantly enhanced the extinction ratio. Using such a wavelength converter scheme error-free (bit-error ratio <; 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n) performance was achieved for 40 Gb/s, as well as for the first time with QD SOAs at 80 Gb/s.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971089","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05971089.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifier for filter-assisted 80-Gb/s wavelength conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifier for filter-assisted 80-Gb/s wavelength conversion","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5971089/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145100","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971089/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifier for filter-assisted 80-Gb/s wavelength conversion","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"WeB54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057359S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5971089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5971098,"authors":[{"name":"Darli A.

However, the close-packed constellation of the 16-QAM modulation format also has drawbacks, such as an increased susceptibility to phase noise generated in the transmitter and local oscillator lasers. This paper evaluates basic phase recovery algorithms developed for DP-16-QAM systems, using computer simulations and the offline post-processing of experimental data. Special attention is given to joint-polarization algorithms, which use the phase information of both polarization orientations to jointly produce a single estimate of the phase noise, thus relaxing the requirements for transmitter and local oscillator lasers.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971098","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05971098.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint-polarization phase recovery algorithms for DP-16-QAM coherent optical systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971098/","displayDocTitle":"Joint-polarization phase recovery algorithms for DP-16-QAM coherent optical systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12158808","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5971098/","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint-polarization phase recovery algorithms for DP-16-QAM coherent optical systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"WeC12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043926S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5971098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5971099,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For long haul transmission systems coherent detection is beneficial compared to direct detection as it provides higher sensitivity. Though CO-OFDM offers a virtually unlimited tolerance against linear impairments, phase noise represents major challenge that must be compensated for. Thus, phase noise compensation (PNC) technique must be applied in the digital signal processing (DSP), which is already limited in speed and processing capabilities. Conversely, self coherent optical (SCO-) OFDM is an interesting alternative which does not require any PNC in the DSP. Furthermore, no local oscillator (LO) is required at the receiver. In this paper, an overview of the recently seen self coherent techniques will be given. Generally, self coherent detection is realized by sending an optical carrier along with the data signal like in direct detection systems. At the receiver, however, the optical carrier is extracted from the signal with the use of filters with very narrow bandwidth and used as an LO using heterodyne or homodyne detection. The performance of such a system depends on the filter bandwidth that is used to extract the carrier.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959844/5970761/05971099.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 13th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2011.5971099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self- coherent optical OFDM: An interesting alternative to direct or coherent detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","OFDM","Optical receivers","Optical polarization","Optical mixing","Integrated optics","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","heterodyne detection","homodyne detection","OFDM modulation","optical receivers","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-coherent optical OFDM","direct detection","coherent detection","optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","next generation","long haul data transmission","virtually unlimited tolerance","phase noise compensation","digital signal processing","optical receiver","optical carrier","signal filters","heterodyne detection","homodyne detection","filter bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","self-coherent","phase noise","Fabry-Perot tunable filter","optical communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Self- coherent optical OFDM: An interesting alternative to direct or coherent detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5971099/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145107","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self- coherent optical OFDM: An interesting alternative to direct or coherent detection","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"WeC13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11151S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959844","isNumber":"5970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959844","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5970761","articleId":"5971099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5971131,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Pittal\u00e0","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pittal\u00e0","id":"38524325800"},{"name":"Fabian N.

This paper presents the application of a variable mechanical stiffness control based on a human stiffness estimation. In the controller design, dual disturbance observers with respect to two operation modes, namely the common mode and the differential mode, are designed and applied for controlling wire rope tension and interaction force of human. The human stiffness estimation plays a dominant role in achieving this intelligent behavior, and smooth interaction force, by allowing a robot system to adapt the mechanical stiffness of the twin direct-drive motor system. The advantage points of the high mechanical bandwidth and low stiffness transmission are combined together. The experiment results from two separate experiments show that the above strategy was able to regulate the mechanical stiffness of the robot and provide a smooth interaction force.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable mechanical stiffness control based on human stiffness estimation","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971211","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5958192/5971182/05971211.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5971182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Variable mechanical stiffness control based on human stiffness estimation","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5971211/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12144437","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable mechanical stiffness control based on human stiffness estimation","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048308S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5958192","isNumber":"5971182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5958192","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5971182","articleId":"5971211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5971221,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet K\u0131rl\u0131","affiliation":["Mechatronic Engineering Department, Yildiz Technical University, A309 Istanbul, 34349 Turkiye"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"K\u0131rl\u0131","id":"37087685329"},{"name":"Do\u011fan Aydeniz","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkiye"],"firstName":"Do\u011fan","lastName":"Aydeniz","id":"37085948036"},{"name":"Vasfi Emre \u00d6m\u00fcrl\u00fc","affiliation":["Mechatronic Engineering Department, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkiye"],"firstName":"Vasfi Emre","lastName":"\u00d6m\u00fcrl\u00fc","id":"37265641400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-985-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-982-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-984-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5971221","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","System identification","Data models","Atmospheric modeling","Vehicles","DC motors","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","angular measurement","electronic engineering computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometer-based inclinometer","artificial neural networks","dynamic modeling","spatially moving vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modeling","System Identification","Neural Networks","Accelerometer","Inclinometer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971221","abstract":"In this study, dynamic modeling of an accelerometer based inclinometer is carried out.

Although this feature enabled researchers to represent outstanding engineering prototypes, the resulting large mechanical impedance output makes these robots inherently unsafe when interacting with humans. Moreover, the same issue also limits their abilities to safely interact with the environment and reduces their energy efficiency. In order to cope with these problems, we developed a compliant robot called cCub, as a part of the European project AMARSi (Adaptive Modular Architectures for Rich Motor Skills). Having completed the design and realization of the lower body of the cCub robot, we developed an integrated framework, including the compliant experimental platform, a simulation environment and a walking pattern generator. Furthermore, we also conducted real-time dynamic walking experiments on cCub demonstrating that dynamically equilibrated walking cycles can be executed in this new highly passive compliant humanoid platform.

Some examples of these maneuvers are: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), intelligent intersection management or automatic overtaking maneuvering, among others. One of the most important aims of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is to use roads without substantial modifications of the current infrastructure. The overtaking maneuver demands special attentions, in particular when it is carried out on two-way roads. For this reason, a fuzzy decision system based on fuzzy logic able to execute an autonomous overtaking in two-way roads has been implemented in this paper. The experiments are focused on the longitudinal control when an autonomous vehicle is overtaking to other. Moreover, different cases have been considered using an oncoming vehicle from the other direction on a two-way road. Several trials with three real vehicles communicated via a wireless network were carried out, showing a good behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12144505","htmlLink":"/document/5971279/","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Longitudinal fuzzy control for autonomous overtaking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Longitudinal fuzzy control for autonomous overtaking","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060968S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5958192","isNumber":"5971182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5958192","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5971182","articleId":"5971279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5971283,"authors":[{"name":"Ahsan Qamar","affiliation":["Department of Machine Design, School of Industrial Engineering and Management, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ahsan","lastName":"Qamar","id":"37890708900"},{"name":"Jan Wikander","affiliation":["Department of Machine Design, School of Industrial Engineering and Management, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Wikander","id":"37323559200"},{"name":"Carl During","affiliation":["Micronic Laser Systems AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"During","id":"37355473300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-985-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-982-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-984-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5971283","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Biological system modeling","Analytical models","Connectors","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","mechanical engineering computing","mechatronics","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechatronic system design","multidomain systems","SysML","system modeling language","Eclipse Modeling Framework","robot system","mechanical design model","Solid Edge","dynamic analysis model","Simulink/SimMechanics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design Infrastructure","Mechatronics","SysML","Design Methodology","Model Integration"]}],"abstract":"Mechatronic system design is contemplated extensively through model-based approaches. To reflect the multi-domain integration inside a mechatronic system during the design process, integration approaches targeting heterogeneous models are essential. An infrastructure supporting the design of multi-domain systems is presented. The dependencies between the domain-specific models are managed by utilizing SysML as a common system modeling language between those models. A model integration framework supports model transformations between the system-model and the domain-specific models by utilizing Eclipse Modeling Framework. Structural and parameter type dependencies between different domain-models are handled to provide consistency between different views. This provides an ability to traverse between different views of the system, as well as maintaining consistency between those views. A case study on a robot system is presented to explain the integration of mechanical design model in Solid Edge, and dynamic analysis model in Simulink/SimMechanics through a SysML system model, all under the proposed design infrastructure. The approach is scalable towards other modeling formalisms by building new relations through the SysML model. This will support: co-evolution of domain-specific models, a better design of multi-domain systems, reduction in modeling in-consistencies, and a reduction in design time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mechatronic design infrastructure integrating heterogeneous models","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971283","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5958192/5971182/05971283.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5971182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A mechatronic design infrastructure integrating heterogeneous models","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5971283/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12144509","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mechatronic design infrastructure integrating heterogeneous models","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075146S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5958192","isNumber":"5971182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5958192","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5971182","articleId":"5971283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5971285,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Punz","affiliation":["Institute of Computer-Aided Methods in Mechanical Engineering, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Punz","id":"37945305300"},{"name":"Peter Hehenberger","affiliation":["Institute of Computer-Aided Methods in Mechanical Engineering, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Hehenberger","id":"37824664400"},{"name":"Martin Follmer","affiliation":["Institute of Computer-Aided Methods in Mechanical Engineering, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Follmer","id":"37945304800"},{"name":"Klaus Zeman","affiliation":["Institute of Computer-Aided Methods in Mechanical Engineering, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Zeman","id":"37836970000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-985-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-982-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-984-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5971285","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Welding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer satisfaction","mechatronics","product design","product development","quality function deployment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer-oriented hierarchical concept development","mechatronic design","house-of-concepts approach","conceptual design","customer orientation","product design stages","quality function deployment approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mechatronic product design","conceptual design","hierarchical concept development","customer orientation","House of Concepts","Quality Function Deployment"]}],"abstract":"Especially in early product design stages, customer orientation - as, for example, supported by the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach - is essential for product success.

By making use of a slave-observer and Gaussian RBF Neural Network Based on Sliding Mode Control, the fault tolerant synchronization can be achieved. The adaptation law of designed controller is obtained based on sliding mode control methodology without calculating the Jacobian of the system.

The presented approach, which circumvents such bottlenecks, is especially useful in developing efficient neural network models when full-scale models are not available. This study illustrates the application of the method on a highly nonlinear hydraulic servo-system so to estimate accurately the chamber pressures of its hydraulic piston in extended time periods.","doi":"10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971305","startPage":"330","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5971182","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5958192/5971182/05971305.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term prediction of hydraulic system dynamics via structured recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971305/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Long-term prediction of hydraulic system dynamics via structured recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5971305/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12144531","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term prediction of hydraulic system dynamics via structured recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110815S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5958192","isNumber":"5971182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5958192","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5971182","articleId":"5971305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5971307,"authors":[{"name":"Fatma Zeynep Temel","affiliation":["Mechatronics Program, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Fatma Zeynep","lastName":"Temel","id":"37944884400"},{"name":"Serhat Yesilyurt","affiliation":["Mechatronics Program, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Serhat","lastName":"Yesilyurt","id":"37565049000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-985-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-982-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-984-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5971307","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":781},"abstract":"Untethered swimming microrobots have many advantages for biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery, simple surgical tasks including opening of clogged arteries and as diagnostic tools. In this paper, swimming of microrobots is examined in water and glycerin filled channels. Propulsion of microrobots is enabled by means of an external magnetic field that rotates in the axial direction of the channel and forces robots to rotate about the axis of the helical tail. Rotation of the helical tail resulted in a screw-like motion of the robot reaching speeds up to several millimeters per second for a 2-mm long robot. The results are compared with resistive force theory, which is based on the assumption that the propulsive force resulting from the rotation of the helix is proportional to the local velocity on the helical flagellum in low Reynolds number micro and viscous flows.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5958192/5971182/05971307.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"347","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5971182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetically actuated micro swimming of bio-inspired robots in mini channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Coils","Biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","electromagnetic actuators","force control","magnetic fields","medical robotics","microrobots","motion control","plastic flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["untethered swimming microrobots","magnetically actuated microswimming","bio-inspired robots","glycerin filled channel","water channel","microrobot propulsion","external magnetic field","helical tail rotation","robot screw-like motion","resistive force theory","propulsive force","Reynolds number","microflow","viscous flow","helical flagellum","biomedical application","size 2 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Untethered micro swimmer","magnetic actuation","helical wave propagation","medical robotics","resistive force theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Magnetically actuated micro swimming of bio-inspired robots in mini channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5971307/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12144533","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetically actuated micro swimming of bio-inspired robots in mini channels","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053592S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5958192","isNumber":"5971182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5958192","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5971182","articleId":"5971307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5971366,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Wireless System Research and Development, Marvell Semiconductor, Santa Clara, USA","University of Connecticut, Storrs, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407359000"},{"name":"Wei Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37955277600"},{"name":"Shengli Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, USA"],"firstName":"Shengli","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276854700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5971366","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"While existing works on rate-compatible low-density parity-check (RC-LDPC) codes, either binary or nonbinary, all focus on random-like construction, we in this letter present a novel method to construct structured nonbinary RC-LDPC codes.

For embedded and low power devices, speed and memory efficiency is of main concern, and therefore, there have been several recent attempts to improve these issues. In this paper, we are concerned with the early components of the object recognition pipeline, namely, feature detection, feature description, and feature tracking. In particular, we propose a novel approach to speed up feature detectors and to inform feature tracking that speeds up the recognition process by using the concept of adaptive sampling. We select two examples of visual algorithms to be modified by adaptive sampling and present comparative results with and without modifications. We show how processing time and memory footprint can benefit by this approach with little impact on overall output quality. We implement our proposed methods on a chipset commonly found on smartphones and we discuss the obtained improvements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2163450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6032143/05971771.pdf","startPage":"1467","endPage":"1475","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2163450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sampling for Feature Detection, Tracking, and Recognition on Mobile Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sampling for Feature Detection, Tracking, and Recognition on Mobile Platforms","volume":"21","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5971771/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270608","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sampling for Feature Detection, Tracking, and Recognition on Mobile Platforms","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-ebrahimi-2163450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048648S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6032143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6032143","articleId":"5971771","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5971777,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Min Shin","affiliation":["Department of Applied Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5993779/5971777/5971777-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Min Shin received the B.S. degree from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in physics from the Seoul National University, Seoul, in 2006.","From 2001 to 2003, he was a Visiting Researcher with the Klystron/Microwave Department, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Menlo Park, CA.

However, they often show less capability in dealing with nonstationary signals with time-varying frequency due to the bad energy concentration in the time-frequency plane. On the other hand, by introducing an extra transform kernel that matches the instantaneous frequency of the signal, parameterized TFA methods show powerful ability in characterizing time-frequency patterns of nonstationary signals with time-varying frequency. In this paper, a novel time-frequency transform, called spline-kernelled chirplet transform (SCT), is proposed. By introducing a frequency-rotate operator and a frequency-shift operator constructed with spline kernel function, the SCT is particularly powerful for the strongly nonlinear frequency-modulated signals. In addition, an effective algorithm is developed to estimate the parameters of transform kernel in the SCT. The capabilities of the SCT and parameter estimation algorithm are validated by their applications for numerical signals and a set of vibration signal collected from a rotor test rig.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2163376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2163376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058663","startPage":"1612","endPage":"1621","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6058663/05971783.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971783","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Splines (mathematics)","Chirp","Transforms","Approximation methods","Polynomials","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machines","Fourier transforms","frequency modulation","parameter estimation","rotors","signal processing","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spline-kernelled chirplet transform","signal analysis","time-varying frequency","time-frequency transform analysis","TFA methods","short-time Fourier transform","continuous wavelet transform","Wigner-Ville distribution","SCT","frequency-shift operator","frequency-rotate operator","nonlinear frequency-modulated signals","rotor test rig","vibration signal","energy concentration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chirplet transform (CT)","instantaneous frequency (IF)","spline-kernelled chirplet transform (SCT)","time\u2013frequency representation (TFR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spline-Kernelled Chirplet Transform for the Analysis of Signals With Time-Varying Frequency and Its Application","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12315635","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5971783/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971783/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spline-Kernelled Chirplet Transform for the Analysis of Signals With Time-Varying Frequency and Its Application","sourcePdf":"tie-peng-2163376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087287S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6058663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6058663","articleId":"5971783","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5971786,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin Walter Reid","affiliation":["Radio FrequencyWorks, Saint Albert, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6095456/5971786/5971786-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Edwin Walter Reid received the B.Sc. degree in engineering physics and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.","He is the President of Radio Frequency Works, which is a privately owned consulting engineering firm located at St. Albert, AB, Canada, that specializes in industrial/military applications of radio frequency (RF) energy.

These methods thus allow customizing the precision of a multilevel DWT to a given error tolerance requirement and ensuring an energy-minimal implementation, which increases the applicability of DWT-based algorithms such as JPEG 2000 to energy-constrained platforms and environments. Additionally, quantization of DWT coefficients to a specific target step size is performed as an inherent part of the DWT computation, thereby eliminating the need to have a separate downstream quantization step in applications such as JPEG 2000. Experimental measurements of design performance in terms of area, speed, and power for 90-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor implementation are presented. Results indicate that while BP designs exhibit inherent speed advantages, DS designs require significantly fewer hardware resources with increasing precision and DWT level. A four-level DWT with medium precision, for example, while the BP design is four times faster than the digital-serial design, occupies twice the area. In addition to the BP and DS designs, a novel flexible DWT processor is presented, which supports run-time configurable DWT parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6129825/05971788.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2163519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2163519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precision-Aware Self-Quantizing Hardware Architectures for the Discrete Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Quantization","Transform coding","Hardware","Dynamic range","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","fixed point arithmetic","image coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precision-aware self-quantizing hardware architectures","discrete wavelet transform","computational accuracy","error tolerance requirement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fixed point arithmetic","image coding","very large scale integration (VLSI)","wavelet transforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Precision-Aware Self-Quantizing Hardware Architectures for the Discrete Wavelet Transform","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5971788/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12472199","pubMedId":"21824849","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision-Aware Self-Quantizing Hardware Architectures for the Discrete Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tip-lee-2163519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087706S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6129825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6129825","articleId":"5971788","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5971792,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Lavaei","affiliation":["Department of Control and Dynamical Systems, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6133486/5971792/5971792-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Javad Lavaei (SM'10) received the B.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003 and the M.A.Sc. degree from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2007, both in electrical engineering.

In this paper, we propose a semidefinite programming (SDP) optimization, which is the dual of an equivalent form of the OPF problem. A global optimum solution to the OPF problem can be retrieved from a solution of this convex dual problem whenever the duality gap is zero. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided in this paper to guarantee the existence of no duality gap for the OPF problem. This condition is satisfied by the standard IEEE benchmark systems with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses as well as several randomly generated systems. Since this condition is hard to study, a sufficient zero-duality-gap condition is also derived. This sufficient condition holds for IEEE systems after small resistance (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n per unit) is added to every transformer that originally assumes zero resistance. We investigate this sufficient condition and justify that it holds widely in practice. The main underlying reason for the successful convexification of the OPF problem can be traced back to the modeling of transformers and transmission lines as well as the non-negativity of physical quantities such as resistance and inductance.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2160974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2160974","startPage":"92","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6133486/05971792.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero Duality Gap in Optimal Power Flow Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Zero Duality Gap in Optimal Power Flow Problem","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12486395","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5971792/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero Duality Gap in Optimal Power Flow Problem","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-lavaei-2160974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112396S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6133486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"719","xplore-issue":"6133486","articleId":"5971792","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5971793,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Caiming Qiu","affiliation":["Cognitive Radio Institute, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center of Manufacturing Research, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6084801/5971793/5971793-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Caiming Qiu (S'93-M'96-SM'01) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from New York University (former Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY).","He was Founder-CEO and President of Wiscom Technologies, Inc., manufacturing and marketing WCDMA chipsets.

The surface properties of modified PTFE samples are characterized by the static contact angle, surface resistivity, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that the discharge power, EET, and surface wettability increase with the Ar flowing rate, and a slight decrease of surface resistivity is revealed after plasma treatment. The surface roughness of PTFE is enhanced, and the oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups are incorporated by the impacts of APPJ radical species. Moreover, the hydrophilicity of PTFE can be improved by a surface presanding process, particularly after APPJ treatment. Finally, the surface modification mechanisms of APPJ on PTFE are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/6070430/05971800.pdf","startPage":"3095","endPage":"3102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2011.2160569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2011.2160569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6070430","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Surface Modification of Polytetrafluoroethylene Coupled With Argon Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma Jet Characteristics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface treatment","Argon","Surface discharges","Discharges","Surface roughness","Rough surfaces","Plasmas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["argon","Boltzmann equation","discharges (electric)","hydrophilicity","plasma diagnostics","plasma dielectric properties","plasma jets","plasma transport processes","polymers","scanning electron microscopy","surface roughness","wetting","X-ray photoelectron spectra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface modification","polytetrafluoroethylene","argon dielectric barrier discharge plasma jet","plasma diagnostics","dielectric surface analysis","discharge power","Lissajous figure","electron excitation temperature","optical emission spectrum","Boltzmann diagrammatic method","static contact angle","surface resistivity","scanning electron microscopy","X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","surface wettability","surface roughness","oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups","hydrophilicity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ)","polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)","presanding processes","surface modification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Research on Surface Modification of Polytetrafluoroethylene Coupled With Argon Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma Jet Characteristics","volume":"39","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5971800/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12331272","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Surface Modification of Polytetrafluoroethylene Coupled With Argon Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma Jet Characteristics","sourcePdf":"tps-shao-2160569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095992S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"6070430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6070430","articleId":"5971800","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5971909,"authors":[{"name":"Young Chul Lee","affiliation":["Mokpo National Maritime University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Chul Lee","id":"37087298753"},{"name":"Suhandi Bujang","affiliation":["System Technology, TM Research and Development Innovation Centre, Telecom Malaysia Research & Development, Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Suhandi","lastName":"Bujang","id":"37847328900"},{"name":"Mohd.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","doi":"10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","publicationTitle":"2011 Ninth Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Ninth Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel5/5961997/5971950/05971981.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5971950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data preprocessing for distance-based unsupervised Intrusion Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5971981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5971981/","displayDocTitle":"Data preprocessing for distance-based unsupervised Intrusion Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12171048","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5971981/","conferenceDate":"19-21 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data preprocessing for distance-based unsupervised Intrusion Detection","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"paper6534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095471S","chronDate":"19-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5961997","isNumber":"5971950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5961997","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5971950","articleId":"5971981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5972076,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhi","affiliation":["Province Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Hui Zhi","id":"37606321300"},{"name":"Hongbo Zhu","affiliation":["Province Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Hongbo Zhu","id":"37289613500"},{"name":"Longxiang Yang","affiliation":["Province Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Longxiang Yang","id":"37405193200"},{"name":"Meiling Ding","affiliation":["Province Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Meiling Ding","id":"37893908000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9763-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9762-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9761-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5972076","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":111},"abstract":"Broadcast transmission is used in the downlink of TD SCDMA trunking systems with the same frequency and same time slot macro-diversity model, and base stations transmit the same signal simultaneously.

The object detection system detects all the instances of objects (for which the classifier was trained) in the given image, regardless of their scales and locations. Therefore, the image can be thus seen as a set of sub-windows that are to be evaluated by the detector. The detector selects those sub-windows that contain the instances of the objects trained. The traditional approach for multiclass object detection is to use different independent classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and requires a lot of training data. To achieve a fast and robust implementation, shared features are used. In the existing schemes, part-based models have been used for evaluating the object features, so these features being more class-specific cannot share more information among different classes. Hence in this paper, rectangular features called Haar-like features which are more generic is used and thus more number of features can be shared. The proposed scheme uses Joint-Boosting algorithm for training the multiclass object classifier. The benefits of illumination normalisation or variance normalisation technique used to neutralise the effect of changing lighting conditions are explored. Though the proposed scheme is validated for car and pedestrian classes, the training and detection techniques used in this scheme can be generalised for any object class.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972251","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972251.pdf","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass object detection system in imaging sensor network using Haar-like features and Joint-Boosting algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972251/","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass object detection system in imaging sensor network using Haar-like features and Joint-Boosting algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145594","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972251/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass object detection system in imaging sensor network using Haar-like features and Joint-Boosting algorithm","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"1030MulticlassObjectDetectionSystem.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048999S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5972252,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This paper proposes a hybrid mechanism called \"SUBCLUST\" that combines clustering and subset formation. It is observed that randomization while dividing the subsets is not an efficient method to improve the lifetime of WSN. Hence in the proposed scheme during subset formation each sensor's coverage area is assumed to overlap with other sensor. The one with the least area of overlapping is added to the subset to which the current sensor belongs. This process continues until all the sensors are allotted to a particular subset. In order to minimize the energy consumption, scheduling is done in such a way that only one subset of nodes which covers the entire network will remain active at a time and making the remaining subset of nodes to get deactivated. Each subset will be activated one after another to ensure that no event is gone unnoticed. The proposed scheme also uses ARN (Active Routing Nodes) for packet forwarding which minimizes handoff while subset switching occurs. The proposed novel hybrid scheme has been validated using simulation studies and it is observed that the proposed scheme gives better performance than the existing work in terms of network lifetime, network coverage intensity, energy utilization and detection probability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","startPage":"613","endPage":"617","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972253.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundant node deactivation by scheduling in wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972253/","displayDocTitle":"Redundant node deactivation by scheduling in wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145596","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundant node deactivation by scheduling in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"1032RedundantNodeDeactivationbySchedulinginWi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056206S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5972259,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The most important aspect in cognitive radio is spectrum sensing where the secondary user is able to access the spectrum of the primary user in the absence of the latter. Hidden terminals act as a source of interference by producing false information whereas the use of conventional Space Time Block Codes (STBC) increases the control information overhead. The proposed technique which uses cooperative communication for spectrum sensing and RSTC for cooperation between the relay nodes promises to solve the above mentioned problems. Simulation results obtained using MATLAB illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme over the conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972259","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972259.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972259","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","startPage":"43","endPage":"47","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative energy detection scheme for cognitive radio using RSTC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative energy detection scheme for cognitive radio using RSTC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972259/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972259/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145601","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative energy detection scheme for cognitive radio using RSTC","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"131CooperativeEnergyDetectionSchemeforCogniti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045719S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5972260,"authors":[{"name":"Pilla Jagadeesh","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Pondicherry Engineering College, Pondicherry, India"],"firstName":"Pilla","lastName":"Jagadeesh","id":"37947760200"},{"name":"Jayanthi Pragatheeswaran","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Pondicherry Engineering College, Pondicherry, India"],"firstName":"Jayanthi","lastName":"Pragatheeswaran","id":"37947748000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0590-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0588-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0589-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5972260","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"abstract":"Image resolution enhancement is a usable process for many image processing applications such as geoscience studies, astronomy and geographical information systems. One of the traditional methods used to increase the image resolution is image interpolation but the potential problem associated with it is to magnify the image many times without loss in image clarity. However, all the classical linear interpolation techniques like bilinear, bi-cubic interpolation methods generate blurred image. By employing dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) on a edge directional interpolation, it is possible to recover the high frequency components which provides an image with good visual clarity and thus super resolved high resolution images are obtained. The obtained simulation results comply with the above stated claim.

The applications may have different deadline criteria. Based on the nature of the deadline, the applications are categorised as mission-critical, firm and soft. In this paper, a load balanced algorithm is proposed for non-pre-emptively scheduling a bag of independent tasks in a heterogeneous computing environment. The load of a machine is the sum of execution times of tasks that are currently scheduled in it. This scheduler has three major goals i)To maximize the number of mission-critical tasks meeting their deadline ii)To maximize the total number of tasks meeting their deadline iii) To achieve a load balance on all the machines by minimising the load difference. The algorithm is compared for various performance metrics, with the other algorithms in the literature and proves to be better.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972269","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972269.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load balanced scheduling of independent tasks in heterogeneous computing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972269/","displayDocTitle":"Load balanced scheduling of independent tasks in heterogeneous computing systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972269/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145611","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load balanced scheduling of independent tasks in heterogeneous computing systems","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"198LoadBalancedSchedulingofIndependentTasksin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055102S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5972283,"authors":[{"name":"I.

As a consequence, any complete security package includes a network Intrusion Detection System (nIDS). This work focuses on nIDSs which work by scanning the network traffic. We have combined classifiers based on packet header information with classifiers based on payload distribution to increase detection rates in non-flood attacks. We have divided packet processing into two parts as header information processing and payload processing. In header information processing we select features from packet header and create model for normal behavior with histograms, then find out the deviation from created models and classify the network traffic. In payload processing we create models of normal payload by generating histograms of payload ASCII distribution and find deviation from created models and classify traffic. Our work differs from previous anomaly based detection techniques by creating histograms for both network header features and for payload of packet, so that our detection system identifies both flooding attacks and non flooding attacks efficiently.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972283.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"416","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection system based on analysis of packet header and payload histograms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Payloads","Histograms","IP networks","Feature extraction","Intrusion detection","Computational modeling","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection system","packet header analysis","payload histograms","computer networks","network attacks","security package","network intrusion detection system","nIDS","network traffic","payload ASCII distribution","detection rates","nonflood attacks","header information processing","flooding attacks","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection System","Attacks","histograms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection system based on analysis of packet header and payload histograms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972283/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145625","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection system based on analysis of packet header and payload histograms","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"248AnomalydetectionsystembasedonAnalysisofpac.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081601S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5972289,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Apart from the spectral information, textural parameters and contextual information are usually used by human being in object recognition from images. Contributing texture information in the neural network input parameters seems to be an improving idea for road detection from satellite images. Different texture parameters show different aspects of textural behaviour in a defined neighbourhood of a given pixel. Artificial neural networks are found to be superior to several previous techniques due in part to their ability to incorporate both spectral and contextual information. In this paper, Neural Networks are applied on high resolution satellite images for road detection. At first, road detection has been performed using only spectral information. Then different texture parameters including contrast, energy, entropy and homogeneity are computed for each pixel using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) from source image and a pre-classified road raster map is produced. To optimize neural networks' functionality and to evaluate the impact of contributing texture parameters in road detection, extracted texture parameters are integrated with the spectral information.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972323","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972323.pdf","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1065","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated road network extraction using artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Automated road network extraction using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12159091","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972323/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated road network extraction using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"393AutomatedRoadNetworkExtractionUsingArtific.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076425S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5972330,"authors":[{"name":"Rachel Selva Dhanaraj","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Computer Science and Information Systems, ETC Department, Goa University, Goa, India"],"firstName":"Rachel Selva","lastName":"Dhanaraj","id":"37947764600"},{"name":"Lucy Gudino","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Computer Science and Information Systems, ETC Department, Goa University, Goa, India"],"firstName":"Lucy","lastName":"Gudino","id":"38190808900"},{"name":"Joseph Rodrigues","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Computer Science and Information Systems, ETC Department, Goa University, Goa, India"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37552371300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0590-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0588-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0589-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5972330","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Array signal processing","Antenna arrays","Finite impulse response filter","Finite element methods","Least squares approximation","Chebyshev approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","interference suppression","radiocommunication","radiofrequency interference","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming algorithm","wireless communication network","smart antenna array","space division multiplexing","wireless transmission quality","interference","local scattering","multipath propagation","digital signal processing","narrow beam pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Smart Antennas","Adaptive","Array factor","Mean Square"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972330","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972330","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","abstract":"It is required to provide enough capacity in the wireless communication system due to increased number of users as well as new high bit rate services being introduced. One of the most promising techniques for increasing the capacity is smart antenna based space division multiplexing. One approach to implement smart antennas is based on array beamforming, where a narrow main beam is directed towards the desired user direction, while the nulls or the sidelobes with very low levels are adjusted towards other users. Recently, smart antennas have been proposed as a promising solution that can significantly increase the data rate and improve the quality of wireless transmission, which is limited by interference, local scattering, and multipath propagation. The antenna array is combined with digital signal processing to give a narrow beam pattern in response to the received signal by the smart antenna. The weights of the beamformer is calculated by using the adaptive approach which uses reference signal and the direction of the user based on the received signal. The main beam is then directed toward the specific user, while the nulls are adjusted toward the interferers.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972330.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of adaptive beamforming algorithms for wireless communication networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972330/","displayDocTitle":"Development of adaptive beamforming algorithms for wireless communication networks","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12159098","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of adaptive beamforming algorithms for wireless communication networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"417DevelopmentofAdaptiveBeamformingAlgorithms.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03746S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5972341,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This paper presents a new approach for automated diagnosis based on classification of the magnetic resonance images (MRI). The proposed method consists of two stages namely feature extraction and classification. In the first stage, we have obtained the features related to MRI images using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). Wavelet transform based methods are a well known tool for extracting frequency space information from non-stationary signals. The features extracted using DWT of magnetic resonance images have been reduced, using principal component analysis (PCA), to the more essential features. In the classification stage, two classifiers have been developed. The first classifier is based on feed forward back propagation artificial neural network (FP-ANN) and the second classifier is based on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). The features hence derived are used to train a neural network based binary classifier, which can automatically infer whether the image is that of a normal brain or a pathological brain, suffering from brain lesion. A classification with a success of 90% and 99% has been obtained by FP-ANN and k-NN, respectively. This result shows that the proposed technique is robust and effective compared with other recent work.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972341","startPage":"563","endPage":"568","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972341.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of MRI brain images using k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972341/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of MRI brain images using k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972341/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12159109","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of MRI brain images using k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"453ClassificationofMRIBrainImagesusingkNeares.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078371S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5972345,"authors":[{"name":"Ayush Vrat","affiliation":["Department of MBA & MSCLIS, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Ayush","lastName":"Vrat","id":"37947779700"},{"name":"Manish Sachan","affiliation":["Department of MBA & MSCLIS, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Sachan","id":"37953291300"},{"name":"Aarti Gautam Dinker","affiliation":["Department of MBA & MSCLIS, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Aarti Gautam","lastName":"Dinker","id":"37947780000"},{"name":"Deepanshu Arora","affiliation":["Department of MBA & MSCLIS, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Deepanshu","lastName":"Arora","id":"37944349500"},{"name":"Anurika Vaish","affiliation":["Department of MBA & MSCLIS, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Anurika","lastName":"Vaish","id":"37680190000"},{"name":"S.

Mobility Services in Cloud enable nodes to move seamlessly between access networks while maintaining network connectivity and utilize uninterrupted services while on the move. A widespread usage of these services indicates the requirement of more IP addresses, but the IPv4 addresses are exhausting and a transition to IPv6 address is required. The concern is to find a secure, efficient, reliable, and cost effective method to enable mobility for Cloud Services in an environment with support to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. In this paper we propose a model to enhance the mobility services in Cloud by utilizing the concept of HMIPv6 in coexistent network and produce a performance analysis of the existing models with the proposed model. The proposed model reduces the burden on existing IPv4 addresses and enhances Mobility as a service in Cloud Computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972345.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"643","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of enhanced mobility model in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manganese","Mobile communication","Computational modeling","Cloud computing","IP networks","Analytical models","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer network performance evaluation","IP networks","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","enhanced mobility model","cloud computing","mobility services","network connectivity","uninterrupted service utilization","IPv4 addresses","IPv6 addresses","HMIPv6"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","IP Mobility","Hierarchical","Coexistent Network","Tunnel Broker","Macro and Micro Mobility","Cloud Service Provider (CSP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of enhanced mobility model in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12159113","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of enhanced mobility model in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"482PerformanceAnalysisofEnhancedMobilityModel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061708S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5972382,"authors":[{"name":"S Sujithaa","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and communication engineering, Chennai"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Sujithaa","id":"37085944655"},{"name":"Prita Nair","affiliation":["Department of Physics SSN College of Engineering, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Prita","lastName":"Nair","id":"37645215000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0590-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0588-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0589-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5972382","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Encoding","Photonic crystals","Silicon","Slabs","Passive optical networks","Optical pulses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","optical fibre networks","photonic crystals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PC based 2D OCDMA encoder","PON","optical code division multiple access encoder","ID photonic crystal structure","two dimensional wavelength time coding scheme","2D wavelength time coding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive optical network (PON)","optical code division multiple access (OCDMA)","photonic crystal (PC)","electro optic effect","transfer matrix method (TMM)"]}],"abstract":"We propose a design of an optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) encoder made of silicon based 2D and 1D photonic crystal (PC) structures.

A remedy to spectrum scarcity is to improve spectrum utilization by spectrum sensing where the secondary unlicensed users are allowed to access the underutilized licensed bands when the primary licensed users are inactive. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) is done by collaboratively detecting the spectrum holes by Energy Detection technique to improve the spectrum sensing performance. In most existing contributions each Cognitive Radio reports their local sensing results to a Cognitive Base Station (CBS) for a final decision where the reporting channel is considered as an ideal error free channel. In this paper a realistic cooperative spectrum sensing network is designed where the reporting channels from the cognitive radios (CRs) to the CBS are affected by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading. To minimize the effects caused by these channel uncertainties an optimal Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detector is used to improve the detection performance under realistic spectrum sensing environment. Simulation results investigating the performance degradation incurred by considering realistic reporting channels is analysed and presented in various practical scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972388/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12168921","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972388/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in a Realistic Cognitive Radio Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in a Realistic Cognitive Radio Environment","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"684CooperativeSpectrumSensinginaRealisticCogn.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054616S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5972392,"authors":[{"name":"Prashant Srivastava","affiliation":["MBA & MS-CLIS Division, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Prashant","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37971230800"},{"name":"Satyam Singh","affiliation":["MBA & MS-CLIS Division, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Satyam","lastName":"Singh","id":"37966485400"},{"name":"Ashwin Alfred Pinto","affiliation":["MBA & MS-CLIS Division, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Ashwin Alfred","lastName":"Pinto","id":"37957055800"},{"name":"Shvetank Verma","affiliation":["MBA & MS-CLIS Division, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Shvetank","lastName":"Verma","id":"37953030000"},{"name":"Vijay K.

This quest is stymied by the significant challenge of security, triggering a dilemma of whether or not to adopt this promising new technology. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the client has to rely on the claims of the security capabilities of the Cloud Service Provider, with little or no monitoring and validation.

Spectrum sensing is an important enabling technology for future opportunistic spectrum sharing scenarios. In this paper, a novel protocol is proposed to determine the maximum number of samples required to obtain the desired Probability of Detection (Pd) for a given SNR. In energy detection, the Probability of Detection has varied against the number of samples (N) for different values of SNR. It is observed that, for a particular SNR, the Probability of Detection increases continuously with the increasing number of samples. However after a certain value of the number of samples, the increase in the Probability of Detection becomes insignificant. In order to optimize the number of samples required to obtain the desired Probability of Detection (Pd), first, the adaptive threshold is to be fixed with CFAR theory then a set of curves are plotted between (Pd) Vs N with varying SNR values. From the plots the local maxima points thereafter the Pd improvement is insignificant are noted. These points are referred to as (Pd-sat) points with respect to various SNR values and are representing the maximum number of samples required to obtain the desired Probability of Detection (Pd), for a given SNR. This simulation work is carried out using MATLAB. The proposed protocol is verified using sin, OFDM and DVB-T signals as inputs. The results are tabulated and plotted. From the results it is observed that the proposed procedure is working satisfactorily. Niemen Pearson detector is used to calculate the probability of detection. This protocol seems to be simple and does not require solving complex mathematical models representing the dynamic spectrum sensing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","startPage":"53","endPage":"57","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972406.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel protocol for enhancing the speed of dynamic spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972406/","displayDocTitle":"Novel protocol for enhancing the speed of dynamic spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12145652","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel protocol for enhancing the speed of dynamic spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"770Novelprotocolforenhancingthespeedofdynamic.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063738S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5972418,"authors":[{"name":"Anurag Shivam Prasad","affiliation":["Department of ECE Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Anurag Shivam","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37849072400"},{"name":"Sandeep Vasudevan","affiliation":["Department of ECE Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Vasudevan","id":"37086912175"},{"name":"R Selvalakshmi","affiliation":["Department of ECE Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Selvalakshmi","id":"37085944513"},{"name":"K Sree Ram","affiliation":["Department of ECE Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"K Sree","lastName":"Ram","id":"37085948951"},{"name":"G Subhashini","affiliation":["Department of ECE Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"G","lastName":"Subhashini","id":"37085948028"},{"name":"S Sujitha","affiliation":["Department of ECE Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Sujitha","id":"37085944842"},{"name":"B Sabarish Narayanan","affiliation":["Department of ECE Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"B Sabarish","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"38254938500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0590-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0588-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0589-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5972418","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1380},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972418","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Adaptive arrays","Kalman filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","adaptive signal processing","array signal processing","computational complexity","conjugate gradient methods","least mean squares methods","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive algorithms","digital beamforming","smart antennas","phase shifting","array weighing","least mean square algorithm","recursive least square algorithm","conjugate gradient method","computational complexity","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["smart antennas","adaptive beamforming","long term evolution(LTE)","kalman filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972418","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972418.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of adaptive algorithms for digital beamforming in Smart Antennas","abstract":"Smart Antennas have been gaining popularity in the recent times, as a means to enhance data rate. The reason behind this development is the availability of high-end processors to handle the complex computations involved. The major advantage of digital beamformer (smart antennas) is that phase shifting and array weighing can be performed on digital data rather than in hardware. This paper analyses the performance of three adaptive algorithms - Least Mean Square (LMS), Recursive Least Square (RLS) and Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM) for computing the array weights. In this paper digital beamforming is also performed using kalman based normalised Least Mean Square algorithm. This adaptive algorithm promises very high rate of convergence, highly reduced mean square error and low computational complexity compared to the existing adaptive algorithms. The weights obtained by the above algorithm are then used to steer the antenna array beam in the direction of interest, thereby enhancing SNR. One of the major requirements for Long Term Evolution (LTE), high datarate, can hence be achieved by smart antennas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972418/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12145654","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972418/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of adaptive algorithms for digital beamforming in Smart Antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of adaptive algorithms for digital beamforming in Smart Antennas","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"810AnalysisofAdaptiveAlgorithmsforDigitalBeam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12937S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5972420,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The three dimensional integration of NoC is achieved by stacking 2D layers. The communication between the layers is achieved by the presence of vertical links between the 3D nodes. We propose a deterministic routing scheme for choosing the 3D node and it uses the xy routing within the 2D layers. Our algorithm finds path from any source to specified destination. The unique feature of this model is the search for the proximal vertical 3D node towards the destination router. It is inferred from the result that the routing scheme can achieve better performance in terms of reduced latency compared with the 3D routing method. The algorithm is implemented in FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972420","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","startPage":"385","endPage":"388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of low latency routing algorithm for 3D Network on Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of low latency routing algorithm for 3D Network on Chip","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972420/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12168947","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972420/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of low latency routing algorithm for 3D Network on Chip","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"816FPGAImplementationofLowLatencyRoutingAlgor.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056103S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5972424,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The feature extraction method used in Local Binary Pattern (LBP) fails in detecting the eye position and it is less sensitive to noise in uniform image regions. This paper proposes an Advanced Ternary Pattern (ATP) feature set to overcome these issues. The issue on noise sensitivity in uniform image regions such as cheeks and forehead is attempted to resolve using the normalization technique which regularizes all the extracted features under various lighting conditions. ATP feature set uses the Efficient Feature Orientation (EFO) method for effective and accurate face normalization. The proposed model improves the Face Verification Rate (FVR) up to 90% for the less dark images and about 78% for fully dark images. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme makes FRS insensitive to illumination.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972441","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972441.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","startPage":"975","endPage":"980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced feature set for face recognition under assorted lighting conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced feature set for face recognition under assorted lighting conditions","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972441/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12168966","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972441/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced feature set for face recognition under assorted lighting conditions","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"867AdvancedFeatureSetforFaceRecognitionunderA.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054767S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5972443,"authors":[{"name":"B H Shekar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Mangalore University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"B H","lastName":"Shekar","id":"37543692700"},{"name":"N Harivinod","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Mangalore University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"N","lastName":"Harivinod","id":"38256835900"},{"name":"M Sharmila Kumari","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, P.A.

The proposed model consists of a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from range images of faces that can be used to perform reliable matching between different poses of range images of faces. For a given 3D face scan, range images are computed and the potential interest points are identified by searching at all scales. Based on the stability of the interest point, significant points are extracted. For each significant point we compute the SULD descriptor which consists of vector made of values from the convolved Haar wavelet responses located on concentric circles centred on the significant point, and where the amount of Gaussian smoothing is proportional to the radii of the circles. Experimental results show that the newly proposed method provides higher recognition rate compared to other existing contemporary models developed for 3D face recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972443","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5945015/5972241/05972443.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972241","startPage":"981","endPage":"986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face recognition using significant point based SULD descriptor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D Face recognition using significant point based SULD descriptor","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972443/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12168967","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972443/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face recognition using significant point based SULD descriptor","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"8703DFaceRecognitionusingSignificantPointbase.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084688S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5972455,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Pipeline is a technique used to achieve parallelism at instruction level by dividing task into different stages and for every stage, it's output is the input for next the stage. Thus, pipeline limits the communication overhead by restricting it to only for previous and next stage. Pipeline also performs faster by overlapping the instructions. In this paper, we propose new approach for parallel implementation of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) using logical pipeline, which focuses on overlapping the execution of functions. Logical pipeline for MOPSO is the disposition of three stages, each for calculating velocity, evaluation and updating of archive. We compared the results with the different parallel models for MOPSO and improvement in time is significant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972468/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12168989","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972468/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pipeline for parallel implementation of multi-objective particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipeline for parallel implementation of multi-objective particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"934PipelineforParallelImplementationofMultiOb.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07058S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5945015","isNumber":"5972241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5945015","xplore-issue":"5972241","articleId":"5972468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5972469,"authors":[{"name":"Jambhlekar Pushkar Arun","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Department, Inidian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Jambhlekar Pushkar","lastName":"Arun","id":"37947884500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0590-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0588-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0589-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5972469","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Particle swarm optimization","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radius based guide selection technique","multiobjective particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","global best","guide selection","multi-objective","radius"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972469","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization has been shown to solve many real world optimization problems.

The acoustic signal produced by a motorbike engine is important information of fault diagnosis in any automobile. Previous approaches have been tried out in silent conditions.

The estimation of channel at pilot frequencies is based on LS and MMSE channel estimation algorithm.

The need of the hour is to provide a unified system that provides a seamless user experience on the move. Systems beyond IMT-2000 claim to have the capability to support services/applications that demand very stringent performance requirements. Standardization bodies are trying to achieve this by adopting cutting edge technologies and strategies that have evolved over the last few decades. WiMAX (802.16m) and LTE-Advanced (UMTS Release-10) are the mostly likely candidates to meet ITU defined IMT-Advanced performance goals. Both WiMAX and LTE have lot of technical similarities primarily on the radio access network side. Both have adopted an OFDMA based physical layer. Channel based scheduling algorithms; link adaptation techniques and hybrid ARQ are the common trait in these systems. Adaptive modulation and coding scheme (AMC) is another popular feature in this system which aims to exploit the channel conditions and assignment, to improve channel capacity. The performance of these systems is further augmented by embracing multiple antenna techniques. Flat network architecture and All-IP network are the buzzwords across standards to achieve throughput expansion and to reduce the capital and operational expenditure. The cutting edge technologies/strategies listed above are critical to achieve the performance target set through IMT-Advanced.

The proposed transmitter was developed based on a 3-level encoding process for quantizing the non-constant envelope signal. Therefore, the power amplifier is always operated under only a two-state output power level (maximum and 6dB back-off levels), achieving high efficiency. To maintain this high efficiency at a 6dB back-off output level, a lower DC supply voltage is supplied from a dual supply network (DSN) assisted on a digital process block. Using the proposed efficiency enhancement method, we have designed and implemented a 2.6GHz high-efficiency Class-J power amplifier (PA) using a commercial 10W PEP GaN device and a simple dual supply network. The experimental results show that, if the 0.51dB power loss of the band pass filter is de-embedded, the proposed power amplifier delivers a drain efficiency (DE) of 59.8% and power added efficiency (PAE) of 55.6%, with a gain of 11.1dB at an average output power of 34.5 dBm, for a 10 MHz 3G LTE signal with a 8.5 dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972614","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972614.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"60% high-efficiency 3G LTE power amplifier with three-level delta sigma modulation assisted by dual supply injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"60% high-efficiency 3G LTE power amplifier with three-level delta sigma modulation assisted by dual supply injection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972614/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180754","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60% high-efficiency 3G LTE power amplifier with three-level delta sigma modulation assisted by dual supply injection","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1115KKURunRbApZk2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080675S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5972615,"authors":[{"name":"Amin K.

Peak drain efficiencies of 75, 62, and 55% were obtained for these inputs, together with ACPR of -60dBc for EDSM EDGE signals and -43dBc for BPDSM CDMA signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972623/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180763","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient voltage-mode class-D power amplifier for digital transmitters with delta-sigma modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient voltage-mode class-D power amplifier for digital transmitters with delta-sigma modulation","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1130KL1Da8EeYpVt2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07137S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5972633,"authors":[{"name":"Margarita Puentes","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering and Photonics, Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Margarita","lastName":"Puentes","id":"37542201100"},{"name":"Christian Wei\u00df","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering and Photonics, Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wei\u00df","id":"37953731200"},{"name":"Martin Sch\u00fc\u00dfler","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering and Photonics, Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Sch\u00fc\u00dfler","id":"37300081900"},{"name":"Rolf Jakoby","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering and Photonics, Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Jakoby","id":"37274282700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972633","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":681},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Dielectrics","Resonant frequency","Lungs","Integrated circuit modeling","Capacitance","Permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biological tissues","biomedical equipment","cellular biophysics","lung","microstrip lines","microstrip resonators","permittivity","physiological models","sensor arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor array","microstrip-line-excited split ring resonators","organic tissue","dielectric properties","resonant frequency","MUT","prototype sensors","dielectric bricks","pig lung tissue"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Metamaterials","Organic Tissue","Permittivity Detection","Position Detection","Split Ring Resonators"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972633","abstract":"A sensor array concept has been developed using microstrip-line-excited split ring resonators (SRR).

The quarter-wavelength transformer is the bandwidth (BW) limit of the Doherty PA. Other bandwidth limiting factors are analyzed and eliminated. A conventional phase compensation circuit and an additional offset line are merged into the input network of the Doherty PA and the output circuit of the peaking amplifier, respectively. The multi-section output matching having the same impedance transformation and a broadband input matching are utilized. A Wilkinson power divider is transformed into a lumped type and integrated on a chip for enhancing the bandwidth of Doherty operation. For a LTE signal with a 7.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and a 10-MHz BW, the PA with a supply voltage of 4.5 V delivers a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 36.3%, and an adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of -32 dBc with an average output power of 27.5 dBm at a frequency of 1.85 GHz. Across 1.6-2.1 GHz, the PA performs a PAE of over 30%, a gain of over 28 dB and an ACLR of below -31 dBc at an average output power of 27.5 dBm while satisfying the standard spectrum mask.

This approach utilizes passive couplers to separate out different orthogonal eigenmodes of linear arrays with closely-spaced elements as individual radiation mechanisms. In this way, undesired effects due to mutual coupling and spatial correlations can be avoided. Consequently, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radio front-ends can be made very compact in size by simply using antenna arrays of closely-spaced (<; 0.5\u03bb) elements. An experimental three-element array module of 0.16\u03bb inter-element spacing is fabricated and tested. Good isolation (>; 16 dB) between any two of the three signal transmission/reception ports is obtained, and thus, validating this mode-based technique for realizing compact MIMO terminals.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972661","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972661.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mode-based technique for compact linear MIMO arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972661/","displayDocTitle":"A mode-based technique for compact linear MIMO arrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180795","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972661/","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mode-based technique for compact linear MIMO arrays","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1194KL2EyCOmNnPn2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043091S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5972665,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza.

multimode/multiband envelope tracking (ET) transmitter consisting of a hybrid switching amplifier (HSA) and a broadband saturated power amplifier (PA) is developed across 1.3 to 2.7 GHz.

The broadband saturated PA, taking advantage of a nonlinear output capacitor to shape the voltage waveform, is implemented based on load/source-pull methodology. Broadband matching networks for the high efficiency are synthesized by simplified real frequency technique. For the bandwidth from 1.3 to 2.7 GHz (70% fractional bandwidth), the measured output power, drain efficiency, and power-added efficiency (PAE) performances are between 39.8-42.0 dBm, 55.8-69.7%, and 51.2-65.3%, respectively.

For classical power amplifier (PA) the efficiency drops dramatically in the back-off region.

The idea of using an adaptive impedance matching network at the output of the transistor is presented and analyzed in this paper. The topology of the matching network enables the connection of the matching circuit directly to the transistor.

In portable scenarios, the antenna impedance is usually subject to wide variations, mostly due to its interaction with objects in the near field. This paper presents a miniature reconfigurable matching network that utilizes a novel circuit topology that minimizes insertion loss due to switch resistance and provides a wide range of impedance match over a bandwidth that exceeds one octave. The network can be implemented in a very small area, which makes it attractive for portable radios. Experimental results are provided for a unit designed for the military UHF satellite communication band that occupies the 220 to 450 MHz spectrum.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972685","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972685.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband reconfigurable matching network of reduced dimensions for the UHF military satellite communication band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972685/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband reconfigurable matching network of reduced dimensions for the UHF military satellite communication band","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240482","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972685/","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband reconfigurable matching network of reduced dimensions for the UHF military satellite communication band","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1237KL2JMmNeSmBm2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034438S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5972692,"authors":[{"name":"A. \u00c7a\u011fri Ulusoy","affiliation":["Institute of Electron Devices and Circuits, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"A.","lastName":"\u00c7a\u011fri Ulusoy","id":"37967999000"},{"name":"Hermann Schumacher","affiliation":["Institute of Electron Devices and Circuits, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Schumacher","id":"37266739100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972692","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972692","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Binary phase shift keying","Frequency modulation","Receivers","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","demodulators","Ge-Si alloys","heterojunction bipolar transistors","microstrip filters","millimetre wave filters","MMIC","quadrature phase shift keying","radiocommunication","system-on-package"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-package analog synchronous QPSK demodulator","ultra-high rate wireless communications","carrier phase","carrier frequency","feedforward carrier recovery","HBT MMIC","standard low cost substrate material","narrow-bandwidth microstrip bandpass filter","phase noise suppression","frequency 60 GHz","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["band pass filters","integrated circuit packaging","MMICs","wireless communication","ultra wideband communication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972692","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972692.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A system-on-package analog synchronous QPSK demodulator for ultra-high rate 60 GHz wireless communications","abstract":"A highly efficient QPSK demodulator module is presented, which synchronizes carrier phase and frequency in the analog domain by feed-forward carrier recovery.

Simulations show that resistors terminating the outer transmission line suppress the half-wavelength resonance and greatly extend the bandwidth. Using linear measurements at microwave frequencies, ferrite beads have been shown to behave as resistors with a small reactance, suitable for terminating the outer transmission line. This paper shows that ferrite beads can perform the dual role of improving magnetic coupling at low frequency and suppressing resonance at higher frequencies. The design methodology was applied to produce a balun that operates between 30MHz and 6GHz, displays less than 1dB of power loss up to 4.4GHz, and delivers an impedance transformation of 2:1.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972702/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240499","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A design methodology for the realization of multi-decade baluns at microwave frequencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design methodology for the realization of multi-decade baluns at microwave frequencies","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1261KL2LgCErXyZt2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047041S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5972703,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Liang Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Liang","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37627751900"},{"name":"Hong-Yeh Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hong-Yeh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280775200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972703","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":671},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Linearity","Transistors","Transconductance","Logic gates","Radio frequency","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","MMIC amplifiers","MMIC mixers","operational amplifiers","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS device linearity enhancement","modified third-order transconductance cancellation technique","microwave amplifier","third-order intermodulation distortion","Ka-band CMOS amplifiers","adjacent channel power ratio","64-QAM modulation signal","DC power consumption","mixer designs","size 0.13 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifier","CMOS","linearization","third-order transconductance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972703","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972703.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearity enhancement of CMOS device using a modified third-order transconductance cancellation technique for microwave amplifier","abstract":"This paper presents linearity enhancement of CMOS device for microwave amplifier applications.

The model consists of an accurate HBT model, models for internal pre-match circuits and models for coupled bond-wire arrays. The HBT model is scaled up from an AHBT (Agilent HBT) model for a unit cell transistor. The models for the internal pre-match circuits are lumped-element equivalent circuit models derived from the EM simulated S-parameters. For high power amplifiers, the coupling between the bond-wires must be accounted for. In this work, the coupling between the bond-wires is determined up to the 4th next bond-wires. The model of 120 W PA can precisely simulate small signal S-parameters as well as large signal performances of harmonic load-pull power sweep, such as output power, P1dB, G1dB, efficiency and operation current. A very good agreement between simulation and measurement has been achieved. The model is then applied to simulate a 250 W symmetric Doherty amplifier with an efficiency above 70%. The results of simulation agrees well with the measurement.

The carrier amplifier operates in class-B with a drain efficiency of 63% while the peaking amplifier operates in class-C with an efficiency of 73%. Independent drive control allows access to one or both amplifiers at a time controlling their performance individually with amplitude and phase predistortion. This both enhances system linearity and ensures that the peaking amplifier does not consume power during the generation of lower-level signals, further enhancing overall efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972732","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972732.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VHF Doherty amplifier with GaN FETs and independent drive-signal control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"VHF Doherty amplifier with GaN FETs and independent drive-signal control","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972732/","accessionNumber":"12240528","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972732/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VHF Doherty amplifier with GaN FETs and independent drive-signal control","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1323KL2X1rZjNxZl2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036531S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5972745,"authors":[{"name":"S.

direct-conversion transmitter (DCT) that uses non-constant envelope modulation schemes. The relevant theory provides a time-domain LO model with a modulated outer self-injection to predict the phase fluctuation of an LO that is pulled by the transmitter's modulated output signal. Based on a theoretical analysis, the proposed model can be used to evaluate the degraded quality of the transmission signal in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM) and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR). To mitigate the effects of LO pulling, a novel approach for reducing the AM-FM and PM-FM distortions by a combination of second-point VCO modulation and inner self-injection is proposed. The improved performance is verified by implementing a Quadrature-Phase-Shift-Keying (QPSK) transmitter for cdma 2000 1\u00d7 applications. The theoretical and experimental results agree closely with each other.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

For the designed and fabricated prototype device, over 20 dB suppression of common-mode noise is achieved over a frequency range from 1.18 GHz to 1.74 GHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972766.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Split rings-based differential transmission lines with common-mode suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Couplings","Bandwidth","Insertion loss","Capacitance","Electric fields","Filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","interference suppression","microstrip lines","microstrip resonators","telecommunication transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip differential transmission line","common mode noise suppression","complementary split ring resonators","differential signals","electric field components axial","CSRR","common mode excitation","frequency 1.18 GHz to 1.74 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential transmission lines","metamaterials","complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Split rings-based differential transmission lines with common-mode suppression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972766/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240562","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Split rings-based differential transmission lines with common-mode suppression","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1385KL3FUmUnVbQl2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0557S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5972768,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37965066100"},{"name":"Georg Fischer","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37288289900"},{"name":"Leon van den Oever","affiliation":["Radio Semiconductor Corporation B.V., Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Leon","lastName":"van den Oever","id":"37296060300"},{"name":"Christian Korden","affiliation":["TDK-EPC Corporation, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Korden","id":"37829887500"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37266288900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972768","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"abstract":"A new linear tapered diplexing power distributed amplifier (DA) based on composite right left handed transmission line (CRLH-TL) has been proposed and implemented.

The conversion from an analog to a digital signal, which can be handled by the subsequent switch-mode-stage, is implemented using a fast pulse-width-modulator. The complete class-S amplifier is characterized using clipped WCDMA signals with 5MHz and 80MHz bandwidth, respectively. For the 5MHz signal, the measured spectrum at the amplifier's output shows good EVM of <; 12% (approx. 1.5% degradation assumed for class-S PA) and also meets the 3GPP ACLR requirements within 9dB input power range. The capability to support large signal bandwidths is demonstrated, using an 80MHz WCDMA signal, thus meeting the expectations on class-S amplifier for the first time with respect to signal bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972780","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972780.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"900 MHz pulse-width-modulated class-s power amplifier with improved linearity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"900 MHz pulse-width-modulated class-s power amplifier with improved linearity","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972780/","accessionNumber":"12240575","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972780/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"900 MHz pulse-width-modulated class-s power amplifier with improved linearity","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1415KL3JFgIuTqGf2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.161484S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5972804,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Front end nonlinearities create spectral expansion which leads to radio interference in adjacent bands. The problem is greatly exacerbated for full duplex receivers with closely spaced Tx/Rx channels. This work proposes a novel radio architecture that can take care of out of band (OOB) emissions and allow interference free full duplex radio operation using appropriate nonlinear interference cancellation schemes. We propose that nonlinear operation and the resulting spectral re-growth can be handled without incurring any extra analog hardware in the RF front-end. This is accomplished at the cost of extra base band DSP workload. We then demonstrate that such an operation is indeed possible by setting up an experiment with a commercial RF front end chipset. This can possibly lead to a wide range of applications where interference cancellation can either facilitate or enable radio co-existence in upcoming multi-radio transceivers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972804","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972804.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compensation scheme to allow full duplex operation in the presence of highly nonlinear microwave components for 4 G systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A compensation scheme to allow full duplex operation in the presence of highly nonlinear microwave components for 4 G systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972804/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240599","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972804/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compensation scheme to allow full duplex operation in the presence of highly nonlinear microwave components for 4 G systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1456KL3L4cJdTpNk2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03464S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5972808,"authors":[{"name":"G.

(PAPR) reduction and digital pre-distortion (DPD) on radio frequency power amplifiers when an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is used. The PAPR reduction method, presented as a convex problem, is based on reshaping the time domain signal by redistributing its energy in the frequency domain, with respect to constraints on in-band and out-of-band errors. The DPD method consists of modeling the behavior of the power amplifier using a parallel Hammerstein model, and then extracting its inverse parameters based on the indirect learning approach. The cases where PAPR and DPD are applied separately and combined, are studied and investigated. Power amplifier figures of merit are evaluated. A good performance is shown when combining both pre-processing techniques up to a certain operating point where DPD performance deteriorates. Solutions to improve the DPD performance at strong compression are suggested.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972830","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-to-average power ratio reduction versus digital pre-distortion in OFDM based systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peak-to-average power ratio reduction versus digital pre-distortion in OFDM based systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972830/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240625","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972830/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-to-average power ratio reduction versus digital pre-distortion in OFDM based systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1497KL3MLPZzPmTp2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046204S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5972832,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Han","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, Center of Radiofrequency Electronics Research of Quebec (CREER), Ecole Polytechnique, University of Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Han","id":"37346542800"},{"name":"Ke Wu","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, Center of Radiofrequency Electronics Research of Quebec (CREER), Ecole Polytechnique, University of Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278659100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972832","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":586},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Receivers","Modulation","Radio frequency","Band pass filters","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","quadrature phase shift keying","radar detection","radio transceivers","road vehicle radar","substrate integrated waveguides","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar system","radio system","time-agile wireless sensing","time-agile wireless communication","radar sensing","radio communication","vehicular application","sequential time slots","single transceiver platform","substrate integrated waveguide","SIW technology","high-precision range detection","binary phase shift keying","BPSK","quadrature phase shift keying","QPSK","onboard multifunctional system","frequency 24 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication","multifunctional system","radar","substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","time-agile"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972832","abstract":"A multifunctional and time-agile system combining both radar sensing and radio communication capabilities is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for 24-GHz vehicular applications. By arranging the radar sensing mode and the radio communication mode in sequential time slots, the present system can operate with the flexibility and capability of functional reconfiguration and fusion using a single transceiver platform. To further reduce cost and also increase efficiency, a 24-GHz system demonstrator has been designed based on the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology. Preliminary experiments have verified system performance. In addition to high-precision range detection, the proposed system has proved a great capability of communication at a data rate of 50 Mbps for both binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK) and quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK). Therefore, this system is a very promising cost-effective solution for the development of 24-GHz onboard multifunctional systems.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972832","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972832.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"24-GHz joint radar and radio system capable of time-agile wireless sensing and communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"24-GHz joint radar and radio system capable of time-agile wireless sensing and communication","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972832/","accessionNumber":"12240627","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972832/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"24-GHz joint radar and radio system capable of time-agile wireless sensing and communication","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1499KL3MuuDsQxFq2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045642S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5972835,"authors":[{"name":"Walaa Sahyoun","affiliation":["IMEP-LAHC laboratory, UMR 5130, MINA TEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Walaa","lastName":"Sahyoun","id":"37400013700"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Duchamp","affiliation":["IMEP-LAHC laboratory, UMR 5130, MINA TEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Duchamp","id":"37266201500"},{"name":"Philippe Benech","affiliation":["IMEP-LAHC laboratory, UMR 5130, MINA TEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Benech","id":"37293779400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972835","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","Microwave filters","Resonator filters","Information filters","Phase shift keying","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Butterworth filters","microwave devices","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system test","microwave device","QPSK modulation","vector network analyzer","EVM system parameter","transmission S-parameter","VNA test","RF-device characteristics","Butterworth filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ADS Ptolemy simulator","EVM","QPSK","RF characterization","time of test","VNA measurements"]}],"abstract":"Vector Network Analyzer is considered as the classical characterization instrument for RF-devices but it requires time, equipments and increases the cost of tested equipments.

A key technology breakthrough enabling this simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) capability is the recent development of a transmit-isolating photonic receive (TIPRx) link that functions both as the first-stage LNA in the receive front end and as an RF circulator, enabling a bidirectional interface to an antenna while isolating the receive chain from the transmit signal by 40 dB or more over bandwidths spanning multiple decades. While broadband LNAs have been commercially available for many years, to the authors' knowledge the TIPRx is the only technology that can presently offer such high T/R isolation over such wide bandwidths while simultaneously ensuring low noise figure for the receive chain. This paper describes the TIPRx and some additional issues involved in implementing a single-aperture STAR system.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972840","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972840.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonics for simultaneous transmit and receive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Photonics for simultaneous transmit and receive","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972840/","accessionNumber":"12240635","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972840/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonics for simultaneous transmit and receive","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1515KL1OneBgBsEi2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03604S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5972851,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Instead of matching the output of the GaN transistor to 50 \u03a9 and connecting it to a 50-\u03a9 bandpass filter, the GaN is directly integrated with a one-pole filter thus eliminating the conventionally-employed output matching network after the GaN transistor. This leads to a reduced circuit complexity and higher efficiency. The one-pole filter implemented by a strongly-coupled evanescent-mode cavity resonator with an unloaded quality factor of 320 is experimentally presented as a proof-of-concept demonstration. This design yields a very narrowband PA response from 1.24-1.275 GHz (2.8%), which is comparable to the bandwidth of typical communication signals. The PA exhibits a state-of-the-art performance of >; 70% efficiency, >; 10 dB gain, >; 30 dBm output power, and second and third harmonic levels of <; -70 dBc. The presented methodology has the potential to be further extended to a tunable design for multi-band applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cavity resonators","Impedance matching","Power harmonic filters","Transistors","Gallium nitride","Resonant frequency","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","cavity resonators","circuit complexity","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","Q-factor","transistors","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier","narrowband filter","high-Q evanescent-mode cavity resonator","matching network","integrated evanescent-mode resonator","transistor","bandpass filter","one-pole filter","circuit complexity","strongly-coupled evanescent-mode cavity resonator","quality factor","narrowband PA response","multiband applications","frequency 1.24 GHz to 1.275 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","evanescent-mode cavity","narrowband filter","high efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972854","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972854.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-design of power amplifier and narrowband filter using high-Q evanescent-mode cavity resonator as the output matching network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Co-design of power amplifier and narrowband filter using high-Q evanescent-mode cavity resonator as the output matching network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972854/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972854/","accessionNumber":"12240649","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-design of power amplifier and narrowband filter using high-Q evanescent-mode cavity resonator as the output matching network","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1542KL3QKhIbUvYp2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044931S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5972855,"authors":[{"name":"Sherif Sayed Ahmed","affiliation":["Rohde and Schwarz GmbH and Company KG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Sherif Sayed","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37593187100"},{"name":"Andreas Schiessl","affiliation":["Rohde and Schwarz GmbH and Company KG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Schiessl","id":"37601718700"},{"name":"Lorenz-Peter Schmidt","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering and High Frequency Technology (LHFT), University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Lorenz-Peter","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37266287000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972855","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1022},"abstract":"The interest on active millimeter-wave and microwave imaging systems is increasing nowadays due to their utilization in security, medical, and industrial applications. Imaging systems using monostatic arrays suffer from the high number of antenna positions, making a fully electronic solution very costly and impractical. Multistatic arrays, however, offer the chance for high reduction factors in the number of antennas, and then allow for fully electronic solutions. Here, a new array architecture is presented, which is suitable for real-time operation and is capable of delivering high image quality in means of resolution and dynamic range. An example array is demonstrated for operation from 72 to 80 GHz.

The phase shift mechanism is based on the synthesis of a low dielectric slab in the middle of the SIW using an array of air holes. A simple design technique is proposed where unit cells are simply cascaded, which leads to the summation of their phase shift. The number of holes, their diameter and their spacing can be adjusted in order to obtain the required phase shift, thus giving a very flexible structure. Two different phase shifters, both giving a phase shift of 30\u00b0 are designed and simulated. Finally, an experimental validation in the Ka band (26.5 to 40 GHz) is presented for both circuits.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972871","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972871.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband phase shifter using air holes in Substrate Integrated Waveguide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972871/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband phase shifter using air holes in Substrate Integrated Waveguide","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240666","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972871/","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband phase shifter using air holes in Substrate Integrated Waveguide","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1573KL3ROvDbBnCs2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058851S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5972873,"authors":[{"name":"Neal Tuffy","affiliation":["RF and Microwave Research Group, University College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Neal","lastName":"Tuffy","id":"37947650500"},{"name":"Anding Zhu","affiliation":["RF and Microwave Research Group, University College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Anding","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37277394200"},{"name":"Thomas J.

Specific considerations have been given to harmonic suppression concerns which are addressed by appropriate choice of matching network topology. The method is justified by amplifier fabrication using a commercially available 10W GaN HEMT transistor and achieving an efficiency of at least 60% over a 15% bandwidth from 2.3-2.7GHz. Output power between 10-12W was delivered across the band, centered at 2.5GHz. Harmonic suppression of at least -41dBc and -39dBc was obtained across the second and third harmonic bands respectively, largely removing the dependency on post-filtering.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972873.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class-J RF power amplifier with wideband harmonic suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power harmonic filters","Bandwidth","Power amplifiers","Impedance","Harmonics suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","harmonics suppression","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Class-J RF power amplifier","wideband harmonic suppression","narrowband passive harmonic load-pull","network topology","amplifier fabrication","HEMT transistor","power 10 W to 12 W","bandwidth 2.3 GHz to 2.7 GHz","frequency 2.5 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-J","harmonic suppression","high efficiency","power amplifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Class-J RF power amplifier with wideband harmonic suppression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972873/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240668","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class-J RF power amplifier with wideband harmonic suppression","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1575KL3MDUClCqSv2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049475S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5972874,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This architecture is based on controlling the output power of highly efficient power amplifiers. Compared with the classical LINC, an multilevel selection algorithm is developed to optimise the levels depedent on the signal statistics in order to boost average power efficiency. Based on this algorithm, a multilevel LINC transmitter is implemented on a system-level. The architecture can be configured for different standards, such as EDGE, WCDMA and LTE. Models and algorithm are developed in SystemC and Matlab for the exploration of design specification and verification of the complete system. Simulation results show that compared with the classical LINC, average power added efficiency is improved from 10.5 % to 29.26 % for an uplink LTE signal with a peak-to-average power ratio of 6 dB. Futhermore, compared with equal-distance multilevel LINC systems, an efficiency boosting between 6 % and 0.5 % points can also be achieved for 2 to 8 multilevels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972887","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972887.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level performance study of a multistandard outphasing transmitter using optimised multilevels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"System-level performance study of a multistandard outphasing transmitter using optimised multilevels","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5972887/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240682","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972887/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-level performance study of a multistandard outphasing transmitter using optimised multilevels","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1608KL3Sa8ByBtOe2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042066S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5972891,"authors":[{"name":"Danish Kalim","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Danish","lastName":"Kalim","id":"37399321800"},{"name":"Renato Negra","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Negra","id":"37275858200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972891","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Impedance","Harmonic analysis","Power generation","Frequency measurement","Transmission lines","Microwave FETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent planar multiharmonic dual-band load coupling network","switching-mode power amplifiers","compact planar multiharmonic load transformation network","transmission lines","high impedance stubs","harmonic frequency termination","high electron mobility transistor","HEMT","GSM1810 operation","LTE2655 operation","passive switchless MHLTN","class-E load coupling network","dual-band input matching network","power added efficiency","efficiency 78.4 percent","efficiency 61.3 percent","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E","GaN HEMT","dual-band","optimum impedances","output power","power added efficiency (PAE)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972891","abstract":"This paper presents a concept to design a compact planar multiharmonic load transformation network (MHLTN) for the realisation of highly efficient dual-band power amplifiers (PAs).

A spatial filter, coupled to the FDTD update equations, stabilizes those subgrids that are simulated at time steps above their stability limit. The proposed method is used to implement very high aspect ratio subgrids, maintaining late-time stability over millions of time steps.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972916.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spatial filter-enabled high-resolution subgridding scheme for stable FDTD modeling of multiscale geometries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial filter-enabled high-resolution subgridding scheme","multiscale geometry stable FDTD modelling","real-life microwave structures","coarse grid time-step","dense grids","FDTD update equations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD methods","numerical stability","digital filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A spatial filter-enabled high-resolution subgridding scheme for stable FDTD modeling of multiscale geometries","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12240711","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spatial filter-enabled high-resolution subgridding scheme for stable FDTD modeling of multiscale geometries","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1677KL3WrrUoXbGf2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064166S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5972919,"authors":[{"name":"Waleed Alomar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Waleed","lastName":"Alomar","id":"38348686300"},{"name":"Amir Mortazawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Mortazawi","id":"37268771000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972919","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":555},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Transistors","Gain","Power measurement","Power generation","Frequency measurement","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","power MOSFET","VHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high voltage high power class-E power amplifier","HiVP","four stage cascoded class-E power amplifier","flanged LDMOS transistors","drain voltage","maximum drain voltage swing","efficiency 69 percent","gain 30.1 dB","power 51.8 W","frequency 150 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aluminum Oxide","class-E","high voltage / high power (HiVP)","power amplifiers","thermal management of electronics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972919","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972919.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high voltage high power (HiVP) class-E power amplifier at VHF","abstract":"A four stage cascoded class-E power amplifier based on a high voltage / high power technique (HiVP) technique has been designed and implemented.

We present a temporal and spatial sampling method of measuring the rapid temporal evolution of an electronically steerable antenna's near- and far-field radiation pattern, which allows for time-domain measurement of the radiation pattern of an antenna at relevantly short timescales and over an arbitrarily large solid angle. An experimental validation of the method is reported, in which an azimuth-plane measurement of a phased-array antenna captures the transient far-field radiation pattern as the antenna switches its main-beam scanning angle with 7-nanosecond time resolution.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972953","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972953.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of time-evolving electronically steerable radiation patterns at fast timescales by a sampling technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of time-evolving electronically steerable radiation patterns at fast timescales by a sampling technique","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972953/","accessionNumber":"12180835","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972953/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of time-evolving electronically steerable radiation patterns at fast timescales by a sampling technique","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1755KL4DApGgTlGd2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040419S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5972955,"authors":[{"name":"Zach Griffith","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific and Imaging, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zach","lastName":"Griffith","id":"37270329500"},{"name":"Miguel Urteaga","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific and Imaging, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Urteaga","id":"37270267300"},{"name":"Richard Pierson","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific and Imaging, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Pierson","id":"37269031500"},{"name":"Petra Rowell","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific and Imaging, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Petra","lastName":"Rowell","id":"37269024000"},{"name":"Mark Rodwell","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Rodwell","id":"37270330900"},{"name":"Bobby Brar","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific and Imaging, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bobby","lastName":"Brar","id":"37305004500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-757-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-754-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-755-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-756-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5972955","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Bandwidth","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Distortion measurement","Noise","Noise measurement","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback amplifiers","heterojunction bipolar transistors","indium compounds","millimetre wave amplifiers","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-stage shunt-feedback op-amp","operational amplifier","simple-Miller compensation","HBT technology","waveform clipping","gain 19.2 dB","power 1020 mW","frequency 350 GHz","size 0.5 mum","noise figure 5.5 dB","frequency 8.5 GHz","InP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Operational-amplifier","Shunt-feedback","Miller compensation","distortion suppression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972955","abstract":"We report here a 3-stage shunt-feedback configured operational amplifier using simple-Miller compensation demonstrating 19.2dB mid-band S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n gain, P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DC</sub>\n = 1020mW.

Almost 40\u00b0 of beam-steering at 2.5GHz was measured in 2D space for the 2\u00d72 array and more than 15dB suppression of the first and third harmonic compared to the desired second harmonic was measured in the radiated far-field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12189629","htmlLink":"/document/5972981/","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Active Radiator arrays for efficient doubling, filtering, and beam-forming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Active Radiator arrays for efficient doubling, filtering, and beam-forming","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1805KL3E9JTsSaWe2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045222S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5972983,"authors":[{"name":"Dongying Li","affiliation":["Edward S.

Therefore, there is a need for innovating existing algorithms for nonlinear problems, especially the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method which is particularly suitable for nonlinear structure analysis. To this end, a numerical methodology based on a recently introduced spatially filtered FDTD technique is presented and applied to nonlinear pulse propagation studies. It is demonstrated that the method is significantly faster than the standard nonlinear FDTD, while maintaining its level of accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972983","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959906/5972556/05972983.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-domain modeling of nonlinear pulse propagation with an extended stability spatially filtered FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5972983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5972983/","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain modeling of nonlinear pulse propagation with an extended stability spatially filtered FDTD method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180861","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5972983/","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain modeling of nonlinear pulse propagation with an extended stability spatially filtered FDTD method","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"1811KL4NVaMiYtNa2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0611S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959906","isNumber":"5972556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959906","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5972556","articleId":"5972983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5973140,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Although studies about ACD-based NN controller have been made on nonlinear systems, little is known about the more complicate nonaffine nonlinear systems. Because the nonlinear functions of nonaffine nonlinear systems are implicit functions with respect to the control, existing ACD methods can not been applied directly. Instead of approximating the nonaffine nonlinear function, we proposed that an action NN is employed to approximate the derived unknown uncertain term. Additionally, a robust term is developed to attenuate the NN reconstruction errors. Moreover, novel tuning laws for the weights of action NN and critic NN and the adaptive parameter are derived to guarantee the uniformly ultimate boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop system by Lyapunov method. By developing a novel Lyapunov function candidate and using adaptive bounding technique, no a prior knowledge of bounds of the time derivative of the control effectiveness term, the NN ideal weights of action NN and critic NN and the reconstruction errors is required. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICMIC.2011.5973712","startPage":"261","endPage":"266","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMIC.2011.5973712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5973660","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/5961157/5973660/05973712.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive critic design based robust neural network control for a class of continuous-time nonaffine nonlinear system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5973712/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive critic design based robust neural network control for a class of continuous-time nonaffine nonlinear system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5973712/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12170960","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive critic design based robust neural network control for a class of continuous-time nonaffine nonlinear system","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"MonB044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07181S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5961157","isNumber":"5973660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5961157","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5973660","articleId":"5973712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5973734,"authors":[{"name":"Rongfang Li","affiliation":["Jiangxi Provincal Institute of Water Sciences, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"firstName":"Rongfang","lastName":"Li","id":"37964726300"},{"name":"Lijun Cheng","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37538952600"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716316900"},{"name":"Yongsheng Ding","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Engineering Research Center of Digitized Textile & Fashion Technology, Ministry of Education, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37277996600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9567157-0-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5973734","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rivers","Reservoirs","Optimal scheduling","Biological system modeling","Collaboration","Job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","rivers","scheduling","water resources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","collaborative optimal scheduling","multi-level water basin","nonflood season","water resource optimization","river","water control system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5973734","abstract":"Water resource optimization has become an important issue due to water shortage in recent years.

According to the definition set out in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), the confidential section of the electronic medical record needs to be protected. Thus, a mechanism to protect the patient's privacy is needed during electronic medical record exchange and sharing. The privacy protection mechanism can be categorized into four types, namely anonymity, pseudonymity, unlinkability, and unobservability. In previous research in this area, mathematical conversions and cross reference tables have been utilized to conceal the confidential part of the electronic medical record to achieve privacy protection. However, it is harder to use these methods with respect to the unlinkability and unobservability mechanisms. Thus, this paper tries to improve on this aspect, and improves the unlinkability mechanism between the patient and the electronic medical record. Cloud computing is known for its fast computation capability and provides large storage space. Through cloud computing, the electronic medical record system in a hospital can be integrated, to facilitate the exchange and sharing of electronic medical records, and to provide smaller hospitals or clinics that have fewer resources with adequate electronic medical record storage space.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962398/5973167/05973792.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5973167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5973792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A secure electronic medical record sharing mechanism in the cloud computing platform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hospitals","Biomedical imaging","Cloud computing","Privacy","Indexes","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","medical information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure electronic medical record sharing mechanism","cloud computing","patient privacy","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act","HIPPA","privacy protection mechanism","anonymity","pseudonymity","unlinkability mechanism","unobservability mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electronic Medical Record","Cloud Computing","Privacy","Security","Anonymity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5973792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A secure electronic medical record sharing mechanism in the cloud computing platform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5973792/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12171756","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A secure electronic medical record sharing mechanism in the cloud computing platform","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052952S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962398","isNumber":"5973167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962398","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5973167","articleId":"5973792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5973804,"authors":[{"name":"Sue-Chen Hsueh","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Chao Yang University of Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sue-Chen","lastName":"Hsueh","id":"37666925300"},{"name":"Jing-Yan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Chao Yang University of Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jing-Yan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37962546100"},{"name":"Ming-Yen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Feng Chia University FCU, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Yen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37674675900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-842-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-843-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-841-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0747-668X"}],"articleNumber":"5973804","dbTime":"59 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":874},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Coplanar waveguides","Cloud computing","Authentication","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","digital signatures","mobile computing","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure cloud storage","data archive","smart phone","cloud services","periodical data backup","mobile client","wireless cloud storage","hybrid cryptography","digital signature","mobile phone"]}],"abstract":"The importance of the data stored in the smart phones is increased as more applications are deployed and executed. Once the smart phone is damaged or lost, the valuable information treasured in the device is lost altogether. If cloud storage can be integrated with cloud services for periodical data backup of a mobile client, the risk of data lost can be minimized. However, the important data might be uncovered by a malicious third party during retrieval or transmission of information using wireless cloud storage without proper authentication and protection. Therefore, in this paper, we design an archive mechanism that integrates cloud storage, hybrid cryptography, and digital signatures to provide security requirements for data storage of mobile phones. Our mechanism not only can avoid malicious attackers from illegal access but also can share desired information with targeted friends by distinct access rights.","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973804","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962398/5973167/05973804.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5973167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure cloud storage for convenient data archive of smart phones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5973804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5973804/","displayDocTitle":"Secure cloud storage for convenient data archive of smart phones","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12171768","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5973804/","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure cloud storage for convenient data archive of smart phones","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044444S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962398","isNumber":"5973167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962398","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5973167","articleId":"5973804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5973834,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngjoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37066728500"},{"name":"Wonkyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonkyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37536465600"},{"name":"Jechang Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jechang","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37278335600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-842-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-843-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-841-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0747-668X"}],"articleNumber":"5973834","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"abstract":"Intra prediction is a significant technique in H.264/AVC reference software.

equalizers. In real-time applications, such filters often require dedicated hardware to meet the timing requirements. Modern FPGAs fulfill the above demand for its excellent flexibility and performance. This paper proposes two different architectures for implementing an NLMS adaptive filtering algorithm, using a 32 bit fixed-point arithmetic representation, on FPGA. These architectures are implemented using the Altera Cyclone II FPGA DE2-70 development board. A pure software implementation of the algorithm is first proposed using NIOS II embedded RISC processor. An FIR filter core is then proposed to implement a HW/SW Co-design architecture with the existing embedded processor. A comparison is made between the two alternative architectures for performance and area usage. Results show a significant improvement in execution time required when implementing with HW/SW Co-design over a pure software implementation.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962398/5973167/05973866.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware/software Co-design of NLMS adaptive filters on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5973167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5973866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5973866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hardware/software Co-design of NLMS adaptive filters on FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12171830","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5973866/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware/software Co-design of NLMS adaptive filters on FPGA","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053154S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962398","isNumber":"5973167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962398","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5973167","articleId":"5973866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5973867,"authors":[{"name":"Song-Nien Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Song-Nien","lastName":"Tang","id":"37394791100"},{"name":"Jui-Wei Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jui-Wei","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37402645300"},{"name":"Tsin-Yuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsin-Yuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279407700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-842-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-843-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-841-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0747-668X"}],"articleNumber":"5973867","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"abstract":"This paper presents an energy-efficient FFT processor providing high throughput rate for wireless personal area network (WPAN).

All variants of the MPEG4 audio coders use a Linear Prediction (LP) filtering system. The LP filter coefficients are calculated based on the Line Spectral Frequencies (LSF) parameters due to their excellent quantization characteristics. This work presents a hardware architecture that implements the conversion of the LSF parameters into the LP coefficients and the LP synthesis filter. The LSF conversion module is based on a simplified algorithm that cuts down on many arithmetic operations and thus results in a low gate count module. The architecture was implemented on Xilinx Virtex5 FPGA platform for performance measurement and verification. Module speeds are reported in terms of the number of clock cycles taken by each of their sub-modules to show suitability for real-time applications. Synthesis results are reported using various degrees of parallelism to explore the trade-off between gate count and time delay. Fixed-point implementation was carried out in a way that kept the original precision of the LSF parameters and input data in order to mitigate the severe impact of the tight bit rate budget.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity, hardware architecture for a parametric, real-time, LSF speech decoder","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973878","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962398/5973167/05973878.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5973167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5973878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5973878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity, hardware architecture for a parametric, real-time, LSF speech decoder","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5973878/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12171842","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity, hardware architecture for a parametric, real-time, LSF speech decoder","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067631S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962398","isNumber":"5973167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962398","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5973167","articleId":"5973878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5973895,"authors":[{"name":"Anurag Gupta","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Design, Brunei University, West London, UK"],"firstName":"Anurag","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37961575400"},{"name":"Afandi Ahmad","affiliation":["JEC, Faculty of.

These memories have the capability to store multiple numbers of bits per cell, thus increasing the capacity with minimal effect on hardware. This increase, however, comes at the price of reliability; more bits per cell results in more chances of error and thus less reliability. Error control coding is widely employed to improve the reliability of data that has been read. This paper proposes a new scheme for error correction in multilevel cell memories. The process involves splitting the contents of the memory cells into i symbols and assigning them to i different codewords. Encoding and decoding are performed using the same code but over i iterations. The scheme exhibits an apparent error correction advantage over polyvalent-based schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973902","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962398/5973167/05973902.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5973167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2011.5973902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error control coding for multi-level cell memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5973902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Error control coding for multi-level cell memories","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5973902/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12171865","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error control coding for multi-level cell memories","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05792S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962398","isNumber":"5973167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962398","xplore-issue":"5973167","articleId":"5973902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5973903,"authors":[{"name":"Shih Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih","lastName":"Kang","id":"37534870300"},{"name":"Shih-Yang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Yang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37966009300"},{"name":"Wai-Chi Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wai-Chi","lastName":"Fang","id":"37274389600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-842-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-843-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-841-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0747-668X"}],"articleNumber":"5973903","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","US Department of Transportation","System-on-a-chip","Biomedical optical imaging","Computer architecture","Optical imaging","Absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","computerised tomography","image reconstruction","integrated circuit design","medical image processing","optical tomography","portable instruments","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced green energy system-on-chip design","portable computed tomography system","semiconductor manufacturing technology","portable diffuse optical tomography technology","biomedicine","breast cancer detection","oxygenated hemoglobin distribution observation","low-cost continuous wave near-infrared DOT system","portable biomedical system-on-a-chip","SoC","CW-NIR DOT system","image reconstruction","two-dimensional post-processing technique"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, the rapid development of semiconductor manufacturing technology has made possible the large scale design and integration of many system level applications into a single chip. In this paper, we propose a portable computed tomography (CT) system to provide the general public easy access to a basic type of health check-up outside the hospital setting. The designed system employs diffuse optical tomography (DOT) technology, a technology which has found many successful applications in the field of biomedicine, such as breast cancer detection and observation of oxygenated hemoglobin distribution in the brain. In this paper, we develop a low-cost continuous wave near-infrared (CW-NIR) DOT system, paving the way for practical solutions in portable biomedical system-on-a-chip (SoC) applications.

Various non-cooperative power control games have been presented to maximize the utility of users. Based on the game proposed by Goodman et al., a pricing function related to the radio of signal to interference is presented in this paper, which generates different revenue for different CR users to guarantee the equity so that CR users may get higher utility. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium is proved for the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm can reduce the users' transmit power and improve its utility in comparison with the power control algorithm via pricing based on power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5974552/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12226359","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5974552/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power control game based on new pricing function for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control game based on new pricing function for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"AS47466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107806S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959270","isNumber":"5972016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5972016","articleId":"5974552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5974695,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Ling","affiliation":["School of Management & Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Haifeng Ling","id":"37962213400"},{"name":"Xianzhong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Management & Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xianzhong Zhou","id":"37406427000"},{"name":"Yihong Xiao","affiliation":["School of Management & Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yihong Xiao","id":"37961174800"},{"name":"Xunlin Jiang","affiliation":["Engineering Institute of Engineering Corps, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xunlin Jiang","id":"37960874300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9763-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9762-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9761-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5974695","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Maintenance engineering","Measurement","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO algorithm","constrained multiobjective optimization problem","CMOP","Pareto dominance","nondominated solution set maintenance strategy","Pareto-optimal set","Pareto-optimal solution searching method","velocity adjustment strategy","position adjustment strategy","particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-object problems(MOP)","constrained multiobjective particle swarm optimization(CMOPSO)","Pareto-optimal solution searching","archive maintenance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5974695","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an improved PSO algorithm for solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOP).

The most simply method of lip reading in early stage is to compare between characters from the frozen pictures and templates being stored. It neglects the character is changing with time. This method is very simply, but it only can classify the simple elements not the words, so it couldn't render great serves to speech recognition. Afterwards the adoption of behavioral characteristics is becoming more widespread. Because of the superior of Hidden Markov model (HMM), it can be applied in speech recognition widely. In recent years, it is also used in the research of lip-reading recognition. The classical HMM model makes two hypotheses: hidden expropriation hypothesis: the state at t+1 is only conditioned by the state at t, not the state before; the expropriation hypothesis from hidden state to visible state: the visible state at t only conditioned by the hidden state at t, not the state before. Such kind of hypothesis is not very reasonable in some practical application (such as lip-reading). In some kind condition, the state at t is not only conditioned by t-1, but also t-2.

The simulation results show the effectiveness of this improved MMSE-MUD algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CSSS.2011.5974945","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Service System (CSSS)","startPage":"2055","endPage":"2058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSSS.2011.5974945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5972016","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959270/5972016/05974945.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Service System (CSSS)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Bit error rate","Multiaccess communication","Vectors","Error probability","Convergence","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","code division multiple access","communication complexity","error statistics","estimation theory","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple access interference suppression","near-far problem","code division multiple access system","minimum mean square error-MUD algorithm","approximate estimation","computation complexity","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MAI","MUD","MMSE-MUD","FNP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An improved MMSE-MUD algorithm for MAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5974945/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5974945/","accessionNumber":"12226748","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved MMSE-MUD algorithm for MAI","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"AS84986.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052527S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959270","isNumber":"5972016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5972016","articleId":"5974945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5974982,"authors":[{"name":"Yaqing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Yaqing Wang","id":"37966594200"},{"name":"Shangbo Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Shangbo Zhou","id":"37276855000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9763-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9762-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9761-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5974982","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"abstract":"A new approach of digital image encryption is proposed based on the fractional Fourier transform and chaos.

In the second experiment, short videos and images were shown once without any tag and then with correct or incorrect tags. Agreement or disagreement with the displayed tags was assessed by the participants. The recorded videos and bodily responses were segmented and stored in a database.

During the transmission period of a secondary connection, multiple interruptions from the primary users result in multiple spectrum handoffs and the need of predetermining a set of target channels for spectrum handoffs. To quantify the effects of channel obsolete issue on the target channel predetermination, we should consider the three key design features: 1) general service time distribution of the primary and secondary connections; 2) different operating channels in multiple handoffs; and 3) queuing delay due to channel contention from multiple secondary connections. To this end, we propose the preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queuing network model to characterize the spectrum usage behaviors with all the three design features. This model aims to analyze the extended data delivery time of the secondary connections with proactively designed target channel sequences under various traffic arrival rates and service time distributions. These analytical results are applied to evaluate the latency performance of the connection-based spectrum handoff based on the target channel sequences mentioned in the IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks standard. Then, to reduce the extended data delivery time, a traffic-adaptive spectrum handoff is proposed, which changes the target channel sequence of spectrum handoffs based on traffic conditions. Compared to the existing target channel selection methods, this traffic-adaptive target channel selection approach can reduce the extended data transmission time by 35 percent, especially for the heavy traffic loads of the primary users.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6247413/05975147.pdf","startPage":"1499","endPage":"1513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6247413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis for Spectrum Handoffs in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975147/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis for Spectrum Handoffs in Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"11","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975147/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis for Spectrum Handoffs in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2012091499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054419S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","isNumber":"6247413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"129","articleId":"5975147","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5975148,"authors":[{"name":"Rob Miller","affiliation":["Rutgers University, Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB), Freehold, NJ"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6226889/5975148/5975148-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rob Miller received the BS degree in computer systems engineering from Boston University in 2000, the MS degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University in 2001, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from Rutgers University in 2011.

In order to realize any gains over traditional non-MIMO communication systems, these systems must possess accurate knowledge of the wireless channel. In this paper, we investigate strategies for disrupting MIMO communications by developing attacks that target the often overlooked, but essential, channel estimation procedure. Our study focuses on the two most popular and well-known MIMO techniques: the capacity achieving SVD-based MIMO scheme, and the Alamouti space-time block code (STBC), which spans many protocols including 802.11n, WiMAX, and 3GPP. We augment theoretical and simulation results with real-world experimentation using the USRP/GNU Radio software defined radio platform. We also present novel methodology to protect the channel estimation procedure from such attacks by embedding authentication messages into physical layer features of the transmissions.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6226889/05975148.pdf","startPage":"1386","endPage":"1398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6226889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Vulnerabilities of CSI in MIMO Wireless Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975148/","displayDocTitle":"On the Vulnerabilities of CSI in MIMO Wireless Communication Systems","volume":"11","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975148/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Vulnerabilities of CSI in MIMO Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"ttm2012081386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108214S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6226889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6226889","articleId":"5975148","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5975151,"authors":[{"name":"Anfu Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Anfu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37529000200"},{"name":"Min Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085586883"},{"name":"Zhongcheng Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongcheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085591250"},{"name":"Eryk Dutkiewicz","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Eryk","lastName":"Dutkiewicz","id":"38299196300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"5975151","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":946},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Wireless networks","Throughput","Approximation methods","Computational modeling","Markov processes","Mathematical programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CSMA","topology asymmetry","fairness","mathematical modeling","decoupling approximation."]}],"abstract":"Recent studies reveal that the main cause of the well-known unfairness problem in wireless networks is the ineffective coordination of CSMA-based random access due to topology asymmetry. In this paper, we take a modeling-based approach to understand and solve the unfairness problem. Compared to existing works, we advance the state of the art in two important ways. First, we propose an analytical model called the G-Model, which accurately characterizes the ineffective coordination of medium access in asymmetrical topologies. The G-Model can estimate network performance under arbitrary parameter configurations. Second, while previous works decompose a wireless network into embedded basic asymmetric topologies and study each basic topology separately, we go beyond the basic asymmetrical topology and design a model-driven optimization method called Flow Level Adjusting (FLA) to solve the unfairness problem for larger wireless networks. Through extensive simulations, we validate the proposed G-Model and show that FLA can greatly improve the overall fairness of wireless networks in which basic asymmetric topologies are embedded.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6247413/05975151.pdf","startPage":"1559","endPage":"1571","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6247413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Optimization of Medium Access in CSMA Wireless Networks with Topology Asymmetry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Optimization of Medium Access in CSMA Wireless Networks with Topology Asymmetry","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Optimization of Medium Access in CSMA Wireless Networks with Topology Asymmetry","sourcePdf":"ttm2012091559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049787S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","isNumber":"6247413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5975151","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5975165,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Dollar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6155150/5975165/5975165-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Piotr Doll\u00e1r received the master's degree in computer science from Harvard University in 2002 and the PhD degree from the University of California, San Diego, in 2007.

In recent years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has grown steadily. However, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols are used, making direct comparisons difficult. To address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. We make three primary contributions: 1) We put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. Our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. Our experiments show that despite significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement. In particular, detection is disappointing at low resolutions and for partially occluded pedestrians.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","volume":"34","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12543266","pubMedId":"21808091","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5975165/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art","sourcePdf":"ttp2012040743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187414S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6155150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1773","xplore-issue":"6155150","articleId":"5975165","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5975166,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Mairal","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6155150/5975166/5975166-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Julien Mairal received the graduate degree from the Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France, in 2005, and the PhD degree from the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Cachan, France, in 2010 under the supervision of Jean Ponce and Francis Bach in the INRIA Willow project team in Paris.

For signals such as natural images that admit such sparse representations, it is now well established that these models are well suited to restoration tasks. In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult. In this paper, we present a general formulation for supervised dictionary learning adapted to a wide variety of tasks, and present an efficient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on handwritten digit classification, digital art identification, nonlinear inverse image problems, and compressed sensing demonstrate that our approach is effective in large-scale settings, and is well suited to supervised and semi-supervised classification, as well as regression tasks for data that admit sparse representations.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975166","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Sparse matrices","Vectors","Sensors","Cost function","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data models","handwritten character recognition","image classification","image representation","image restoration","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix decomposition","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task-driven dictionary learning","data modeling","linear combinations","learned dictionary","machine learning","neuroscience","signal processing","natural images","sparse representations","restoration tasks","large-scale matrix factorization problem","classical optimization tools","image classification","supervised dictionary learning","handwritten digit classification","digital art identification","nonlinear inverse image problems","compressed sensing","semisupervised classification","regression tasks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Basis pursuit","Lasso","dictionary learning","matrix factorization","semi-supervised learning","compressed sensing."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Humans","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6155150/05975166.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.156","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task-Driven Dictionary Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975166/","displayDocTitle":"Task-Driven Dictionary Learning","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543267","pubMedId":"21808090","htmlLink":"/document/5975166/","volume":"34","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task-Driven Dictionary Learning","sourcePdf":"ttp2012040791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154069S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6155150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"561","xplore-issue":"6155150","articleId":"5975166","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5975168,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Prest","affiliation":["LEAR team, INRIA Rhone-Alpes, Saint-Ismier, France","Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6136512/5975168/5975168-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Prest received the MSc cum laude in computer science from the University of Udine in July 2007.

Our approach is human-centric: We first localize a human in the image and then determine the object relevant for the action and its spatial relation with the human. The model is learned automatically from a set of still images annotated only with the action label. Our approach relies on a human detector to initialize the model learning. For robustness to various degrees of visibility, we build a detector that learns to combine a set of existing part detectors. Starting from humans detected in a set of images depicting the action, our approach determines the action object and its spatial relation to the human. Its final output is a probabilistic model of the human-object interaction, i.e., the spatial relation between the human and the object. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on the sports action data set from [1], the PASCAL Action 2010 data set [2], and a new human-object interaction data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5975168/","accessionNumber":"12487345","pubMedId":"21808083","displayDocTitle":"Weakly Supervised Learning of Interactions between Humans and Objects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weakly Supervised Learning of Interactions between Humans and Objects","sourcePdf":"ttp2012030601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087791S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6136512","articleId":"5975168","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5975198,"authors":[{"name":"Anca A.

Thus, targets are not any more observed in isolation, instead the groups of objects, e.g., house, bridge, and road, etc., need to be recognized in their spatial context. This paper proposes a feature extraction method for image patches in order to capture the spatial context. The method is based on the characteristics of the spectra of the SAR data, integrating radiometric, geometric, and texture properties of the SAR image patch. The method is demonstrated for TerraSAR-X High Resolution Spotlight data. To account for the spatial context in which a group of targets is located, it uses an image patch covering typically 200 \u00d7 200m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n of the scene. A comparative evaluation of our descriptors and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features has been performed over a database of 6916 patches. The method allowed for the robust recognition of over 30 different scene classes, with precision between 50% and 93%. Numerical results show that our method is able to discriminate between scene classes better than GLCM texture parameters.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2160838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6109854/05975198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2160838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6109854","startPage":"80","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contextual Descriptors for Scene Classes in Very High Resolution SAR Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Contextual Descriptors for Scene Classes in Very High Resolution SAR Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425840","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5975198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contextual Descriptors for Scene Classes in Very High Resolution SAR Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-popescu-2160838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075192S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6109854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6109854","articleId":"5975198","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5975200,"authors":[{"name":"Sunghwan Kim","affiliation":["School of EE, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Rep. of Korea (South Korea)"],"firstName":"Sunghwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"38541389700"},{"name":"Sung-Yoon Jung","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea (South Korea)"],"firstName":"Sung-Yoon","lastName":"Jung","id":"37403823100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5975200","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1432},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a novel forward error correction (FEC) coding method using a modified Reed-Muller (RM) code for providing accurate dimming control in on-off keying (OOK) based visible light communication (VLC) systems.

Therefore, it can contain minimal compensation symbols in supporting multiple dimming target values. Moreover, VLC with our proposed scheme provides more coding gain than VLC scheme with the conventional FEC codes [the first-order RM and Reed-Solomon (RS) codes].

However, the unwanted movements of their hands typically blur and introduce disturbing jerkiness in the recorded sequences. Many video stabilization techniques have been hence developed with different performances but only fast strategies can be implemented on embedded devices. A fundamental issue is the overall robustness with respect to different scene contents (indoor, outdoor, etc.) and conditions (illumination changes, moving objects, etc.). In this paper, we propose a fast and robust image alignment algorithm for video stabilization purposes. Our contribution is twofold: a fast and accurate block-based local motion estimator together with a robust alignment algorithm based on voting.

In GDWM, the watermark bits are embedded by quantizing the angles of significant gradient vectors at multiple wavelet scales. The proposed scheme has the following advantages: 1) increased invisibility of the embedded watermark because the watermark is embedded in significant gradient vectors, 2) robustness to amplitude scaling attacks because the watermark is embedded in the angles of the gradient vectors, and 3) increased watermarking capacity as the scheme uses multiple-scale embedding. The gradient vector at a pixel is expressed in terms of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients. To quantize the gradient direction, the DWT coefficients are modified based on the derived relationship between the changes in the coefficients and the change in the gradient direction. Experimental results show that the proposed GDWM outperforms other watermarking methods and is robust to a wide range of attacks, e.g., Gaussian filtering, amplitude scaling, median filtering, sharpening, JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, salt & pepper noise, and scaling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Quantization","Discrete wavelet transforms","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","embedded systems","gradient methods","image watermarking","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust image watermarking","multiscale gradient direction quantization","robust quantization-based image watermarking scheme","gradient direction watermarking","GDWM","uniform quantization","watermark bits","significant gradient vectors","multiple wavelet scales","embedded watermark","amplitude scaling attacks","watermarking capacity","multiple-scale embedding","discrete wavelet transform coefficients","DWT coefficients","watermarking methods","Gaussian filtering","median filtering","sharpening","JPEG compression","Gaussian noise","salt & pepper noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude scaling attacks","digital watermarking","gradient direction quantization","quantization-based watermarking"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2163627","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6069499/05975215.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2163627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Image Watermarking Based on Multiscale Gradient Direction Quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Image Watermarking Based on Multiscale Gradient Direction Quantization","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12359898","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","volume":"6","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975215/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Image Watermarking Based on Multiscale Gradient Direction Quantization","sourcePdf":"tifs-nezhadarya-2163627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125788S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6069499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6069499","articleId":"5975215","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":5975218,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6129825/5975218/5975218-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaolin Wu (SM'96\u2013F'10) received the B.Sc. degree from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1982 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, in 1988, both in computer science.","He started his academic career in 1988 and has since been with the faculty at the University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada; New York Polytechnic University, Brooklyn; and, currently, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, where he is a Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and where he holds the NSERC-DALSA Industrial Research Chair in Digital Cinema.

Since many natural signals such as images have locally varying statistics, the sparse space varies in time/spatial domain. As such, CS recovery should be conducted in locally adaptive signal-dependent spaces to counter the fact that the CS measurements are global and irrespective of signal structures. On the contrary, existing CS reconstruction methods use a fixed set of bases (e.g., wavelets, DCT, and gradient spaces) for the entirety of a signal. To rectify this problem, we propose a new framework for model-guided adaptive recovery of compressive sensing (MARX) and show how a 2-D piecewise autoregressive model can be integrated into the MARX framework to make CS recovery adaptive to spatially varying second order statistics of an image. In addition, MARX offers a mechanism of characterizing and exploiting structured sparsities of natural images, greatly restricting the CS solution space. Simulation results over a wide range of natural images show that the proposed MARX technique can improve the reconstruction quality of existing CS methods by 2-7 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2163520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6129825/05975218.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2163520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Assisted Adaptive Recovery of Compressed Sensing with Imaging Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975218/","displayDocTitle":"Model-Assisted Adaptive Recovery of Compressed Sensing with Imaging Applications","volume":"21","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12472201","pubMedId":"21824848","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975218/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Assisted Adaptive Recovery of Compressed Sensing with Imaging Applications","sourcePdf":"tip-wu-2163520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072528S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6129825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6129825","articleId":"5975218","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5975219,"authors":[{"name":"Farhad Aghili","affiliation":["Canadian Space Agency, Saint-Hubert, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6301724/5975219/5975219-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farhad Aghili (SM\u201907) received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering and the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1988 and 1991, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in February 1998.","During 1994\u20131997, he was a Research Engineer at MPB Technologies, Montreal. in January 1998, he joined the Canadian Space Agency.

The observability analysis reveals that 1) integration of a single GPS with IMU does not constitute an observable system; and 2) integration of two GPS units with IMU results in a locally observable system provided that the line connecting two GPS antennas is not parallel with the vector of the measured acceleration, i.e., the sum of inertial and gravitational accelerations. The latter case makes it possible to compensate the error in the estimated orientation due to gyro drift and its bias without needing additional instrument for absolute orientation measurements, e.g., magnetic compass. Moreover, in order to cope with the fact that GPS systems sometimes lose their signal and receive inaccurate position data, the self-tuning filter estimates the covariance matrix associated with the GPS measurement noise. This allows the KF to incorporate GPS measurements in the data fusion process heavily only when the information received by GPS becomes reliably available. Finally, test results obtained from a mobile robot moving across uneven terrain demonstrate driftless 3-D pose estimation.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2161485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6301724","startPage":"21","endPage":"31","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6301724/05975219.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2161485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driftless 3-D Attitude Determination and Positioning of Mobile Robots By Integration of IMU With Two RTK GPSs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Observability","Noise","Mobile robots","Vehicles","Quaternions","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filters","covariance matrices","filtering theory","Global Positioning System","mobile robots","pose estimation","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driftless 3D attitude determination","mobile robots","IMU","RTK GPS","inertial measurement unit","real-time kinematic global positioning system","adaptive Kalman filter","driftless estimation","vehicle attitude","vehicle position","estimated orientation","gyro drift","self-tuning filter","covariance matrix","data fusion process","driftless 3D pose estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attitude determination","global positioning system","global positioning system-inertial measurement unit (GPS-IMU) integration","inertial measurement unit","Kalman filtering","localization of mobile robots","navigation of vehicles","pose estimation","real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Driftless 3-D Attitude Determination and Positioning of Mobile Robots By Integration of IMU With Two RTK GPSs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975219/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5975219/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12982040","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driftless 3-D Attitude Determination and Positioning of Mobile Robots By Integration of IMU With Two RTK GPSs","sourcePdf":"tmech-aghili-2161485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093941S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6301724","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6301724","articleId":"5975219","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5975222,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Lian","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6032791/5975222/5975222-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Lian (M'10) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control theory and control engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.","She is currently a Lecturer with the Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.

Due to this property of the transmitted signal, linear power amplifiers (class A, B, or AB) are usually used as a solution for the power amplifier stage. These amplifiers have high linearity, but suffer from low efficiency when the transmitted signal has high peak-to-average power ratio. The Kahn envelope elimination and restoration technique is used to enhance the efficiency of RF transmitters, by combining highly efficient, nonlinear RF amplifier (class E) with a highly efficient envelope amplifier in order to obtain a linear and highly efficient RF amplifier. This paper presents a solution for the envelope amplifier based on a multilevel converter in series with a linear regulator. The multilevel converter is implemented by employing voltage dividers based on switching capacitors. The implemented envelope amplifier can reproduce any signal with a maximum spectral component of 2 MHz and give instantaneous maximum power of 50 W. The efficiency measurements show that when the signals with low average value are transmitted, the implemented prototypes have up to 20% higher efficiency than linear regulators used as a conventional solution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2163646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6144184/05975225.pdf","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1368","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2163646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Envelope Amplifier Based on Switching Capacitors for High-Efficiency RF Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Envelope Amplifier Based on Switching Capacitors for High-Efficiency RF Amplifiers","volume":"27","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5975225/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524201","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Envelope Amplifier Based on Switching Capacitors for High-Efficiency RF Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tpel-vasic-2163646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077859S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6144184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6144184","articleId":"5975225","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5975229,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Kai Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6077122/5975229/5975229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Kai Lin was born in Keelung, Taiwan.

Since ECC demands the storage of coding redundancy and hence degrades effective cell storage efficiency, it is highly desirable to use more powerful coding solutions that can maintain the system storage reliability at less coding redundancy. This has motivated a growing interest in the industry to search for alternatives to BCH code being used in today. Regardless to specific ECCs, it is of great practical importance to know the theoretical limit on the achievable cell storage efficiency, which motivates this work. We first develop an approximate NAND flash memory channel model that explicitly incorporates program/erase (P/E) cycling effects and cell-to-cell interference, based on which we then develop strategies for estimating the information-theoretical bounds on cell storage efficiency. We show that it can readily reveal the tradeoffs among cell storage efficiency, P/E cycling endurance, and retention limit, which can provide important insights for system designers. Finally, motivated by the dynamics of P/E cycling effect revealed by the information-theoretical study, we propose two memory system design techniques that can improve the average NAND flash memory programming speed and increase the total amount of user data that can be stored in NAND flash cell over its entire lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2160747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2160747","startPage":"1705","endPage":"1714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6236332/05975232.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6236332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating Information-Theoretical nand Flash Memory Storage Capacity and its Implication to Memory System Design Space Exploration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Information-Theoretical nand Flash Memory Storage Capacity and its Implication to Memory System Design Space Exploration","volume":"20","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12862744","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5975232/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Information-Theoretical nand Flash Memory Storage Capacity and its Implication to Memory System Design Space Exploration","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-dong-2160747-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180209S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6236332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6236332","articleId":"5975232","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5975251,"authors":[{"name":"Bishnu Prasad Das","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/6045016/5975251/5975251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bishnu Prasad Das received the M.Sc. degree in electronics from Sambalpur University, Orissa, India, in 1999, the M.Tech. degree in computer application from the Indian School of Mines, Dhanabad, India, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2009.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher with Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

In this paper, we propose a single delay model of logic gate using neural network which comprehensively captures process, voltage, and temperature variation along with input slew and output load. The number of simulation programs with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) required to create this model over a large voltage and temperature range is found to be modest and 4\u00d7 less than that required for a conventional table-based approach with comparable accuracy. We show how the model can be used to derive sensitivities required for linear SSTA for an arbitrary voltage and temperature. Our experimentation on ISCAS 85 benchmarks across a voltage range of 0.9-1.1 V shows that the average error in mean delay is less than 1.08% and average error in standard deviation is less than 2.85%. The errors in predicting the 99% and 1% probability point are 1.31% and 1%, respectively, with respect to SPICE. The two potential applications of voltage-aware SSTA have been presented, i.e., one for improving the accuracy of timing analysis by considering instance-specific voltage drops in power grids and the other for determining optimum supply voltage for target yield for dynamic voltage scaling applications.","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2011.2163532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/6045016/05975251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2011.2163532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045016","startPage":"533","endPage":"544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage and Temperature-Aware SSTA Using Neural Network Delay Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Voltage and Temperature-Aware SSTA Using Neural Network Delay Model","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328346","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5975251/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage and Temperature-Aware SSTA Using Neural Network Delay Model","sourcePdf":"tsm-das-2163532-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103141S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"6045016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6045016","articleId":"5975251","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5975252,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Bertrand","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT-SCD), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6041052/5975252/5975252-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexander Bertrand (M'08) received the M.Sc. degree and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, both from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow of the Research Foundation\u2014Flanders (FWO), affiliated with the Electrical Engineering Department (ESAT) of Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

We consider the case where there is stationary additive colored noise on both the regressors and the output response, which results in biased local least-squares estimators. Assuming that the noise covariance can be estimated (or is known a priori), we first propose a bias-compensated recursive least-squares algorithm (BC-RLS). However, this bias compensation increases the variance or the mean-square deviation (MSD) of the local estimators, and errors in the noise covariance estimates may still result in residual bias. We demonstrate that the MSD and residual bias can then be significantly reduced by applying diffusion adaptation, i.e., by letting nodes combine their local estimates with those of their neighbors. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for mean-square stability of the algorithm, under some mild assumptions. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for its steady-state mean and mean-square performance. Simulation results are provided, which agree well with the theoretical results. We also consider some special cases where the mean-square stability improvement of diffusion BC-RLS over BC-RLS can be mathematically verified.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2163631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6041052/05975252.pdf","startPage":"5212","endPage":"5224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2163631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusion Bias-Compensated RLS Estimation Over Adaptive Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975252/","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion Bias-Compensated RLS Estimation Over Adaptive Networks","volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288329","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975252/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion Bias-Compensated RLS Estimation Over Adaptive Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-bertrand-2163631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141721S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6041052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6041052","articleId":"5975252","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5975253,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Naderi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ecole Polytechnique, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6041052/5975253/5975253-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Naderi received the B.A.Sc. degree from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2000, the M.A.Sc. degree from Urmia University, Urmia, Iran, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2008, all in electrical engineering.","He was Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, from 2008 to 2010.

The robotic system is made up of an embedded controller and a robotic hand module which can be adjusted to fit for different finger length. Eight chronic stroke subjects had been recruited to evaluate the effects of this device. The preliminary results showed significant improvement in hand functions (ARAT) and upper limb functions (FMA) after 20 sessions of robot-assisted hand functions task training. With the use of this light and portable robotic device, stroke patients can now practice more easily for the opening and closing of their hands at their own will, and handle functional daily living tasks at ease. A video is included together with this paper to give a demonstration of the hand robotic system on chronic stroke subjects and it will be presented in the conference.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5961155/5975334/05975340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EMG-driven exoskeleton hand robotic training device on chronic stroke subjects: Task training system for stroke rehabilitation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Training","Electromyography","Fingers","Exoskeletons","Muscles","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","medical disorders","medical robotics","patient rehabilitation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMG-driven exoskeleton hand robotic training device","chronic stroke","task training system","stroke rehabilitation","muscle signal","surface electromyography","hand opening functional task","hand closing functional task","embedded controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["exoskeleton","rehabilitation","robot","hand","stroke"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Electromyography","Female","Hand","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Robotics","Robotics","Stroke"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"An EMG-driven exoskeleton hand robotic training device on chronic stroke subjects: Task training system for stroke rehabilitation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975340/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12172960","pubMedId":"22275545","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EMG-driven exoskeleton hand robotic training device on chronic stroke subjects: Task training system for stroke rehabilitation","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1006HoAnEMGDrivenExoskeletonHandRoboticTraini.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074063S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5961155","isNumber":"5975334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5961155","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"5975334","articleId":"5975340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5975346,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian O.

It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; <; 0.8\u00b0 static RMS error, <; 1.7\u00b0 dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975346","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5961155/5975334/05975346.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of IMU and MARG orientation using a gradient descent algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of IMU and MARG orientation using a gradient descent algorithm","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975346/","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12178958","pubMedId":"22275550","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975346/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of IMU and MARG orientation using a gradient descent algorithm","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1011MadgwickEstimationofIMUandMARGorientation.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070207S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5961155","isNumber":"5975334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5961155","citationCount":"863","xplore-issue":"5975334","articleId":"5975346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5975468,"authors":[{"name":"Peter D Neuhaus","affiliation":["Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), Pensacola, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Peter D","lastName":"Neuhaus","id":"37283043600"},{"name":"Jerryll H Noorden","affiliation":["Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), Pensacola, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jerryll H","lastName":"Noorden","id":"37572129900"},{"name":"Travis J Craig","affiliation":["Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), Pensacola, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Travis J","lastName":"Craig","id":"37583374000"},{"name":"Tecalote Torres","affiliation":["Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), Pensacola, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Tecalote","lastName":"Torres","id":"37948408000"},{"name":"Justin Kirschbaum","affiliation":["Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), Pensacola, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Kirschbaum","id":"37946364800"},{"name":"Jerry E Pratt","affiliation":["Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), Pensacola, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jerry E","lastName":"Pratt","id":"37283041800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9862-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9863-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9861-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-7901"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7898"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1945-7898"}],"articleNumber":"5975468","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2167},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and evaluation of Mina: A robotic orthosis for paraplegics","abstract":"Mobility options for persons suffering from paraplegia or paraparesis are limited to mainly wheeled devices.

We present the Mina, a robotic orthosis for assisting mobility, which offers a legged mobility option for these persons. Mina is an overground robotic device that is worn on the back and around the legs to provide mobility assistance for people suffering from paraplegia or paraparesis. Mina uses compliant actuation to power the hip and knee joints. For paralyzed users, balance is provided with the assistance of forearm crutches. This paper presents the evaluation of Mina with two paraplegics (SCI ASIA-A). We confirmed that with a few hours of training and practice, Mina is currently able to provide paraplegics walking mobility at speeds of up to 0.20 m/s. We further confirmed that using Mina is not physically taxing and requires little cognitive effort, allowing the user to converse and maintain eye contact while walking.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975468","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975334","pdfPath":"/iel5/5961155/5975334/05975468.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Actuators","Legged locomotion","Leg","Computers","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","eye","gait analysis","medical robotics","orthotics","prosthetics","training","vision","wheelchairs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["paraplegia","paraparesis","wheeled devices","wheelchair","Mina","robotic orthosis","legged mobility","overground robotic device","mobility assistance","hip joints","knee joints","paralyzed users","forearm crutches","walking mobility","eye contact"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Powered Orthosis","Exoskeleton","Paraplegic","Gait generation","Locomotion","Orthoses","Robotics","Mobility device"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Female","Gait","Humans","Male","Movement","Orthotic Devices","Robotics","Robotics","Self-Help Devices","Spinal Cord Injuries","Walking","Young Adult"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of Mina: A robotic orthosis for paraplegics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975468/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975468/","accessionNumber":"12173030","isStaticHtml":true,"pubMedId":"22275666","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of Mina: A robotic orthosis for paraplegics","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1130NeuhausDesignandEvaluationofMinaaRoboticO.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051192S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5961155","isNumber":"5975334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5961155","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5975334","articleId":"5975468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5975475,"authors":[{"name":"Brian E.

An anthropomorphically inspired agonist-antagonist impedance controller studied in a myoelectric elbow prosthesis is adapted for the knee joint. To parameterize the controller, regression analysis was applied to a recently updated lower-extremity neuromuscular simulation model that provides estimates of knee torque as a function of knee angle and neural activation. Initial results using a constant moment arm suggest physically unreasonable parameters and poor model performance, but the inclusion of an angle-dependent moment arm in the reduced-order muscle model enables good correlation with the high-order neuromuscular model. The resulting limb controller is tested using a 1-DOF active knee prosthesis donned by a non-amputee subject with an able-bodied adapter. Initial treadmill walking tests demonstrate the potential of this controller to enable effective myoelectric control of the prosthetic limb.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975480","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5961155/5975334/05975480.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A configuration dependent muscle model for the myoelectric control of a transfemoral prosthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975480/","displayDocTitle":"A configuration dependent muscle model for the myoelectric control of a transfemoral prosthesis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173037","pubMedId":"22275678","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975480/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A configuration dependent muscle model for the myoelectric control of a transfemoral prosthesis","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1142HooverAConfigurationDependentMuscleModelf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075045S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5961155","isNumber":"5975334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5961155","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5975334","articleId":"5975480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5975486,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Ron-Angevin","affiliation":["Departmento Tecnolog\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica, E.T.S.I.

Four healthy subjects participated in the experiment.

Gait pattern planning is important, in order to ensure the gait patterns induced by robotic systems on the patient are natural and smooth. It is known that the gait parameters (stride length, cadence) are the key factors, which affect gait pattern. However, a systematic methodology for gait pattern planning is missing. Therefore, a gait pattern generation methodology, GaitGen, was proposed in our previous work. In this paper, we introduce a new model to enhance the proposed methodology for generating the joint angle waveforms of the lower limb during walking, with the gait parameters and the lower limb anthropometric data as input. The walking motion was captured with a motion capture system using passive markers. The waveforms of lower limb joint angles were calculated from the experimental data and the waveforms were then decomposed into Fourier coefficients. Therefore, each joint angle waveform can be represented by a Fourier coefficient vector containing eleven elements to facilitate the waveform analysis. Multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNNs) were designed to predict the Fourier coefficient vectors for specific subject and desired gait parameters. Assessment parameters such as correlation coefficient, mean absolute deviation (MAD) and threshold absolute deviation (TAD) were calculated to examine the quality of MLPNNs' prediction. The constructed waveforms from predicted Fourier coefficient vectors were compared with the actual waveforms calculated from experimental data by using the above-mentioned assessment parameters. The results show that the constructed waveforms closely match the experimental waveforms based on the assessment parameter outcomes.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975491","pdfPath":"/iel5/5961155/5975334/05975491.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subject-specific lower limb waveforms planning via artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Subject-specific lower limb waveforms planning via artificial neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12189364","pubMedId":"22275688","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5975491/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subject-specific lower limb waveforms planning via artificial neural network","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1152TrieuPhatSubjectSpecificLowerLimbWaveform.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055908S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5961155","isNumber":"5975334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5961155","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5975334","articleId":"5975491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5975499,"authors":[{"name":"Kyle N.

In this paper, Speeded up Robust Features (SURF), a scale and rotation invariant interesting point descriptor, is further explored for face recognition. Specially, a novel technique, Cell Similarity is proposed to make improvement based on SURF in face recognition. In the meantime, different cell division strategies are proposed and evaluated in this paper, which move towards revealing the inner relation and essence in face recognition. We not only obtain good results in ORL dataset and our Lab dataset (aligned face), but also speed up the original version by reducing matching time. Moreover, in order to further deal with rotation situation, another new loopy Cell Similarity method in these two datasets is evaluated, and advantages and disadvantages of different implementations are also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959905/5975538/05975572.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"169","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast SURF way for human face recognition with Cell Similarity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Face","Accuracy","Robustness","Humans","Conferences","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human face recognition","computer vision","speeded up robust features","cell division strategy","matching time reduction","loopy cell similarity method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","loopy Cell Similarity","SURF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A fast SURF way for human face recognition with Cell Similarity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975572/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12170188","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast SURF way for human face recognition with Cell Similarity","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"rp034P1034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094651S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959905","isNumber":"5975538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959905","xplore-issue":"5975538","articleId":"5975572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5975576,"authors":[{"name":"Shiqi Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Shiqi","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37903029400"},{"name":"Zhihang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Zhihang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37335573100"},{"name":"M.

The approach uses the exponential smoothing method to pre-process traffic flow data before implementing on neural networks for training purpose. The pre-processed traffic flow data, which is lesser non-smooth, discontinuous and lumpy than the original traffic flow data, is more suitable to use for neural network training. This neural network development approach was evaluated by forecasting real-time traffic conditions on a section of the freeway in Western Australia. Regarding training errors which indicate capability in fitting traffic flow data, the neural network models developed by the proposed approach was capable to achieve more than 20% of the rate of improvement relative to the neural network developed based on the original traffic flow data. Regarding testing errors which indicate generalization capability for traffic flow forecasting, the neural network models developed by the proposed approach was capable in achieving more than 8% of the rate of improvement relative to the neural networks developed based on the original traffic flow data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975612/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12170228","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975612/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Traffic flow forecasting neural networks based on exponential smoothing method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic flow forecasting neural networks based on exponential smoothing method","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"rp074P0214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060129S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959905","isNumber":"5975538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959905","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5975538","articleId":"5975612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5975617,"authors":[{"name":"Yann-Chang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cheng Shiu University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yann-Chang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37278784500"},{"name":"Shin-Ju Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shin-Ju","lastName":"Chen","id":"37961195500"},{"name":"Chao-Ming Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Ming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281275100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8756-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8754-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"}],"articleNumber":"5975617","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radial basis function networks","Training data","Artificial neural networks","Optimization","Training","Convergence","Circuit breakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","evolutionary computation","fuzzy reasoning","power engineering computing","power system restoration","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal radial basic function neural network","distribution system restoration","optimal RBF neural network","service restoration","enhanced differential evolution algorithm","EDE algorithm","training data creation phase","network construction phase","heuristic-based fuzzy inference method","HBFI method","Taiwan power company","TPC","forecasting accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radial basic function","differential evolution","service restoration","distribution engineering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975617","abstract":"This paper presents an optimal radial basic function (RBF) neural network for fast restoration of distribution systems under different load levels. Basically, service restoration of distribution systems is a stressful and urgent task that must be performed by system operators. In this paper, a RBF network evolved by an enhanced differential evolution (EDE) algorithm is developed to achieve the fast restoration of distribution systems. The proposed scheme comprises training data creation phase and network construction phase. In the training data creation phase, a heuristic-based fuzzy inference (HBFI) method is employed to build the restoration plans under various load levels. Then an optimal RBF network is constructed by the EDE algorithm in the network construction phase. Once the RBF network is constructed properly, the desired restoration plan can be produced as soon as the inputs are given. The proposed method has been verified on a typical distribution system of the Taiwan Power Company (TPC). Results show the proposed method can provide better convergence performance and forecasting accuracy than the existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975617","startPage":"401","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975538","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959905/5975538/05975617.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving radial basic function neural network for fast restoration of distribution systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975617/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolving radial basic function neural network for fast restoration of distribution systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975617/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12170233","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving radial basic function neural network for fast restoration of distribution systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"rp079P0143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06735S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959905","isNumber":"5975538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959905","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5975538","articleId":"5975617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5975620,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyue Meng","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenyue","lastName":"Meng","id":"37954743700"},{"name":"Chen Wei","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wei","id":"38183204900"},{"name":"Jie Tang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Tang","id":"37960226200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8756-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8754-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"}],"articleNumber":"5975620","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975620","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Aerospace control","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Stability criteria","Aircraft","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cultural algorithm","particle swarm optimization","flight control law clearance","longitudinal flight control system","parametric model uncertainties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Cultural Algorithm","clearance","worst combine of parameters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975620","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959905/5975538/05975620.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","startPage":"418","endPage":"423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cultural algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization for clearance of flight control law","abstract":"A multiple optimization algorithm, the Cultural Algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (CAPSO) was applied to flight control law clearance.

The goal is to achieve size reduction of an existing circuitry inside the probe, that consists of two microcontrollers and a reconfigurable hardware device such as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), that implements some custom functions. In order to reduce the printed circuit board (PCB) area occupied by these three chips and the associated routing area, we combine them on a single SoPC.

Although the technology has been existed for a long time, never before has it has received the current level of attention. This can be primarily attributed to social demand related to the increased use of mobile devices, which need frequent recharging, and plugging the device into an outlet is not convenient. It is also due to changes in available technology. The emergence of electromagnetic resonant coupling, which works over a large air gap with high efficiency has until recently not been possible with typical technologies. However, there are limitations to using only a transmitting and a receiving antenna. Repeater antennas have been proposed to extend the length of the air gap. Long distance power transfer is achieved by simply installing a repeater between the transmitting and receiving stations. And by installing repeaters inside walls, below desks, and under the floor, it will be possible to realize a fully wireless house in which it is possible to charge devices anywhere inside its confines. Previous studies have demonstrated that a repeater antenna can extend the distance of the power transfer with the installation of a repeater antenna between a transmitting antenna and a receiving antenna. Detailed studies of mutual inductance, the position of repeater antennas and theoretical studies about equivalent circuits cannot be found in the literature. This paper proposes that theoretical study of equivalent circuits of repeater antennas it includes the problem of sign of mutual inductance which is occurred when the repeater antennas are used.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975538","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1506","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959905/5975538/05975828.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalent circuit for repeater antenna for wireless power transfer via magnetic resonant coupling considering signed coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5975828/","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent circuit for repeater antenna for wireless power transfer via magnetic resonant coupling considering signed coupling","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12170443","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent circuit for repeater antenna for wireless power transfer via magnetic resonant coupling considering signed coupling","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"rp289P0911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061719S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959905","isNumber":"5975538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959905","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5975538","articleId":"5975828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5975839,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Jihua","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Jihua","id":"37541637900"},{"name":"Sun Jinping","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Jinping","id":"37396353900"},{"name":"Han Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37955039500"},{"name":"Zhang Bingchen","affiliation":["Nat.

The experimental results show that the system can capture images at the rate of 25 frames/s when the frame size of CMOS digital camera is set to 1280*1024 pixels, which can meet the real-time image processing system requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975870","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959905/5975538/05975870.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975538","startPage":"1726","endPage":"1730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of CMOS image acquisition system based on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of CMOS image acquisition system based on FPGA","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975870/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12170485","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5975870/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of CMOS image acquisition system based on FPGA","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"rp331P0847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047692S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959905","isNumber":"5975538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959905","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5975538","articleId":"5975870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5975874,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanfeng Lian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanfeng","lastName":"Lian","id":"37086555609"},{"name":"Falin Wu","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-electronic Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Falin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37851786400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8756-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8754-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"}],"articleNumber":"5975874","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975874","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Level set","Biological neural networks","Probabilistic logic","Training","Genetic algorithms","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive probabilistic neural network","level set method","MR image segmentation","brain segmentation","magnetic resonance imaging","level set evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Probabilistic Neural Network","Level Set","MR Image","Curve Propagation","Segmentation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975874","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959905/5975538/05975874.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating adaptive probabilistic neural network with level set methods for MR image segmentation","abstract":"This paper presents a new approach based on adaptive probabilistic neural network (APNN) and level set method for brain segmentation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The zero-voltage switching technique is employed to implement the double-voltage-fed CCFL drive circuit of Class-D isolated resonant inverter to improve the conversion efficiency. By utilizing burst mode dimming technique to regulate light output, the CCFL output voltage was intermittently outputted and the required dimming functions can be achieved.

In this paper, a new ensemble learning algorithm for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery is proposed, which integrates feature grouping and anomalous signal subspace estimation. Main contribution of the proposed algorithm consists in two aspects. First, feature grouping in original hyperspectral images are firstly performed to form feature subsets with more diversity. In the subsets, conventional RX detector can better learn its model parameters. Second, an iterative orthogonal projection processing is given to estimate rare signal subspace for anomalous targets in each feature subset so as to more effectively remove background clutters. Finally, the RX detection is carried out with the estimated signal subspace in the subsets, and the detection results are combined by majority voting. Numerical experiments are conducted on real hyperspectral images and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975970","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959905/5975538/05975970.pdf","startPage":"2274","endPage":"2277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5975970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A feature-clustering-based subspace ensemble method for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagety","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5975970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5975970/","displayDocTitle":"A feature-clustering-based subspace ensemble method for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagety","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12170585","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5975970/","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A feature-clustering-based subspace ensemble method for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagety","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"rp431P0812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150271S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959905","isNumber":"5975538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959905","xplore-issue":"5975538","articleId":"5975970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5976006,"authors":[{"name":"Maw-Yang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National I-Lan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Maw-Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37534371700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8756-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8754-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"}],"articleNumber":"5976006","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Encoding","Adaptive optics","Multiaccess communication","Optical fibers","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","correlation methods","interference (signal)","optical communication","runlength codes","shot noise","thermal noise","trellis codes","wavelength assignment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis RLL code","coset representative","two-dimensional run-length limited code","time-spreading wavelength-hopping optical CDMA systems","carrier-hopping prime code","signature sequences","symmetric code","phase autocorrelation","cross-correlation","zero autocorrelation sidelobes property","two-dimensional ternary symbols","trellis run-length limited code","codeword","multiple access interference","beat noise","detrimental factors","system impairment","deteriorating impacts","system performance","thermal noise","shot noise","relative intensity noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-D Optical CDMA","carrier hopping prime code","coset representative"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the employment of two-dimensional run-length limited code is investigated for time-spreading wavelength-hopping optical CDMA systems.

Then, the adaptive FNN control system is proposed to control the rotor of the PMSM servo drive for the tracking of periodic reference inputs. In the adaptive FNN control system, the FNN controller is used to mimic an optimal control law, and the compensated controller with adaptive algorithm is proposed to compensate the difference between the optimal control law and the FNN controller. Moreover, an on-line parameter training methodology, which is derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem and the backpropagation method, is proposed to increase the learning capability of the FNN. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes is verified by experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5976016","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959905/5975538/05976016.pdf","startPage":"2518","endPage":"2523","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2011.5976016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fuzzy neural network control with adaptive algorithm for a PM synchronous motor drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"The fuzzy neural network control with adaptive algorithm for a PM synchronous motor drive","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12170631","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5976016/","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fuzzy neural network control with adaptive algorithm for a PM synchronous motor drive","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"rp477P0120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04933S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959905","isNumber":"5975538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5975538","articleId":"5976016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5976017,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihong Man","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Industrial Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhihong","lastName":"Man","id":"37339463300"},{"name":"Kevin Lee","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Industrial Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37966723100"},{"name":"Dianhui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, La Trobe University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Dianhui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292146500"},{"name":"Zhenwei Cao","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Industrial Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhenwei","lastName":"Cao","id":"37418757000"},{"name":"Chunyan Miao","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chunyan","lastName":"Miao","id":"37272697500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8756-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8754-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8755-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"}],"articleNumber":"5976017","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Signal to noise ratio","Robustness","Biological neural networks","Machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified ELM algorithm","single-hidden layer feedforward neural network","linear nodes","input disturbance effect removal","structural risk reduction","empirical risk reduction","output weight","output error minimization","SLFN-based classifier","extreme learning machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pre-processor","extreme learning machine","neural networks","signal classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976017","abstract":"A modified ELM algorithm for a class of single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) with linear nodes is discussed in this paper.

But designing cloud infrastructure in term for securing the data is one of the most concerns that enterprise worries about it. Cost reduction and providing the features as per the demand are the main operation of cloud computing. There are two main components that the cloud systems require, they are scalable infrastructure and scalable data platform. In this paper, we propose a private cloud, one among the suitable cloud environments for e-government data center, with a modeling of the cloud computing based upon the Eucalyptus architecture. To understand the behavior of Eucalyptus, we consider Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) as reference architecture for our Cloud Test bed environment in our Lab. With UEC architecture, we address the availability of each component of the cloud base on Markov chain through the level analysis of hierarchical available model (HAM).","doi":"10.1109/IMIS.2011.135","publicationTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975322/5976142/05976174.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMIS.2011.135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5976142","startPage":"289","endPage":"296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Cloud Computing Availability Based on Eucalyptus Platform for E-Government Data Center","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Cloud Computing Availability Based on Eucalyptus Platform for E-Government Data Center","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976174/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12172051","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5976174/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Cloud Computing Availability Based on Eucalyptus Platform for E-Government Data Center","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4372a289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.663454S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975322","isNumber":"5976142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975322","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5976142","articleId":"5976174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5976179,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Hirth","affiliation":["University of W\u00fcrzburg, Institute of Computer Science, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Hirth","id":"37856013400"},{"name":"Tobias Ho\u00dffeld","affiliation":["University of W\u00fcrzburg, Institute of Computer Science, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Ho\u00dffeld","id":"37300022400"},{"name":"Phuoc Tran-Gia","affiliation":["University of W\u00fcrzburg, Institute of Computer Science, Germany"],"firstName":"Phuoc","lastName":"Tran-Gia","id":"38272340900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-733-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4372-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5976179","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1300},"abstract":"Since Jeff Howe introduced the term \"crowdsourcing\" in 2006 for the first time, crowd sourcing has be come a growing market in the current Internet.

It provides the entire game experience to the users remotely from a data center. The player is no longer dependent on a specific type or quality of gaming hardware, but is able to use common devices. The end device only needs a broadband internet connection and the ability to display High Definition (HD) video. While this may reduce hardware costs for users and increase the revenue for developers by leaving out the retail chain, it also raises new challenges for service quality in terms of bandwidth and latency for the underlying network. In this paper we present the results of a subjective user study we conducted into the user-perceived quality of experience (QoE) in Cloud Gaming.

Avoiding the power conversion loss, AC LED can have lower energy consumption and higher luminous efficiency than DC LED does. Because of high brightness, low power consumption and long lifetime, LED has been used as a lighting device and is expected to replace the high power-consuming incandescent and fluorescent lamps in the 21th century, in consequence the white light AC LED is a better choice for general illumination in the future. In this study, a white light AC LED smart lighting system equipped with visible light time-division multiplexing optical communication for free space is proposed. In the system, the timing to transmit data is synchronized with the period of the AC power on the wall, in order to keep the transmitted optical signal in an enough level. As a result, the time-division multiplexing optical communication by AC LED lighting is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/IMIS.2011.66","publicationTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975322/5976142/05976279.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMIS.2011.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5976142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An AC LED Smart Lighting System with Visible Light Time-Division Multiplexing Free Space Optical Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976279/","displayDocTitle":"An AC LED Smart Lighting System with Visible Light Time-Division Multiplexing Free Space Optical Communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12172117","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5976279/","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An AC LED Smart Lighting System with Visible Light Time-Division Multiplexing Free Space Optical Communication","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4372a589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043733S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975322","isNumber":"5976142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975322","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5976142","articleId":"5976279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5976367,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Richter","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Thomas Richter (S\u201909) received the Dipl.-Ing.

The investigations are done in a polarization-dependent (straight) as well as in a polarization-independent (loop) configuration using single- and dual-polarization DQPSK. Particular attention is paid to the resulting optical signal-to-noise ratio penalties after the amplification. We ascribe this to pump-induced nonlinear phase noise. It is shown that this type of excess noise is increased for the loop configuration in comparison with the straight configuration due to Rayleigh backscattering and that it depends on the input polarization of the signal.

Occupying about the same substrate area as a conventional antenna, the proposed structure not only serves as a radiator but also a second-order bandpass filter, with one filter pole provided by a \u0393-shaped antenna and the other by a newly proposed coupled line resonator. High band-edge selectivity is achieved due to two additional stop-band transmission zeros provided by the coupled line resonator. To minimize the required area and reduce the spurious radiation, a coupled line structure composed of a microstrip line and a coplanar waveguide by broadside coupling is adopted and intruded into the \u0393-shaped antenna area. According to the filter specifications, a design procedure for the proposed filtering antenna is depicted in detail. One example at 2.45 GHz with a second-order Chebyshev bandpass filter of 0.1 dB equal-ripple response is tackled. As compared to the conventional \u0393 -shaped antenna, the proposed filtering antenna not only possesses a similar antenna gain but also provides better band-edge gain selectivity and flat passband gain response. The measured results, including the S-parameters, total radiated power, and antenna gains versus frequency, have good agreement with the designed ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact Printed Filtering Antenna Using a Ground-Intruded Coupled Line Resonator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2163777","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6033668/05976380.pdf","startPage":"3630","endPage":"3637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2163777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6033668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976380/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Printed Filtering Antenna Using a Ground-Intruded Coupled Line Resonator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5976380/","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270620","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact Printed Filtering Antenna Using a Ground-Intruded Coupled Line Resonator","sourcePdf":"tap-chung-2163777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077053S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6033668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6033668","articleId":"5976380","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5976381,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Costa","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy","Department of Radio Science and Engineering/ SMARAD CoE, School of Science and Technology, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6033668/5976381/5976381-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Filippo Costa (S'07\u2013M'10) was born in Pisa, Italy, on October 31, 1980.

The emphasis of this paper is on the additional resonances of the radiating structure caused by surface waves propagating on the high-impedance surface. It is shown that such resonances can be favorably used for broadening the bandwidth of the antenna. The phenomenon is thoroughly modeled by exploiting a parallel between the HIS structure and a waveguide resonator. In the second part of the paper we discuss homogenized approaches for modeling the radiating properties of the antenna with emphasis to the phenomenon discussed in the first part. As it turns out, it is necessary to take into account the spatially dispersive properties of high-impedance surfaces, and most of the simplified models commonly used for analyzing high-impedance surface based antennas fail in predicting the discussed resonance mode.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6033668/05976381.pdf","startPage":"3588","endPage":"3596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2163750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2163750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6033668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TE Surface Wave Resonances on High-Impedance Surface Based Antennas: Analysis and Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface impedance","Surface waves","Impedance","Dispersion","Dipole antennas","Approximation methods","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","dipole antennas","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TE surface wave resonances","high-impedance surface-based antennas","low-profile antennas","horizontal dipole","radiating structure","surface wave propagation","antenna bandwidth","HIS structure","waveguide resonator","antenna radiating property modeling","spatially-dispersive properties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial magnetic conductor (AMC)","electromagnetic bandgap (EBG)","frequency selective surfaces (FSS)","high impedance surfaces (HIS)","metamaterials"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"TE Surface Wave Resonances on High-Impedance Surface Based Antennas: Analysis and Modeling","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5976381/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270621","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TE Surface Wave Resonances on High-Impedance Surface Based Antennas: Analysis and Modeling","sourcePdf":"tap-costa-2163750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081818S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6033668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6033668","articleId":"5976381","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5976394,"authors":[{"name":"Duixian Liu","affiliation":["IBM T.

First, free space analysis allows the choice of the antenna typology with reduced computation time. Subsequently the antenna, inserted in a body phantom, is designed to take into account all the necessary electronic components, power supply and bio-compatible insulation so as to realize a complete implantable device. The conformal design has suitable dimensions for subcutaneous implantation (10 \u00d7 32.1 mm). The effect of different body phantoms is discussed. The radiator works in both the Medical Device Radiocommunication Service (MedRadio, 401-406 MHz) and the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM, 2.4-2.5 GHz) bands. Simulated maximum gains attain -28.8 and - 18.5 dBi in the two desired frequency ranges, respectively, when the radiator is implanted subcutaneously in a homogenous cylindrical body phantom (80 \u00d7 110 mm) with muscle equivalent dielectric properties. Three antennas are realized and characterized in order to improve simulation calibration, electromagnetic performance, and to validate the repeatability of the manufacturing process. Measurements are also presented and a good correspondence with theoretical predictions is registered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","volume":"59","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12270638","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5976398/","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design, Realization and Measurements of a Miniature Antenna for Implantable Wireless Communication Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Realization and Measurements of a Miniature Antenna for Implantable Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-merli-2163763-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09181S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6033668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6033668","articleId":"5976398","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5976404,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Lucia Scarpello","affiliation":["Electromagnetics Group, Department of Information Technology, INTEC, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6033668/5976404/5976404-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maria Lucia Scarpello was born in 1983.

These attacks work by compromising direct load control command signals, demand side management price signals, or cloud computation load distribution algorithms to affect the load at the most crucial locations in the grid in order to cause circuit overflow or other malfunctions and damage the power system equipment. To gain insights into these less-examined yet important intrusion strategies, in this paper, we identify a variety of practical loads that can be volnurable to Internet-based load altering attacks. In addition, we overview a collection of defense mechanisms that can help in blocking these attacks or minimizing the damage caused by them. Our simulation results based on the standard setting in the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System show that our proposed cost-efficent load protection strategy can significantly reduce the cost of load protection while it guarantees that no Internet-based load altering attack may overload the power distribution system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","volume":"2","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12376604","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5976424/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Internet-Based Load Altering Attacks Against Smart Power Grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Internet-Based Load Altering Attacks Against Smart Power Grids","sourcePdf":"tsg-mohsenianrad-2160297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097463S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6084801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"6084801","articleId":"5976424","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":5976425,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A 3-GHz Type-I \u03a3\u0394 fractional-N PLL with an exponentially settling voltage-mode switched-RC phase frequency detector (PFD) is presented. A voltage-mode, fully settled switched-RC (SRC)-based sample-and-hold PFD, providing benefits of both an RC loop-filter and a zero-order hold sinc( ) suppressing reference clock leakage is presented. The exponentially settled SRC PFD is shown to reduce the in-band leakage of quantization noise by 13 dB in comparison to a similar current-mode charge pump PFD, enabling a measured loop-bandwidth of 890-kHz. The fractional-N PLL is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS technology with 6 metal layers and consumes 18-mA from a 1.8-V power supply. The worst-case near-integer in-band spur is measured at -62 dBc. The measured in-band phase noise at 100-kHz offset from the 3-GHz carrier is -107 dBc/Hz and out-of-band phase noise at 3-MHz offset is -130 dBc/Hz.

Amplitude-to-amplitude (AM-AM) and amplitude-to-phase (AM-PM) distortions are two significant distortion effects in PAs at high output power levels, causing out of band interference in the transmitted signal and bit errors in the received signal. Traditional measurements of amplitude and phase distortion in RF PAs require the use of expensive vector network analyzers. In this work, we propose the use of phase-to-amplitude conversion to develop a low cost and accurate test methodology for AM-AM and AM-PM measurement using simple load board test circuitry along with software based difference generation and peak detection mechanisms. Using either simple sine wave stimulus with power sweep or a single amplitude modulated RF stimulus, both distortion effects can be measured with high accuracy for nominal devices as well as over process and voltage variations, while allowing significant reduction in test cost.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2160376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2160376","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1614","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6236332/05976427.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6236332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Distortion to Amplitude Conversion-Based Low-Cost Measurement of AM-AM and AM-PM Effects in RF Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Phase Distortion to Amplitude Conversion-Based Low-Cost Measurement of AM-AM and AM-PM Effects in RF Power Amplifiers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2012","volume":"20","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5976427/","accessionNumber":"12853116","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976427/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Distortion to Amplitude Conversion-Based Low-Cost Measurement of AM-AM and AM-PM Effects in RF Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-sen-2160376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077964S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6236332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6236332","articleId":"5976427","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5976431,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Wartzek","affiliation":["Chair of Medical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6047315/5976431/5976431-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tobias Wartzek was born in Krefeld in 1982.

This feasibility study investigated unobtrusive capacitive ECG measurements in an automotive environment. Electrodes integrated into the driving seat allowed to measure a reliable ECG in 86% of the drivers; when only (light) cotton clothing was worn by the drivers, this value increased to 95%. Results show that an array of sensors is needed that can adapt to the different drivers and sitting positions. Measurements while driving show that traveling on the highway does not distort the signal any more than with the car engine turned OFF, whereas driving in city traffic results in a lowered detection rate due to the driver's heavier movements. To enable robust and reliable estimation of heart rate, an algorithm is presented (based on principal component analysis) to detect and discard time intervals with artifacts. This, then, allows a reliable estimation of heart rate of up to 61% in city traffic and up to 86% on the highway: as a percentage of the total driving period with at least four consecutive QRS complexes.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2163715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6047315/05976431.pdf","startPage":"3112","endPage":"3120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2163715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG on the Road: Robust and Unobtrusive Estimation of Heart Rate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976431/","displayDocTitle":"ECG on the Road: Robust and Unobtrusive Estimation of Heart Rate","volume":"58","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291058","pubMedId":"21824839","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5976431/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG on the Road: Robust and Unobtrusive Estimation of Heart Rate","sourcePdf":"tbme-wartzek-2163715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125727S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6047315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6047315","articleId":"5976431","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5976437,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoxia Liu","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6133465/5976437/5976437-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["ZhaoXia Liu was born in Shandong, China, in 1982.

In this paper, a simple and robust feature point matching algorithm, called Restricted Spatial Order Constraints (RSOC), is proposed to remove outliers for registering aerial images with monotonous backgrounds, similar patterns, low overlapping areas, and large affine transformation. In RSOC, both local structure and global information are considered. Based on adjacent spatial order, an affine invariant descriptor is defined, and point matching is formulated as an optimization problem. A graph matching method is used to solve it and yields two matched graphs with a minimum global transformation error. In order to eliminate dubious matches, a filtering strategy is designed. The strategy integrates two-way spatial order constraints and two decision criteria restrictions, i.e., the stability and accuracy of transformation error. Twenty-nine pairs of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) aerial images are utilized to evaluate the performance. Compared with RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC), Graph Transformation Matching (GTM), and Spatial Order Constraints (SOC), RSOC obtained the highest precision and stability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple and Robust Feature Point Matching Algorithm Based on Restricted Spatial Order Constraints for Aerial Image Registration","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2160645","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6133465/05976437.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2160645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Simple and Robust Feature Point Matching Algorithm Based on Restricted Spatial Order Constraints for Aerial Image Registration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5976437/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12477839","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple and Robust Feature Point Matching Algorithm Based on Restricted Spatial Order Constraints for Aerial Image Registration","sourcePdf":"tgrs-an-2160645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119452S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6133465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6133465","articleId":"5976437","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5976438,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Bonafoni","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5997355/5976438/5976438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefania Bonafoni was born in Fabriano, Italy, on March 9, 1971.

An information-theoretic formulation of the problem is presented. A coding scheme that combines rate splitting, superposition coding, nested binning, and channel prefixing is considered and is shown to achieve the secrecy capacity region of the channel in several scenarios. Specifying these results to both scalar and independent parallel Gaussian channels (under an average individual per-subchannel power constraint), it is shown that the high-security message can be embedded into the low-security message at full rate (as if the low-security message does not exist) without incurring any loss on the overall rate of communication (as if both messages are low-security messages). Extensions to the wiretap channel II setting of Ozarow and Wyner are also considered, where it is shown that \"perfect\" security embedding can be achieved by an encoder that uses a two-level coset code.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6126191/05976444.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2163713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2163713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Embedding Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Receivers","Markov processes","Encoding","Transmitters","Noise measurement","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","information theory","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security embedding codes","high-security message","low-security message","legitimate receiver","security embedding problem","information-theoretic formulation","rate splitting","superposition coding","nested binning","channel prefixing","secrecy capacity region","independent parallel Gaussian channels","encoder","two-level coset code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel uncertainty","multilevel security","physical-layer security","secrecy capacity","security embedding","wiretap channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Security Embedding Codes","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5976444/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471615","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Embedding Codes","sourcePdf":"tifs-ly-2163713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10478S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6126191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6126191","articleId":"5976444","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5976445,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Deng","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6119253/5976445/5976445-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Deng received the B.S. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1994 and the M.S. degree in 1997 from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in measuring and testing technology and instruments in the School of Automation Engineering.","His research is focused on the diagnosis of complicated electronic systems."]},"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","id":"38107362400"},{"name":"Yibing Shi","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6119253/5976445/5976445-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yibing Shi received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 1985, 1988, and 2002, respectively.","Since 1988, he has been with UESTC and is currently a Professor with the School of Automation Engineering.

Our approach is inspired by the control scheme that humans employ for such actions, which is known to centrally depend on tactile sensation rather than vision or proprioception. Our controller processes measurements from the gripper's fingertip pressure arrays and hand-mounted accelerometer in real time to generate robotic tactile signals that are designed to mimic human SA-I, FA-I, and FA-II channels. These signals are combined into tactile event cues that drive the transitions between six discrete states in the grasp controller: Close, Load, Lift and Hold, Replace, Unload, and Open. The controller selects an appropriate initial grasping force, detects when an object is slipping from the grasp, increases the grasp force as needed, and judges when to release an object to set it down. We demonstrate the promise of our approach through implementation on the PR2 robotic platform, including grasp testing on a large number of real-world objects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6094076/05976472.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2162271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2162271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6094076","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-Inspired Robotic Grasp Control With Tactile Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Tactile sensors","Grippers","Grasping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","grippers","humanoid robots","mechanoception","mobile robots","motion control","pressure control","robot vision","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-inspired robotic grasp control","tactile sensing","sensorized parallel jaw gripper","proprioception","gripper fingertip pressure array","hand-mounted accelerometer","robotic tactile signal","SA-I channel","FA-I channel","FA-II channel","tactile event cue","grasp force","PR2 robotic platform","grasp testing","real-world object"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robot grasping","tactile sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Human-Inspired Robotic Grasp Control With Tactile Sensing","volume":"27","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5976472/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12403984","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-Inspired Robotic Grasp Control With Tactile Sensing","sourcePdf":"tro-romano-2162271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090525S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6094076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"245","xplore-issue":"6094076","articleId":"5976472","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5976475,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/6129833/5976475/5976475-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Wang (M'08) was born in Hubei, China, in 1980.

Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2160394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6006807/05976476.pdf","startPage":"1715","endPage":"1724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2160394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Primal\u2013Dual Subgradient Method for Multiagent Optimization via Consensus Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Primal\u2013Dual Subgradient Method for Multiagent Optimization via Consensus Algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976476/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12359993","pubMedId":"21824853","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5976476/","volume":"41","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Primal\u2013Dual Subgradient Method for Multiagent Optimization via Consensus Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-xu-2160394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109259S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6006807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6006807","articleId":"5976476","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5976477,"authors":[{"name":"Sigal Berman","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management and Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/6182956/5976477/5976477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sigal Berman (M'91) received the B.

With the impending movement toward natural communication with mechanical and software systems, it is important to examine the first apparatus that separates the human communicator and the device being controlled. Although there are numerous reviews of GRSs, a comprehensive analysis of the integration of sensors into GRSs and their impact on system performance is lacking in the professional literature. Thus, we have undertaken this effort. Determination of the sensor stimulus, context of use, and sensor platform are major preliminary design issues in GRSs. Thus, these three components form the basic structure of our taxonomy. We emphasize the relationship between these critical components and the design of the GRS in terms of its architectural functions and computational requirements. In this treatise, we consider sensors that are capable of capturing dynamic and static arm and hand gestures. Although we discuss various sensor types, our main focus is on visual sensors as we expect these to become the sensor of choice in the foreseeable future. We delineate the challenges ahead for their increased effectiveness in this application domain. We note as a special challenge, the development of sensors that take over many of the functions the GRS designer struggles with today. We believe our contribution, in this first survey on sensors for GRSs, can give valuable insights into this important research and development topic, and encourage advanced research directions and new approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161077","startPage":"277","endPage":"290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/6182956/05976477.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6182956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensors for Gesture Recognition Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sensors for Gesture Recognition Systems","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12673640","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5976477/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensors for Gesture Recognition Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-berman-2161077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205252S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"6182956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6182956","articleId":"5976477","onlineDate":"04 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5976506,"authors":[{"name":"Entisar E.

The network traffic data was collected using WireShark for three days, using the six most common network attributes. The experiment used three association rule data mining techniques known as Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori and FP-Growth based on two, five and ten second window slicing. Out of the four data-sets, data-sets one and two were detected to have anomalies. The results show that the Fuzzy Appriori algorithm presented the best quality result, while FP-Growth presented a faster time to reach a solution. The data-sets, which was pre-processed in the form of two second window slicing displayed better results.

Among power disturbances, voltage sags are considered as the most frequent type of disturbances in the field and their impact on sensitive loads is severe. However, to assess voltage sags, installation of power quality monitors (PQM) at all system buses is not economical. Thus, this study is carried out to develop a power quality monitor positioning algorithm to find the optimal number and placement of PQMs in both transmission and distribution systems. In this approach, first, the concept of topological monitor reach area is introduced. Then the binary particle swarm optimization hybridized with artificial immune system is used to solve multi-objective function in finding the optimal placement of PQMs. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and tested on the IEEE 30-bus and the 69-bus test systems to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for both transmission and distribution systems.","doi":"10.1109/DMO.2011.5976518","startPage":"141","endPage":"145","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd Conference on Data Mining and Optimization

An MDF needs to be tested in terms of mechanical and physical properties so that it meets the required standard. These tests are costly for they involve high amount of resources. The aim of this research is to optimize the properties of MDF so that quality-testing procedures can be reduced. A prediction model will be used to make predictions on the MDF properties. A stepwise multiple linear regression selects the predictor variables to be used as inputs to the input nodes. With these variables, the multilayer perceptron neural network with various training criteria will train the data and finally produce the prediction.

The transmitting nodes and the receiver are equipped with multiple antennas and MIMO processing abilities. For this network, we study the problem of interference-aware joint secondary user (SU) selection/scheduling and power control (JSUS-QPC). The main objective of the JSUS-QPC is to maximize the sum-rate capacity of the cognitive MIMO uplink communication system under the constraint that the interference to the primary users (PU) is below a specified level. We formulate this optimization problem as nonlinear integer programming problem. The computational complexity of finding an optimal solution to the JSUS-QPC problem by exhaustive search grows exponentially with the number of users and power levels. Therefore, we apply a Quantum Inspired Evolutionary algorithm (QIEA) to determine the suboptimal solution to the JSUS-QPC problem. The proposed scheme has low computational complexity and its results are comparable to the optimal exhaustive search algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum Inspired Evolutionary algorithm for joint user selection and power allocation for uplink cognitive MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Scheduling (SCIS)","doi":"10.1109/SCIS.2011.5976551","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Scheduling (SCIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5958171/5976542/05976551.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCIS.2011.5976551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5976542","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Inspired Evolutionary algorithm for joint user selection and power allocation for uplink cognitive MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5976551/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12145661","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Inspired Evolutionary algorithm for joint user selection and power allocation for uplink cognitive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1569384103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047952S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5958171","isNumber":"5976542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5958171","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5976542","articleId":"5976551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5976598,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyuan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinyuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37965253500"},{"name":"Binfeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Binfeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37715918200"},{"name":"Xiaobin Li","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Li","id":"37965719800"},{"name":"Su Wu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293349600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1232-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1229-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1231-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5976598","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Genetic algorithms","Availability","Optimization","Resource management","System performance","Rail transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","locomotives","maintenance engineering","optimisation","queueing theory","Taguchi methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed queuing network based modeling","maintenance system","modified genetic algorithm","railway locomotives","cost optimization model","Taguchi design method","locomotives availability level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["closed queuing network","maintenance system","modified genetic algorithm","joint optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976598","abstract":"This research develops a joint optimization model for the maintenance system of railway locomotives based on a closed queuing network, so as to optimize the maintenance resources allocation and improve the system performance in operation, maintenance and spares stages.

A neural network hazard model is utilized here to model the relationship between covariates and the hazard. In order to consider incomplete covariates, the hidden layer target data are represented to be binary random variables. This will enable the training of the two-layer neural network hazard model to be decomposed into training of two single-layer structures. The training of input-hidden structure now becomes the logistic estimation problem with part of the input and all the output (the hidden layer target) missing. However, there are two major problems for this logistic estimation. It requires assumption about the distribution of the partially observed covariates. In addition, estimation for the logistic function will become complicated when the input data has missing values. Therefore, Instead of logistic function, the general location model is adopted to represent the mixed data set which involves missing values. The training of input-hidden structure thus becomes maximisation of the likelihood of mixed continuous data (covariates) and categorical data (hidden layer targets) within the general location model. The hidden layer targets link the two single structures and are updated iteratively. After each update, the expected values of the hidden layer targets are then used for the training of hidden-output structure of the neural network hazard model. This structure is now same as a generalised linear model (GLM) and is trained by the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. The training for both input-hidden and hidden-output structures will iterate until the estimation is converged. This new approach is applied to a group of bearing data. Parts of the data are deleted deliberately to create different realisations of incomplete covariate set. The numerical study demonstrates that this new approach is capable of handling the incomplete covariate data in the survival analysis and its results outperform those of conventional incomplete covariates handling approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICQR2MSE.2011.5976602","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Quality, Reliability, Risk, Maintenance, and Safety Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962076/5976557/05976602.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Quality, Reliability, Risk, Maintenance, and Safety Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICQR2MSE.2011.5976602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5976557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survival analysis using neural network hazard model with incomplete covariate data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hazards","Training","Logistics","Artificial neural networks","Data models","Numerical models","Periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","hazards","learning (artificial intelligence)","maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["survival analysis","neural network hazard model","incomplete covariate data","hidden layer target data","binary random variables","input-hidden structure","logistic estimation problem","partially observed covariates","maximisation","generalised linear model","iteratively reweighted least squares"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["survival analysis","neural network hazard model","incomplete covariates","general location model","expectation-maximisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Survival analysis using neural network hazard model with incomplete covariate data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5976602/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12171501","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survival analysis using neural network hazard model with incomplete covariate data","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"146ICQR2MSE20110291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063484S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962076","isNumber":"5976557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962076","xplore-issue":"5976557","articleId":"5976602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5976635,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Wei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li-Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37965525100"},{"name":"Hong-Wei Luo","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Reliability Physics and Application of Electronic Component Laboratory, CEPREI Laboratories, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Wei","lastName":"Luo","id":"38183163800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1232-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1229-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1231-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5976635","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trojan horses","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Power measurement","Payloads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit testing","network analysis","security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power analysis","Trojan circuits","semiconductor industry","IC fabrication","security critical applications","hardware Trojan","nondestructive power analysis","FPGA","Xilinx Spartan-3E chips","data encryption standard cipher circuit","statistic signal processing","testing","size 90 nm","word length 64 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power analysis","side-channel analysis","singular value decomposition","trojan circuit detection"]}],"abstract":"Because of globalization of the semiconductor industry, the IC fabrication is increasingly outsourced.

Therefore, it can be said that the driver transistor dominates the RTS noise of the source follower block.","doi":"10.1109/ICMTS.2011.5976865","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE ICMTS International Conference on Microelectronic Test Structures","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE ICMTS International Conference on Microelectronic Test Structures","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959845/5976839/05976865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMTS.2011.5976865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5976839","startPage":"87","endPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupling of RTS noise in high density CMOS image sensor using new test structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling of RTS noise in high density CMOS image sensor using new test structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976865/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12170120","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5976865/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling of RTS noise in high density CMOS image sensor using new test structures","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066411S","chronDate":"4-7 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959845","isNumber":"5976839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959845","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5976839","articleId":"5976865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5976877,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Revelant","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Villach, Austria","DIEGM, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Udine, Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Revelant","id":"37957308500"},{"name":"Luca Lucci","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Villach, Austria"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Lucci","id":"37268182800"},{"name":"Luca Selmi","affiliation":["DIEGM, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Udine, Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Selmi","id":"37269441100"},{"name":"Benno Ankele","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Villach, Austria"],"firstName":"Benno","lastName":"Ankele","id":"37388824400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8529-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8526-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8528-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1029"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1071-9032"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1071-9032"}],"articleNumber":"5976877","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device variability and correlation control by automated tuning of SPICE cards to PCM measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976877","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Semiconductor device modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Correlation","Foundries","SPICE","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit tuning","integrated circuit modelling","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","Monte Carlo methods","process control","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["device variability","correlation control","automated tuning","SPICE cards","PCM measurements","nominal SPICE models","structured handling","PCM data","mixed-signal system-on-chip product development environment","CMOS technology node","real time process control","model-hardware correlation problems","multifoundry design environment","production sites","process variability","worst-case corner models","Monte Carlo simulations","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"We present an improved methodology to calibrate nominal SPICE models to individual or average PCM measurements at the die, wafer or lot level.

Without the ability of emotions processing, computers and robots cannot communicate with human in natural way. In this paper we presented the classification of human emotions using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG signals are collected from 20 subjects through 62 active electrodes, which are placed over the entire scalp based on International 10-10 system. An audio-visual (video clips) stimuli based protocol has been designed for evoking the discrete emotions. The raw EEG signals are preprocessed through Surface Laplacian filtering method and decomposed into five different EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) using Wavelet Transform (WT). We have considered three different wavelet functions namely: \u201cdb4\u201d, \u201cdb8\u201d, \u201csym8\u201d and \u201ccoif5\u201d for extracting the statistical features from the preprocessed signal. In this work, we have investigated the efficacy of emotion classification for two different set of EEG channels (62 channels & 24 channels). The validation of statistical features is performed using 5 fold cross validation and classified by using linear non-linear (KNN - K Nearest Neighbor) classifier. KNN gives a maximum average classification rate of 82.87 % on 62 channels and 78.57% on 24 channels, respectively. Finally we present the average classification accuracy and individual classification accuracy of KNN for justifying the performance of our emotion recognition system.","doi":"10.1109/ICPAIR.2011.5976886","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Pattern Analysis and Intelligence Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference

crack detection using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","abstract":"A solar cell panel as an efficient power source for the production of electrical energy has long been considered. Any defect on the solar cell panel's surface will be lead to reduced production of power and loss in the yield. In this case, inspection of the solar cell panel is essential to be performed to obtain a product of high quality. Some inspection methods have been developed, but in any event non-contact, non-destructive and efficient testing methods are necessary. This paper proposes an automated inspection system based on an image-processing approach for solar cell panel application in order to detect any cracks which may be appeared on the surface of solar cell panel. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm as a main constituent of our proposed method is used for edge detection in the solar cell panel. Subsequently, some features like cracks and bus bars will be extracted and we will classify defected products and cracks based on the positions of the bus bars using Fuzzy logic. In this proposed method, an automated inspection system of solar cell panel proposed which has potential to get good results based on Particle Swarm optimization algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5976888/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12170768","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5976888/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","conferenceDate":"28-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solar cell panel crack detection using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solar cell panel crack detection using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"B3004ICC04PaperID68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044712S","chronDate":"28-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959908","isNumber":"5976881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959908","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5976881","articleId":"5976888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5976889,"authors":[{"name":"Teuku Muhammad Johan","affiliation":["Center of Artificial Intelligence Technology (CAIT), Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Teuku Muhammad","lastName":"Johan","id":"37951776200"},{"name":"Anton Satria Prabuwono","affiliation":["Center of Artificial Intelligence Technology (CAIT), Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Anton Satria","lastName":"Prabuwono","id":"37294154000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-406-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-407-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-405-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5976889","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5976889","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fasteners","Artificial neural networks","Training","MATLAB","Image processing","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobile industry","automotive components","backpropagation","conveyors","fasteners","image motion analysis","neural nets","object detection","object recognition","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bolt recognition","nut recognition","artificial neural network","automotive industry","image processing algorithm","normalized cropping image","learning process","backpropagation neural network","real-time visual recognition system","Matlab software","stepper motor","moving object detection","belt conveyor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pattern recognition","bolt and nut","artificial neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPAIR.2011.5976889","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959908/5976881/05976889.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Pattern Analysis and Intelligence Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Pattern Analysis and Intelligence Robotics","startPage":"165","endPage":"170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5976881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPAIR.2011.5976889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of bolt and nut using artificial neural network","abstract":"This paper focuses on the recognition system of bolt and nut in real time for application in various industries, particularly the automotive industry.

The firing pin impression image on a cartridge case from a fired bullet is one of the most significant clues in firearms identification. In this study, a set of data which focused on selected 6 features of firing pin impression images before an entirety of five different pistols of South African made; the Parabellum Vector SPI 9mm model, were used. The numerical features are geometric moments of whole image computed from a total of 747 cartridge case images. Under pattern recognition theory, the supervised features of firing pin impression images were then trained and validated using a two-layer backpropagation neural network (BPNN) design with computed hidden layers. A two-layer 6-7-5 connections BPNN of sigmoid/linear transfer functions with `trainlm' algorithm was found to yield the best classification result using cross-validation, where 96% of the images were correctly classified according to the pistols used.

The gate voltage independence of the energy spacing between the conduction and valence bands at the heterojunction is the key to producing a constant S <; 60 mV/decade, which can be tuned by properly engineering the material composition at this interface. In contrast to the tunneling field-effect transistor, the tunnel junction in the BG-TMOS is independent of the electrostatics in the channel region, enabling the use of 2-D architectures for improved current drive without degradation of S -attractive features from a circuit design perspective. Simulations show that the BG-TMOS can exceed MOSFET performance at low supply voltages.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/6028517/05977000.pdf","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/LED.2011.2162220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2011.2162220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6028517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5977000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broken-Gap Tunnel MOSFET: A Constant-Slope Sub-60-mV/decade Transistor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Logic gates","Tunneling","Transistors","Junctions","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","MOSFET","tunnelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broken-gap tunnel MOSFET","constant-slope transistor","low-power transistor device","ungated broken-gap heterostructure Esaki region","gate voltage independence","energy spacing","valence bands","tunneling field-effect transistor","tunnel junction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broken gap","constant slope","heterostructure","low power","steep-slope transistor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Broken-Gap Tunnel MOSFET: A Constant-Slope Sub-60-mV/decade Transistor","volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5977000/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12245377","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broken-Gap Tunnel MOSFET: A Constant-Slope Sub-60-mV/decade Transistor","sourcePdf":"led-smith-2162220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053425S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6028517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6028517","articleId":"5977000","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5977003,"authors":[{"name":"Bumshik Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bumshik","lastName":"Lee","id":"38184540700"},{"name":"Munchurl Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Munchurl","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291553900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5977003","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2067},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Transforms","Laplace equations","Pixel","Encoding","Rate distortion theory","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","Laplace transforms","quadtrees","statistical distributions","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modeling rates","interpredicted residues","quadtree coding","HEVC","inprobability model based rate control","residual distribution","precise distortions","appropriate quantization parameter values","single probability model approaches","statistical characteristics","variable block-sized coding","distortion models","multiple Laplacian distributions","transform coefficients","high efficiency video coding test model","quadtree-structured coding unit","transform unit","rate estimation","distortion estimation","single probability models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HEVC","quadtree coding","rate-distortion model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5977003","abstract":"Inprobability model based rate control of video coding, modeling of residual distribution is important in predicting precise distortions so as to determine appropriate quantization parameter values.

As opposed to traditional networked control schemes where the nodes simply route information to and from a dedicated controller (perhaps performing some encoding along the way), our approach treats the network itself as the controller. Specifically, we formulate a strategy for each node in the network to follow, where at each time-step, each node updates its internal state to be a linear combination of the states of the nodes in its neighborhood. We show that this causes the entire network to behave as a linear dynamical system, with sparsity constraints imposed by the network topology. We provide a numerical design procedure to determine appropriate linear combinations to be applied by each node so that the transmissions of the nodes closest to the actuators will stabilize the plant. We also show how our design procedure can be modified to maintain mean square stability under packet drops in the network, and present a distributed scheme that can handle node failures while preserving stability. We call this architecture a Wireless Control Network, and show that it introduces very low computational and communication overhead to the nodes in the network, allows the use of simple transmission scheduling algorithms, and enables compositional design (where the existing wireless control infrastructure can be easily extended to handle new plants that are brought online in the vicinity of the network).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2163864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6032784/05977006.pdf","startPage":"2305","endPage":"2318","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2163864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Wireless Control Network: A New Approach for Control Over Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"The Wireless Control Network: A New Approach for Control Over Networks","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5977006/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270723","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Wireless Control Network: A New Approach for Control Over Networks","sourcePdf":"tac-pajic-2163864-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180742S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6032784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6032784","articleId":"5977006","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5977009,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6032784/5977009/5977009-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Zhang (S'89\u2013SM'98) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, the M.S. degree from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, all in electrical engineering and computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science (Electrical Engineering-Systems) from The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.","He is currently an Associate Professor and the Founding Director of the Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station.

We develop the optimal mutual-information based techniques to adaptively control the reconfiguration of the proposed MWSN by designing the Distributed/Decentralized Probability Hypothesis Density (DPHD) filtering algorithms. By dynamically adjusting the sensors' states, including their positions and activations, our schemes can efficiently improve the observabilities of the tracked multi-targets. We further analyze the asymptotic performance of our proposed schemes by deriving the upper-bounds of the detection-error probabilities. Also presented are the performance analyses which validate and evaluate our proposed adaptive control and reconfiguration schemes for MWSN in terms of the multi-target states estimation accuracy, the energy-consumption efficiency, and the robustness to the interference/noise.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2163862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6032784/05977009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2163862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032784","startPage":"2429","endPage":"2444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Control and Reconfiguration of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks for Dynamic Multi-Target Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5977009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Control and Reconfiguration of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks for Dynamic Multi-Target Tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270726","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5977009/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Control and Reconfiguration of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks for Dynamic Multi-Target Tracking","sourcePdf":"tac-zhang-2163862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131385S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6032784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6032784","articleId":"5977009","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5977010,"authors":[{"name":"Minyi Zhong","affiliation":["Division of Systems Engineering, Center for Information and Systems Engineering, Boston University, Brookline, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6032784/5977010/5977010-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minyi Zhong (M'10) received the B.E. degree in electrical and information engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2005, and the M.S. and Ph.D degree from Boston University, Boston, MA, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently working at Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA.

The control system for the mission is composed of three components executed in parallel on sensor nodes: coverage control, data source detection, and data collection. In order to maximize the joint detection probability of random events in a given mission space, we build upon a previously developed distributed gradient-based coverage control scheme to include three additional capabilities: allowing polygonal obstacles, including limited sensing field-of-view constraints, and preserving network connectivity through a provably correct algorithm using each node's routing information. In order to combine coverage and data collection, we formulate and solve a modified optimization problem with these two objectives. The interactions among the three components of the sensor network control system are discussed and simulation examples are presented to illustrate our results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5977010/","accessionNumber":"12270727","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Coverage Control and Data Collection With Mobile Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Coverage Control and Data Collection With Mobile Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tac-zhong-2163860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091207S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6032784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"6032784","articleId":"5977010","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5977022,"authors":[{"name":"Ayman S.

However, their inability to produce high quality travelling fields has limited their application from spreading to induction machines. This paper presents the design considerations and tradeoffs involved in applying FSCWs to five-phase induction machines using the conventional three-phase lap wound machine as a reference. Previous work has touched upon the application of modular windings to three-phase induction machines, concluding that a conventional distributed winding is superior in terms of torque production and rotor bar losses. In applications such as high frequency induction machines and manually wound electrical submersible pump motors, the proposed machine topology provides advantages that may warrant its application despite an apparent power density penalty. In this paper, a prototype five-phase modular winding induction machine designed to significantly reduce the effect of space harmonics is investigated through simulations and experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2163914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6146784/05977022.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2163914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146784","startPage":"2654","endPage":"2669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Five-Phase Modular Winding Induction Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5977022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Five-Phase Modular Winding Induction Machine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12801665","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5977022/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of a Five-Phase Modular Winding Induction Machine","sourcePdf":"tie-abdelkhalik-2163914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087232S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6146784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6146784","articleId":"5977022","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5977026,"authors":[{"name":"Hector Garcia de Marina","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture and Automatics, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain","GNC group at Deimos-Space, Tres Cantos, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6220909/5977026/5977026-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hector Garcia de Marina was born in Madrid.

Integral windup is analyzed on the PI plane, and a new anti-windup PID controller is proposed to improve control performance of variable-speed motor drives and is experimentally applied to the speed control of a vector-controlled induction motor driven by a pulse width-modulated voltage source inverter. The steady-state value of the integral state is predicted while the PID controller output is saturated, and this value is utilized as an initial value of the integral state when the PID controller begins to operate in a linear range. Simulation and experiments result in more similar speed responses against load conditions and step reference change over conventional anti-windup schemes.

The algorithmic transformations and software optimizations necessary to enable embedded ECG delineation notwithstanding the limited processing and storage resources of the target platform are described, and the performance of the resulting implementations are analyzed in terms of delineation accuracy, execution time, and memory usage. Interestingly, RMS-based multilead delineation is shown to perform equivalently to the best single-lead delineation for the 2-lead QT database (QTDB), within a fraction of a sample duration of the Common Standards for Electrocardiography (CSE) committee tolerances.

The derivation of a nominal linearized model about an operating point was presented. Sine sweep test was conducted on each component of AMB control system to obtain parameter variations and high-frequency unmodeled dynamics, including the structural resonance modes. A fictitious uncertainty block was introduced to represent the performance requirements for the augmented system. Finally, D-K iteration procedure was employed to solve the robust \u03bc-controller. Rotor run-up experiments on the originally developed MSDGCMG prototype show that the designed \u03bc-controller has a good performance for vibration rejection of structural resonance mode with the excitation of coupling torques. Further investigations indicate that the proposed method can also ensure the robust stability and performance of high-speed rotor system subject to the reaction of a large gyro torque.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6301724/05977030.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on

transformation inverse consistency error. This paper provides experimental evidence that these measures, even when used in combination, cannot distinguish accurate from inaccurate registrations. To this end, we introduce a \u201cregistration\u201d algorithm that generates highly inaccurate image transformations, yet performs extremely well in terms of the surrogate measures. Of the tested criteria, only overlap scores of localized anatomical regions reliably distinguish reasonable from inaccurate registrations, whereas image similarity and tissue overlap do not. We conclude that tissue overlap and image similarity, whether used alone or together, do not provide valid evidence for accurate registrations and should thus not be reported or accepted as such.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2011.2163944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6142636/05977031.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2011.2163944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Similarity and Tissue Overlaps as Surrogates for Image Registration Accuracy: Widely Used but Unreliable","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5977031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977031/","displayDocTitle":"Image Similarity and Tissue Overlaps as Surrogates for Image Registration Accuracy: Widely Used but Unreliable","volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12508917","pubMedId":"21827972","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5977031/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Similarity and Tissue Overlaps as Surrogates for Image Registration Accuracy: Widely Used but Unreliable","sourcePdf":"tmi-rohlfing-2163944-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163305S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6142636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"6142636","articleId":"5977031","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-17"},{"_id":5977033,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Xin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex System Intelligent Control and Decision, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China","Decision and Cognitive Sciences Research Centre, Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK","School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/6269137/5977033/5977033-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Xin (S'09\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in information engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2004.

The hybridization between DE and PSO represents a promising way to create more powerful optimizers, especially for specific problem solving. In the past decade, numerous hybrids of DE and PSO have emerged with diverse design ideas from many researchers. This paper attempts to comprehensively review the existing hybrids based on DE and PSO with the goal of collection of different ideas to build a systematic taxonomy of hybridization strategies. Taking into account five hybridization factors, i.e., the relationship between parent optimizers, hybridization level, operating order (OO), type of information transfer (TIT), and type of transferred information (TTI), we propose several classification mechanisms and a versatile taxonomy to differentiate and analyze various hybridization strategies. A large number of hybrids, which include the hybrids of DE and PSO and several other representative hybrids, are categorized according to the taxonomy. The taxonomy can be utilized not only as a tool to identify different hybridization strategies, but also as a reference to design hybrid optimizers. The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation regarding hybridization design is discussed and highlighted. Based on the taxonomy proposed, this paper also indicates several promising lines of research that are worthy of devotion in future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12921109","htmlLink":"/document/5977033/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybridizing Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization to Design Powerful Optimizers: A Review and Taxonomy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybridizing Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization to Design Powerful Optimizers: A Review and Taxonomy","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-xin-2160941-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.271536S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"6269137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6269137","articleId":"5977033","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5977323,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Jaldehag","affiliation":["Measurement Technology, Communications Laboratory, Time and Frequency, SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, Boras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Jaldehag","id":"37448797300"},{"name":"Sven-Christian Ebenhag","affiliation":["Measurement Technology, Communications Laboratory, Time and Frequency, SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, Boras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sven-Christian","lastName":"Ebenhag","id":"37703699700"},{"name":"Carsten Rieck","affiliation":["Measurement Technology, Communications Laboratory, Time and Frequency, SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, Boras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Rieck","id":"37582741400"},{"name":"Per Olof Hedekvist","affiliation":["Measurement Technology, Communications Laboratory, Time and Frequency, SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, Boras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per Olof","lastName":"Hedekvist","id":"37328118100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-112-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-111-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-110-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-1949"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-1914"},{"format":"CD","value":"1075-6787"}],"articleNumber":"5977323","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Field programmable gate arrays","Optical fiber devices","Hardware","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication equipment","optical fibre networks","optical links","synchronous digital hierarchy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fiber communication network","time transfer","passive listening","SDH frame header detection","optical communication equipment","optical fiber link"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new, recently developed hardware for time transfer using passive listening and detection of SDH frame headers in fiber-optical networks is described.

However, this is only achievable if an expedient detection method is used. A common method is Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection which enables soft decisions for each received bit along with good error performance. The drawback of this method is its demanding algorithm. In order to meet real-time constraints, the ML detection can be approximated. In this paper, we compare three different implementations of the soft sphere decoder: the single tree search which achieves true ML performance, a conventional k-best algorithm that delivers approximated ML detection, and a novel improved k-best algorithm with better ML approximation at cost of slightly increased execution time. We examine different performance aspects of these sphere decoder implementations and give a recommended complexity-border which indicates where the usage of an ML approximation becomes appropriate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977346/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12177831","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5977346/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Soft-output sphere decoding: Single tree search vs. improved k-best","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-output sphere decoding: Single tree search vs. improved k-best","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048752S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959911","isNumber":"5977204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959911","xplore-issue":"5977204","articleId":"5977346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IWSSIP Sarajevo","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5977357,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandr Timoshenko","affiliation":["Telecommunication Systems Department, Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, Technical University, TU MIET, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Timoshenko","id":"37426205600"},{"name":"Leonid Pertsev","affiliation":["Telecommunication Systems Department, Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, Technical University, TU MIET, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Pertsev","id":"37947379100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9958-9966-1-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-9958-9966-3-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8702"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8672"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-8672"}],"articleNumber":"5977357","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Transceivers","Field programmable gate arrays","Synchronization","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","differential phase shift keying","field programmable gate arrays","modems","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog-to-digital converter","ADC limitation analysis","digital DQPSK modem","digital FPGA","ADC resolution","ADC sampling rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["\u03c0/4 DQPSK","ADC limits","digital transceiver","digital modem","Reed-Solomon code","BER versus SNR","ADC resolution","ADC sampling rate","multimedia communication"]}],"abstract":"This paper present the relationship between the performance of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and the digital FPGA and/or IC based \u03c0/4 DQPSK.

There is a trade-off between the unwanted and useful amount of extracted information. From quality aspect, the matched filtering approach is preferable, as it significantly reduces the amount of unwanted information; however, the segmentation of filtered images usually is difficult. Complex matched filtering does the opposite: it provides the additional information, which simplifies the segmentation procedure; however, the resulting images are filled with the unwanted artifacts. This paper introduces the improved 2D complex matched filtering approach. The approach discussed in this paper doesn't produce the unwanted artifacts and still retains the angular information about the extracted objects.

Contrary to the case of a moving sensor pair the fact of correlated measurements in a single time step arises dependent on the choice of the measurement set. In tracking simulations, the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and simulation results are often computed assuming constant standard deviations of the incoming measurements. Though, the measurement error is parameter dependent, it depends for example on the emitter-sensors-geometry. In Monte Carlo simulations, a comparison is performed between the localization in a static sensor network with three sensors and the localization using a moving sensor pair. Measurements are generated assuming additive white Gaussian noise with constant and parameter dependent variance.

This paper is concerned with algorithms for automated anomaly detection in trajectory data. Based on the theory of Conformal prediction, we propose the Similarity based Nearest Neighbour Conformal Anomaly Detector (SNN-CAD) which is a parameter-light algorithm for on-line learning and anomaly detection with well-calibrated false alarm rate. The only design parameter in SNN-CAD is the dissimilarity measure. We propose two parameter-free dissimilarity measures based on Hausdorff distance for comparing multi-dimensional trajectories of arbitrary length. One of these measures is appropriate for sequential anomaly detection in incomplete trajectories. The proposed algorithms are evaluated using two public data sets. Results show that high sensitivity to labelled anomalies and low false alarm rate can be achieved without any parameter tuning.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Conformal Anomaly Detection in trajectories based on Hausdorff distance","publicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Information Fusion","displayPublicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959904/5977431/05977571.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5977431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5977571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Conformal Anomaly Detection in trajectories based on Hausdorff distance","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5977571/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12177658","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Conformal Anomaly Detection in trajectories based on Hausdorff distance","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"a21laxhammar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078747S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959904","isNumber":"5977431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959904","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5977431","articleId":"5977571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Intl Society of Info Fusion","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5977582,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Hung Ren Ko","affiliation":["Decision Support Systems for Command and Control (DSS-C2) section, Defence Research and Development Canada, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Albert Hung Ren","lastName":"Ko","id":"37283722600"},{"name":"Anne-Laure Jousselme","affiliation":["Decision Support Systems for Command and Control (DSS-C2) section, Defence Research and Development Canada, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Anne-Laure","lastName":"Jousselme","id":"37284799700"},{"name":"Patrick Maupin","affiliation":["Decision Support Systems for Command and Control (DSS-C2) section, Defence Research and Development Canada, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Maupin","id":"37270960200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9824438-2-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0267-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-9824438-3-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5977582","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency measurement","Control charts","Time series analysis","Time measurement","Current measurement","Harmonic analysis","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biohazards","security of data","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data stream anomaly detection","bio-surveillance system","decision makers","false alarm rate","anomaly frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bio-surveillance","Harmonic Regression","Fourier Transformation","Control Chart","Over-the-Counter Drug Sales"]}],"abstract":"The primary concern of a bio-surveillance system is to analyze and interpret data as they are collected and then decide whether further investigation is required.

Range scanners and depth sensors are one of the most popular sensors used in mobile robotics to accomplish several higher level tasks such as local planning, obstacle avoidance, and mapping and localization among others. For any application, it has been observed with laser range-scanners and depth sensors, that the sampling density, i.e., the number of range measurements per unit length of the scanned contour, can vary greatly even within a single scan measurement. The number of samples and their distribution are important factors, for example, when estimating the alignment between two range scans obtained from two different positions. In this paper, an on-line placement algorithm is proposed that computes where the robot must move next so that it is able to sample the environment uniformly and densely. The algorithm guarantees that a minimum number of measurements per unit length of the observed space is obtained, i.e. a high spatial measurement density. At any given time instant the robot computes a Next-Best-View relative to its current position while satisfying a locally-defined constraint function based on the sampling density of points. Two variants of this algorithm, suitable for different practical applications are demonstrated with experiments on real robots in interesting scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Density measurement","Equations","Current measurement","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","laser ranging","mobile robots","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic sensor placement algorithm","dense sampling","range scanners","depth sensors","mobile robotics","local planning","obstacle avoidance","mapping and localization","laser range-scanners","sampling density","range measurements","scanned contour","single scan measurement","online placement algorithm","spatial measurement density","locally-defined constraint function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reactive Sensing","Adaptive Systems"]}],"publicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Information Fusion","displayPublicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/5959904/5977431/05977613.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5977431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic sensor placement algorithm for dense sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5977613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic sensor placement algorithm for dense sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5977613/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5977613/","accessionNumber":"12177699","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic sensor placement algorithm for dense sampling","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"a259bhatawadekar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061059S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5959904","isNumber":"5977431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5959904","xplore-issue":"5977431","articleId":"5977613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Intl Society of Info Fusion","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5977674,"authors":[{"name":"Thyagaraju Damarla","affiliation":["U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Thyagaraju","lastName":"Damarla","id":"37329883800"},{"name":"Asif Mehmood","affiliation":["U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Asif","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"37970328900"},{"name":"James Sabatier","affiliation":["U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Sabatier","id":"37272315800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9824438-2-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0267-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-9824438-3-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5977674","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":681},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5977674","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Acoustics","Humans","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Horses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","sensor fusion","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonimaging sensors","acoustic transducers","seismic transducers","ultrasonic transducers","personnel detection","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Personnel detection","sensor fusion","phenomenology","acoustic","seismic and ultrasonic"]}],"abstract":"Non-imaging sensors offer low power and long lasting solutions for perimeter, border crossing, and forward operating base protection.

Both predistorters and equalizers have been used for nonlinearity compensation and electrical compensation has become a popular choice among optical communication engineers in recent years. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no comparative study about electrical equalizers and predistorters has been conducted for optical communication systems. Using a coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) system as a test system, we investigated the performance of electrical \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n th-order inverse Volterra predistorters and equalizers. Our research results show that both the equalizer and the predistorter can compensate for the nonlinearity of the CO-OFDM system. The major difference between the predistorter and the equalizer is that the predistorter regulates the input power; therefore, the performance of the CO-OFDM system with a predistorter is independent over a wide range of the laser launch power. The results presented in this paper can lead to a better understanding of electrical equalization and predistortion techniques for optical communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2011","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978171/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206309","volume":"29","issue":"18","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Electrical Predistortion and Equalization for the Coherent Optical Communication System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Electrical Predistortion and Equalization for the Coherent Optical Communication System","sourcePdf":"jlt-cheng-2164056-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067753S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5986810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5986810","articleId":"5978171","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5978173,"authors":[{"name":"Simo Sarkka","affiliation":["Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6178352/5978173/5978173-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Simo S\u00e4rkk\u00e4 (S'04\u2013M'06) was born in Tampere, Finland, 1976.

The performance of the method is experimentally verified at 890 MHz using a commercially available RFID reader.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Based UHF RFID Tracking With Nonlinear Kalman Filtering and Smoothing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2011.2164062","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6178352/05978173.pdf","startPage":"904","endPage":"910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2011.2164062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Based UHF RFID Tracking With Nonlinear Kalman Filtering and Smoothing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5978173/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12650270","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Based UHF RFID Tracking With Nonlinear Kalman Filtering and Smoothing","sourcePdf":"jsen-sarkka-2164062-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105579S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6178352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6178352","articleId":"5978173","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5978174,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Woo Yang","affiliation":["Graduate School of NID Fusion Technology, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea","Graduate School of NID Fusion Technology, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, Rep. of Korea"],"firstName":"Chan-Woo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404774000"},{"name":"Young-Bae Jung","affiliation":["Division of Electrics, Electronics and Control Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, Rep. of Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Bae","lastName":"Jung","id":"37085946732"},{"name":"Chang Won Jung","affiliation":["Graduate School of NID Fusion Technology, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, Rep. of Korea"],"firstName":"Chang Won","lastName":"Jung","id":"37277023800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5978174","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2027},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile antennas","Antenna measurements","Mobile handsets","GSM","Reflection","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","code division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","multifrequency antennas","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["octaband internal antenna","4G mobile handset","wide frequency bands","octabands LTE","frequency 698 MHz to 960 MHz","frequency 1710 MHz to 2690 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["4G","internal antenna","Long-Term Evolution (LTE)","mobile handset","octaband"]}],"abstract":"A compact internal antenna that is composed of a coupled loop with two branch lines is presented.

In this work, we propose a framework for real-time video surveillance with pan-tilt cameras where the video coding and transmission as well as the automated camera control are jointly optimized by taking into account the surveillance video quality requirement and the resource constraint of WSANs. The main contributions of this work are: i) an automated camera control method is developed for moving target tracking based on the received surveillance video clip in consideration of the impact of video transmission delay on camera control decision making; ii) a content-aware video coding and transmission scheme is investigated to save network node resource and maximize the received video quality under the delay constraint of moving target monitoring. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed optimization framework over existing systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6032784/05978185.pdf","startPage":"2467","endPage":"2472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2164034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2164034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Surveillance Over Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks Using Active Cameras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Streaming media","Delay","Video coding","Video surveillance","Wireless sensor networks","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position control","video coding","video surveillance","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video surveillance","wireless sensor and actuator network","WSAN","active camera","content-aware video coding","pan-tilt camera","automated camera control","target tracking","video transmission delay","video quality","delay constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Camera control","content-aware video coding and transmission","video tracking","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Video Surveillance Over Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks Using Active Cameras","volume":"56","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270729","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Surveillance Over Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks Using Active Cameras","sourcePdf":"tac-ci-2164034-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048711S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6032784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"31","articleId":"5978185","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5978188,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Ghaffarkhah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Ghaffarkhah","id":"37542622800"},{"name":"Yasamin Mostofi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Yasamin","lastName":"Mostofi","id":"37274357800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5978188","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1256},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication-Aware Motion Planning in Mobile Networks","abstract":"In this technical note, we propose a communication-aware motion planning framework to increase the probability that a robot maintains its connectivity to a fixed station, while accomplishing a sensing task, in realistic communication environments. We use a probabilistic multi-scale model for channel characterization. Using this model, we propose a probabilistic framework for assessing the spatial variations of a wireless channel, based on a small number of measurements. We then show how our channel learning framework can be utilized for devising communication-aware motion planning strategies. We first present communication-aware objective functions that can plan the trajectory of the robot in order to improve its online channel assessment in an environment. We then propose a communication-aware target tracking approach for the case where a fixed station utilizes a robot (or a number of them) to keep track of the position of a moving target. In this approach, probabilistic channel assessment metrics are combined with sensing goals, when controlling the motion, in order to increase the amount of information that the fixed station receives about the target. Finally, we show the performance of our framework, using both real and simulated channel measurements. Overall, our results indicate that networked robotic operations can benefit considerably from our probabilistic channel assessment and its integration with sensing/motion planning.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6032784/05978188.pdf","startPage":"2478","endPage":"2485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2164033","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2164033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978188","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Robots","Fading","Base stations","Planning","Trajectory","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication-aware motion planning","mobile networks","robot","communication environment","probabilistic multiscale model","channel characterization","probabilistic framework","wireless channel","channel learning framework","communication-aware objective function","online channel assessment","communication-aware target tracking","probabilistic channel assessment metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication-aware target tracking","mobile sensor networks","probabilistic channel learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Communication-Aware Motion Planning in Mobile Networks","accessionNumber":"12270731","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978188/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication-Aware Motion Planning in Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"tac-ghaffarkhah-2164033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089527S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6032784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6032784","articleId":"5978188","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5978191,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The first step toward this goal is to investigate potential attack strategies and the extent of damage they can incur. The malware at each infective node may seek to contact more susceptible nodes by amplifying the transmission range and the media scanning rate and thereby accelerate its spread. This may however lead to (a) easier detection of the malware and thus more effective counter-measure by the network, and (b) faster depletion of the battery which may in turn thwart further spread of the infection and/or exploitation of that node. We assume the viewpoint of the malware and cast the problem of dynamically selecting the transmission range and media access rate of the infective nodes as an optimal control problem. We utilize Pontryagin's maximum principle to find an optimum solution, and prove that the maximum damage can be attained using simple three-phase bang-bang strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2163881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2163881","startPage":"2358","endPage":"2368","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6032784/05978191.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Damage Battery Depletion Attack in Mobile Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Damage Battery Depletion Attack in Mobile Sensor Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","volume":"56","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978191/","accessionNumber":"12270732","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978191/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Damage Battery Depletion Attack in Mobile Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tac-khouzani-2163881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083512S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6032784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6032784","articleId":"5978191","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5978196,"authors":[{"name":"Hidehisa Nakayama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Intelligent Systems, Tohoku Institute of Technology, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6032784/5978196/5978196-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hidehisa Nakayama (M'06) received the B.E. degree from the Department of Information Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Graduate School of Information Sciences (GSIS), Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.","He joined the GSIS as an Assistant Professor in 2005.

In order to control effectively the physical system in a WSN, actuators may be employed to integrate such environmental information into the automation control system. Indeed, sophisticated entities deployed in wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) act as functional robots. The approach of using the mobile sink, as an example of the actuator to control the movement of a sink, has been adopted by researchers in the past to achieve high efficiency in terms of gathering data from the sensors. This is due to the fact that in general, the sensors alone are unable to control the sink and need to send or relay a smaller amount of packet data. Although a number of methods exist in literature to utilize mobile sinks as actuators, most of these techniques are unable to guarantee data gathering from all of the sensors. As a consequence, more research effort is needed to improve the efficiency as well as fairness of data gathering. In WSANs, sinks and sensor entities should be actively controllable by the administrator. Therefore, we must consider an efficient way to access all nodes in the target networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, based on the set packing algorithm and traveling salesman problem, to accomplish this goal. The effectiveness of our envisioned method is demonstrated through extensive computer-simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2163872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6032784/05978196.pdf","endPage":"2389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Scheme for WSAN Sink Mobility Based on Clustering and Set Packing Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2163872","startPage":"2381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Scheme for WSAN Sink Mobility Based on Clustering and Set Packing Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978196/","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12270736","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978196/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Scheme for WSAN Sink Mobility Based on Clustering and Set Packing Techniques","sourcePdf":"tac-nakayama-2163872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060802S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6032784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6032784","articleId":"5978196","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5978197,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Notarstefano","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Lecce, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6032784/5978197/5978197-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giuseppe Notarstefano (M'10) received the Laurea degree (with highest honors) in electronics engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in automation and operation research from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2007.","He is \u201cRicercatore\u201d (Assistant Professor) at the University of Lecce, Lecce, Italy, since February 2007.

Neglecting the finite communication data rate constraint and under undirected graphs, a necessary and sufficient condition for consensusability under a common control protocol is given, which explicitly reveals how the intrinsic entropy rate of the agent dynamic and the communication graph jointly affect consensusability. The result is established by solving a discrete-time simultaneous stabilization problem. A lower bound of the optimal convergence rate to consensus, which is shown to be tight for some special cases, is provided as well. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition for formationability of multi-agent systems is obtained. As a special case, the discrete-time second-order consensus is discussed where an optimal control gain is designed to achieve the fastest convergence. The effects of undirected graphs on consensability/formationability and optimal convergence rate are exactly quantified by the ratio of the second smallest to the largest eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix. An extension to directed graphs is also made. The consensus problem under a finite communication data rate is finally investigated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Topology and Communication Data Rate for Consensusability of Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2164017","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6032784/05978201.pdf","startPage":"2262","endPage":"2275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2164017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978201/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Network Topology and Communication Data Rate for Consensusability of Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5978201/","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270740","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Topology and Communication Data Rate for Consensusability of Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-xie-2164017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114277S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6032784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"371","xplore-issue":"6032784","articleId":"5978201","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5978202,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanlong Yu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, NEW, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563672/6167349/5978202/5978202-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuanlong Yu received the B.Eng. degree in automatic control from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2000, the M.Eng. degree in computer applied technology from the Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada, in 2010.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

The attention mechanism involves the top-down and bottom-up ways that correspond to the goal-directed and automatic perceptual behaviors, respectively. Rather than considering the automatic perception, this paper presents an artificial system of the goal-directed visual perception by using the object-based top-down visual attention mechanism. This cognitive system can guide the perception to an object of interest according to the current task, context and learned knowledge. It consists of three successive stages: preattentive processing, top-down attentional selection and post-attentive perception. The preattentive processing stage divides the input scene into homogeneous proto-objects, one of which is then selected by the top-down attention and finally sent to the post-attentive perception stage for high-level analysis. Experimental results of target detection in the cluttered environments are shown to validate this system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978202/","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5978202/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12578215","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Goal-Directed Visual Perception System Using Object-Based Top\u2013Down Attention","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Goal-Directed Visual Perception System Using Object-Based Top\u2013Down Attention","sourcePdf":"tamd-yu-2163513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12339S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"6167349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6167349","articleId":"5978202","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5978204,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao-Yang Cai","affiliation":["Engineering Institute of Corporations, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6033668/5978204/5978204-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhao-Yang Cai was born in Henan province, China, in 1985.

This, however, leads to a large problem which is a challenge to model. In this paper a transmission scenario is modeled which includes transmit and receive cavity backed slot (CBS) antennas on the body of a male adult. The slots are backed with cavities in order to get unidirectional radiation patterns and decrease the near field body interaction of the slots. The scenario is simulated with finite difference time domain (FDTD) method in combination with a time domain Huygens' (TDH) technique in order to reduce the computational load. A cylindrical numerical phantom including 15 different tissue types is modeled to represent the upper body of a male. The predicted transmission coefficient, return loss and radiation patterns obtained using the TDH method are shown to be in agreement with the resource intensive direct FDTD approach but are obtained in approximately 30% of the time.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6033668/05978205.pdf","startPage":"3910","endPage":"3917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2163786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2163786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6033668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Body Transmission at 5.2 GHz: Simulations Using FDTD With a Time Domain Huygens' Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Slot antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","directive antennas","finite difference time-domain analysis","slot antennas","wearable antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-body transmission","time domain Huygen technique","on-body communication system","cavity backed slot antenna","unidirectional radiation pattern","near field body interaction","finite difference time domain method","computational load","cylindrical numerical phantom","transmission coefficient","TDH method","resource intensive direct FDTD approach","frequency 5.2 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite difference time domain technique","Huygens' technique","on-body transmission","slot antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"On-Body Transmission at 5.2 GHz: Simulations Using FDTD With a Time Domain Huygens' Technique","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5978205/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270665","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Body Transmission at 5.2 GHz: Simulations Using FDTD With a Time Domain Huygens' Technique","sourcePdf":"tap-dumanli-2163786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055583S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6033668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6033668","articleId":"5978205","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5978206,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Neto","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department of the EEMCS Faculty, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6033668/5978206/5978206-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Neto (M'00\u2013SM'10) received the Laurea degree (summa cum laude) in electronic engineering from the University of Florence, Italy, in 1994 and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetics from the University of Siena, Italy, in 2000.

Like most phased arrays, they are designed using infinite array theory. However, when finiteness is included, edge effects perturb their behavior. These effects are more severe when the arrays are designed to operate over very broad frequency ranges, since the mutual coupling between the elements facilitates the propagation of edge-born waves that can become dominant over large portions of the arrays. Finite array simulations, which would predict these behaviors, are computationally unwieldy. In this paper we present a Green's function based procedure to assess edge effects in finite connected arrays. First the electric current distribution on the array is rigorously derived. Later on, the introduction of a few simplifying assumptions allows the derivation of an analytical approximation for the current distribution. This latter provides meaningful insights in the induced dominant edge-wave mechanism. The efficiency of connected arrays as a function of their dimension in terms of the wavelength and of the loading feed impedances is investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6033668/05978206.pdf","startPage":"3646","endPage":"3657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2163788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2163788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6033668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge-Born Waves in Connected Arrays: A Finite-Infinite Analytical Representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current distribution","Approximation methods","Impedance","Feeds","Phased arrays","Finite element methods","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","Green's function methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge-born wave propagation","connected arrays","finite infinite analytical representation","wideband phased arrays","infinite array theory","mutual coupling","finite array simulations","Green function based procedure","electric current distribution","induced dominant edge-wave mechanism","loading feed impedances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Edge-Born Waves in Connected Arrays: A Finite<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex></formula>Infinite Analytical Representation","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5978206/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270666","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge-Born Waves in Connected Arrays: A Finite<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex></formula>Infinite Analytical Representation","sourcePdf":"tap-neto-2163788-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112918S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6033668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6033668","articleId":"5978206","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5978210,"authors":[{"name":"Kah-Hyong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6163272/5978210/5978210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kah-Hyong Chang received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 1997.

Using a direct method may involve a critically high operating frequency. This paper presents two improved digital-filter based moment accelerators, as exemplified by a Tchebichef moments computation engine, to introduce features that contribute to an area-efficient and timing-efficient accelerator design. The design of the accelerators invariably consists of two on-chip units: the digital filter and the matrix multiplication units. Among the features introduced are: a data-shifting means, a filter load distribution method, a reduced set of column filters, sectioned left shifters, a double-line buffer, time-multiplexed and pipelined matrix multiplication sections, and multichip amenable features. A total of 98 frames of test data from high definition videos, real and synthetic images are used in the functional tests. The single-chip field-programmable gate array implementation results show the successful realizations of accelerators capable of moment computations of (31, 31) orders, at 50 frames of 1920 \u00d7 1080 8-bit pixels per second, and (63, 63) orders, at 30 frames of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels per second.

The complex nonlinear dynamic system of the crane is modeled as a three-rule T-S fuzzy model with a saturated input. Based on the fuzzy model, a state-feedback controller is designed so that trajectories of the system that start from an ellipsoid will remain in it, where a decay rate is introduced to accelerate the response speed. Besides, since the input delay often appears in real equipment, the delayed feedback control is also considered with respect to the actuator saturation. Delay-dependent existence conditions of the fuzzy controller are established such that the load can be placed in a desired position by the crane with a much suppressed swing angle, where trajectories of the closed-loop system that start from a bounded set will asymptotically converge to a contractively invariant ellipsoid. The results are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which can be readily solved via standard numerical software. Simulations on the true plant are illustrated to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control method.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2164083","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6144188/05978215.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2164083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144188","startPage":"181","endPage":"186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-Model-Based Control of an Overhead Crane With Input Delay and Actuator Saturation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-Model-Based Control of an Overhead Crane With Input Delay and Actuator Saturation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509218","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-Model-Based Control of an Overhead Crane With Input Delay and Actuator Saturation","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-zhao-2164083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042783S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","isNumber":"6144188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"159","articleId":"5978215","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5978220,"authors":[{"name":"Hongliang Ren","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA","Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Childrens Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical school, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/6145490/5978220/5978220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongliang Ren received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, in Spring 2008.","He was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics and Computer-Integrated Surgical System and Technology Center, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, from 2008 to 2010.

In order to address this problem, we propose a tracking system including multiple-sensor integration and data fusion. The proposed tracking approach is free of the constraints of line-of-sight, less subject to environmental distortion, and with higher update rate. By incorporating electromagnetic and inertial sensors, the system yields continuous 6-DOF information. Based on a system dynamic model and estimation theories, a new multisensor fusion algorithm, cascade orientation and position-estimation algorithm, is proposed for the integrated tracking device. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms achieve accurate orientation and position tracking with robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978220/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12509337","pubMedId":"21827975","volume":"16","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multisensor Data Fusion in an Integrated Tracking System for Endoscopic Surgery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisensor Data Fusion in an Integrated Tracking System for Endoscopic Surgery","sourcePdf":"titb-ren-2164088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082235S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"6145490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6145490","articleId":"5978220","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5978225,"authors":[{"name":"Mikel Galar","affiliation":["Department of Autom\u00e1tica yComputaci\u00f3n, Universidad P\u00d9blica de Navarra, Navarra, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/6217351/5978225/5978225-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mikel Galar received the M.

This issue occurs when the number of examples that represent one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. In machine learning, the ensemble of classifiers are known to increase the accuracy of single classifiers by combining several of them, but neither of these learning techniques alone solve the class imbalance problem, to deal with this issue the ensemble learning algorithms have to be designed specifically. In this paper, our aim is to review the state of the art on ensemble techniques in the framework of imbalanced data-sets, with focus on two-class problems. We propose a taxonomy for ensemble-based methods to address the class imbalance where each proposal can be categorized depending on the inner ensemble methodology in which it is based. In addition, we develop a thorough empirical comparison by the consideration of the most significant published approaches, within the families of the taxonomy proposed, to show whether any of them makes a difference. This comparison has shown the good behavior of the simplest approaches which combine random undersampling techniques with bagging or boosting ensembles. In addition, the positive synergy between sampling techniques and bagging has stood out. Furthermore, our results show empirically that ensemble-based algorithms are worthwhile since they outperform the mere use of preprocessing techniques before learning the classifier, therefore justifying the increase of complexity by means of a significant enhancement of the results.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/6217351/05978225.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6217351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review on Ensembles for the Class Imbalance Problem: Bagging-, Boosting-, and Hybrid-Based Approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Review on Ensembles for the Class Imbalance Problem: Bagging-, Boosting-, and Hybrid-Based Approaches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978225/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12786352","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978225/","volume":"42","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review on Ensembles for the Class Imbalance Problem: Bagging-, Boosting-, and Hybrid-Based Approaches","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-galar-2161285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.236749S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"6217351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"1238","xplore-issue":"6217351","articleId":"5978225","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5978226,"authors":[{"name":"Dongbin Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Management of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Haidian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/6217351/5978226/5978226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongbin Zhao (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201910) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in material processing engineering all from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in August 1994, August 1996, and April 2000, respectively.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, from May 2000 to January 2002.

It consists of surface-way networks, freeway networks, and ramps with a mixed traffic flow of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Traffic congestions occur frequently, which affect daily life and pose all kinds of problems and challenges. Alleviation of traffic congestions not only improves travel safety and efficiencies but also reduces environmental pollution. Among all the solutions, traffic signal control (TSC) is commonly thought as the most important and effective method. TSC algorithms have evolved quickly, especially over the past several decades. As a result, several TSC systems have been widely implemented in the world, making TSC a major component of intelligent transportation system (ITS). In TSC and ITS, many new technologies can be adopted. Computational intelligence (CI), which mainly includes artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and evolutionary computation algorithms, brings flexibility, autonomy, and robustness to overcome nonlinearity and randomness of traffic systems. This paper surveys some commonly used CI paradigms, analyzes their applications in TSC systems for urban surface-way and freeway networks, and introduces current and potential issues of control and management of recurrent and nonrecurrent congestions in traffic networks, in order to provide valuable references for further research and development.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6217351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/6217351/05978226.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161577","startPage":"485","endPage":"494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Intelligence in Urban Traffic Signal Control: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978226/","displayDocTitle":"Computational Intelligence in Urban Traffic Signal Control: A Survey","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978226/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"12786353","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Intelligence in Urban Traffic Signal Control: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-zhao-2161577-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16358S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"6217351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"6217351","articleId":"5978226","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5978227,"authors":[{"name":"Parthajit Mohapatra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Parthajit","lastName":"Mohapatra","id":"37903439100"},{"name":"K.

A new performance metric for evaluating the efficacy of IA algorithms is proposed, which measures the extent to which the desired signal dimensionality is preserved after zero-forcing the interference at the receiver. Inspired by the metric, two algorithms are proposed for designing the linear precoders and receive filters for IA in the constant MIMO interference channel with a finite number of symbol extensions. The first algorithm uses an eigenbeamforming method to align sub-streams of the interference to reduce the dimensionality of the interference at all the receivers. The second algorithm is iterative, and is based on minimizing the interference leakage power while preserving the dimensionality of the desired signal space at the intended receivers. The improved performance of the algorithms is illustrated by comparing them with existing algorithms for IA using Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment Algorithms for the - User Constant MIMO Interference Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2164069","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6041052/05978227.pdf","startPage":"5499","endPage":"5508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2164069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041052","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978227/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment Algorithms for the <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex></formula> User Constant MIMO Interference Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288332","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment Algorithms for the <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex></formula> User Constant MIMO Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"tsp-murthy-2164069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038645S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6041052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","articleId":"5978227","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5978230,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6041052/5978230/5978230-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Liu (S'11) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Wuhan University of Technology, China, in 2006 and the M.S. degree in mathematics from Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2009.","Currently, he is working towards the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, China.

One solution to this problem is the adaptive subspace detector (ASD) with a single or multiple observations. However, the probabilities of false alarm and detection of this ASD have not been obtained yet. In this paper, these expressions are derived on the basis of a single observation, which are confirmed with Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the ASD has a constant false alarm rate property with respect to both the shared noise covariance matrix structure and the independent scaling of the noise in the test data. In addition, we prove that for the First-Order model where the signal of interest is assumed to be a deterministic but unknown vector, the ASD derived with the generalized likelihood ratio test is consistent with that derived with an ad hoc two-step design procedure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CFAR Adaptive Subspace Detector for First-Order or Second-Order Gaussian Signals Based on a Single Observation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2164073","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6041052/05978230.pdf","startPage":"5126","endPage":"5140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2164073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041052","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A CFAR Adaptive Subspace Detector for First-Order or Second-Order Gaussian Signals Based on a Single Observation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5978230/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288335","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CFAR Adaptive Subspace Detector for First-Order or Second-Order Gaussian Signals Based on a Single Observation","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2164073-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121075S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6041052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6041052","articleId":"5978230","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5978232,"authors":[{"name":"Yiping Feng","affiliation":["MHI Consulting, New Providence, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6031177/5978232/5978232-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiping Feng (S'07\u2013A'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai JiaoTong University, China, in 1998, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2010.","In 1998, he joined Lucent Technologies, China, as a system engineer in the optical network group.

The unusual phenomena can be attributed to the gate current resulting from the impact ionization coupling with the gate bias resistor, which is usually observed in the design of RF circuits to provide the gate bias. After the gate current is considered, two methods are proposed to analyze the hysteresis with the same conclusion. The cause of the encountered hysteresis is for the first time identified, and criteria for the selection of the gate bias resistor in order to avoid the hysteresis are proposed. Finally, a PA complying with these criteria is presented with good performances and without hysteresis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978235/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12357234","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DC/RF Hysteresis in Microwave pHEMT Amplifier Induced by Gate Current\u2014Diagnosis and Elimination","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC/RF Hysteresis in Microwave pHEMT Amplifier Induced by Gate Current\u2014Diagnosis and Elimination","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wang-2160966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084739S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6077122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6077122","articleId":"5978235","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5978238,"authors":[{"name":"James W.

Although weather-based modeling is common, univariate models can be useful when the lead time of interest is less than one day. A class of univariate methods that has performed well with intraday data is exponential smoothing. This paper considers five recently developed exponentially weighted methods that have not previously been used for load forecasting. These methods include several exponential smoothing formulations, as well as methods using discount weighted regression, cubic splines, and singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, this paper presents a new SVD-based exponential smoothing formulation. Using British and French half-hourly load data, these methods are compared for point forecasting up to one day ahead. Although the new SVD-based approach showed some potential, the best performing method was a previously developed exponential smoothing method. A second empirical study showed the better of the univariate methods outperforming a weather-based method up to about five hours ahead, with a combination of these methods producing the best results overall.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2161780","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6133486/05978238.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2161780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting With Exponentially Weighted Methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting With Exponentially Weighted Methods","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12486397","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5978238/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecasting With Exponentially Weighted Methods","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-taylor-2161780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062196S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6133486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6133486","articleId":"5978238","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":5978239,"authors":[{"name":"Yijia Cao","affiliation":["College of Electric and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6155182/5978239/5978239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yijia Cao (M'98) was born in Hunan Province, China in 1969.

Heavy intermittent charging load of EVs will create bottlenecks in supplying capacity and expose power system to severe security risks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent method to control EV charging loads in response to time-of-use (TOU) price in a regulated market. First, an optimized charging model is formulated to minimize the charging cost. Then, a heuristic method is implemented to minimize the charging cost considering the relation between the acceptable charging power of EV battery and the state of charge (SOC). Finally, the charging cost and energy demand in different time intervals are compared for both typical charging pattern and optimized charging pattern. Results show that the optimized charging pattern has great benefit in reducing cost and flatting the load curve if the peak and valley time periods are partitioned appropriately.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","volume":"3","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12543421","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5978239/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Optimized EV Charging Model Considering TOU Price and SOC Curve","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimized EV Charging Model Considering TOU Price and SOC Curve","sourcePdf":"tsg-li-2159630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064724S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"396","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"5978239","onlineDate":"08 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5978292,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We provide a breakdown of the global carbon footprint, which reveals that production of mobile devices and global radio access network operation will remain the major contributors, accompanied by an increasing share of emissions due to data transfer in the backbone resulting from rising mobile traffic volumes. The energy bill due to network operation will gain increasing importance in cellular business models. Furthermore, technologies to reduce energy consumption are considered a key enabler for the spread of mobile communications in developing countries. Taking into account several scenarios of technological advancement and rollout, we analyze the overall energy consumption of global radio access networks and illustrate the saving potential of green communication technologies. We conclude that, conditioned on quick implementation and alongside other \"classical\" improvements of spectral efficiency, these technologies offer the potential to serve three orders of magnitude more traffic with the same overall energy consumption as today.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","volume":"49","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12172007","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978416/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The global footprint of mobile communications: The ecological and economic perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The global footprint of mobile communications: The ecological and economic perspective","sourcePdf":"014FEHSKELAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06597S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5978402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"453","xplore-issue":"5978402","articleId":"5978416","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5978417,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Mancuso","affiliation":["INRIA Sophia Antipolis-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, France"],"bio":{"p":["Vincenzo Mancuso received his M.Sc. in electronics in 2001 and a Ph.D. in telecommunications in 2005 from the University of Palermo, Italy.

The need for green cost-efficient networks is twofold: reduce the service price and preserve the environment. In this work, we discuss the various strategies that help reduce infrastructure costs, power costs, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with no impairments on the quality of network services. These strategies range over a wide area from enhancing the electronics, to developing new energy-aware radio access protocols, to deploying enhanced base stations with tunable capacity. To reduce both capital and operational expenditures, and the GHG footprint, manufacturers propose new compact installation with lightweight antenna systems, very efficient power amplifiers, and efficient hardware and software. The resulting economy can be up to 50 percent or more by reducing the electricity bill, sparing the use of air conditioning, and deploying compact sites that would seldom require maintenance. Recent scientific publications confirm that a very high gain could be achieved by optimizing the use of base stations proactively, and huge additional improvements could be obtained by optimizing power saving mechanisms by leveraging traffic statistics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing costs and pollution in cellular networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978417","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5978402/05978417.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978417/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","displayDocTitle":"Reducing costs and pollution in cellular networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5978417/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12172008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing costs and pollution in cellular networks","sourcePdf":"015ALOUFLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043457S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5978402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5978402","articleId":"5978417","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5978418,"authors":[{"name":"Imran Ashraf","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Imran Ashraf (imran.ashraf@alcatel-Iucent.com) received a B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (major in telecommunications) from the University of Engineering & Technology (U.E.T), Lahore, Pakistan, in 2002.

Small cells have a big role to play in orchestrating a cellular network that can overcome the explosive mobile traffic upsurge at little cost to the network operator. However, if left unchecked, a large-scale small cell deployment can substantially increase the network energy consumption with strong ecological and economic implications. In this article, we introduce energy-efficient SLEEP mode algorithms for small cell base stations in a bid to reduce cellular networks' power consumption. The designed algorithms allow the hardware components in the BS to be astutely switched off in idle conditions, such that the energy consumption is modulated over the variations in traffic load. Three different strategies for algorithm control are discussed, relying on small cell driven, core network driven, and user equipment driven approaches. Based on a mixed voice and data traffic model, the algorithms present energy saving opportunities of approximately 10-60 percent in the network with respect to no SLEEP mode activation in small cells, coupled with additional capacity incentives.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5978402/05978418.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLEEP mode techniques for small cell deployments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"SLEEP mode techniques for small cell deployments","volume":"49","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978418/","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12172009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978418/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLEEP mode techniques for small cell deployments","sourcePdf":"016ASHRAFLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118364S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5978402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"257","xplore-issue":"5978402","articleId":"5978418","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5978424,"authors":[{"name":"Yalin Evren Sagduyu","affiliation":["Intelligent Automation Inc., University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yalin Evren Sagduyu (yalinsagduyu@ieee.org) received a B.S. degree from Bogazici University, Turkey, in electrical and electronics engineering and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Maryland at College Park.

Game theory provides powerful tools to model and analyze such attacks. This article discusses a class of such jamming games played at the MAC layer among a set of transmitters and jammers. The equilibrium strategies resulting from these jamming games characterize the expected performance under DoS attacks and motivate robust network protocol design for secure wireless communications. A key characteristic of distributed wireless access networks is that users do not have complete information regarding the other user's identities, the traffic dynamics, the channel characteristics, or the costs and rewards of other users. Bayesian games are shown to be useful for modeling such uncertainties under different models for the MAC layer.

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to achieve their individual objectives or a group objective. Game theory is a mathematical tool developed to understand the situations of conflict among rational entities. In this article, we consider the applications of game theory to address the problem of distributed radio resource allocation in wireless networks under uncertainty, where an individual wireless node has to make a decision without having complete information about the other nodes in the network. In particular, a noncooperative game model with incomplete information is our focus. First, different approaches to solve the distributed radio resource allocation problem under uncertainty are reviewed. Then different game theoretic approaches to resource allocation in wireless networks and related work in the literature are presented. Application of a Bayesian game is then discussed to solve the distributed resource allocation problem. To this end, we provide an example to illustrate the application of a Bayesian game-theoretic model to solve the distributed bandwidth sharing problem among multiple mobile nodes competing for the shared bandwidth from a wireless access point. In this case, a mobile node is unable to completely observe other mobile nodes' behavior (e.g., speed of movement, bandwidth demand). A distributed algorithm is proposed to obtain the bidding strategy of the mobile nodes for bandwidth auction in this game model. The Bayesian Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12172015","htmlLink":"/document/5978425/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed resource allocation in wireless networks under uncertainty and application of Bayesian game","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed resource allocation in wireless networks under uncertainty and application of Bayesian game","sourcePdf":"023HOSSAINLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050014S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5978402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5978402","articleId":"5978425","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5978427,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Rose","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"p":["Luca Rose (Iuca.rose@supelee.fr) received his B.

The term decentralized is used here to refer to scenarios where decisions (e.g., choosing a power allocation policy) are taken autonomously by devices interacting with each other (e.g., through mutual interference). The iterative long-term interaction is characterized by stable points of the wireless network called equilibria. The interest in these equilibria stems from the relevance of network stability and the fact that they can be achieved by letting radio devices to repeatedly interact over time. To achieve these equilibria, several learning techniques - the best response dynamics, fictitious play, smoothed fictitious play, reinforcement learning algorithms, and regret matching - are discussed in terms of information requirements and convergence properties. Most of the notions introduced here, for both equilibria and learning schemes, are illustrated by a simple case study, an interference channel with two transmitter-receiver pairs.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5978402/05978427.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning equilibria with partial information in decentralized wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning equilibria with partial information in decentralized wireless networks","volume":"49","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12172017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978427/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978427/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning equilibria with partial information in decentralized wireless networks","sourcePdf":"025ROSELAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123767S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5978402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5978402","articleId":"5978427","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5978428,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Bonello","affiliation":["King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"p":["Nicholas Bonello (nicholas.bonello@kaust.edu.sa) received the B.Eng.

By contrast, in this treatise, we endeavor to further develop a link between the traditional fixed-rate codes and the recently developed rateless codes by delving into their underlying attributes. This joint treatment is beneficial for two principal reasons. First, it facilitates the task of researchers and practitioners, who might be familiar with fixed-rate codes and would like to jump-start their understanding of the recently developed concepts in the rateless reality. Second, it provides grounds for extending the use of the well-understood code-design tools - originally contrived for fixed-rate codes - to the realm of rateless codes. Indeed, these versatile tools proved to be vital in the design of diverse fixed-rate-coded communications systems, and thus our hope is that they will further elucidate the associated performance ramifications of the rateless coded schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5978402/05978428.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Myths and realities of rateless coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Encoding","Noise measurement","Terminology","Parity check codes","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rateless coding","fixed-rate channel codes","rateless channel codes","well-understood codedesign tools","diverse fixed-rate-coded communications systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Myths and realities of rateless coding","volume":"49","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5978428/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12172018","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Myths and realities of rateless coding","sourcePdf":"026AISSALAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041319S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5978402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5978402","articleId":"5978428","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5978429,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Attar","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Alireza Attar [M'08] (attar@ece.ubc.ca) received his Ph.D. from King's College London, where he was awarded the UK's Virtual Centre of Excellence in Mobile and Personal Communications (Mobile VCE) scholarship.

Two types of cognitive base-stations are considered: the macro-cell evolved-NodeB (eNB) and the femtocell Home evolved NodeBs (HeNB). In the context of an isolated cell or a multi-cell LTE network, the insufficiency of traditional interference management schemes is shown. Implementation of cognitive tasks such as radio scene analysis and dynamic resource access are then introduced. We argue that such cognitive basestations can exploit their knowledge of the radio scene to intelligently allocate resources and to mitigate prohibitive Co-Channel Interference (CCI). Given the distributed architecture of LTE networks, we will elaborate on cognitive interference mitigation solutions and further propose two different Game Theoretical mechanisms to achieve CCI mitigation in a distributed manner.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5978402/05978429.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978402","startPage":"152","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference management using cognitive base-stations for UMTS LTE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference management using cognitive base-stations for UMTS LTE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12172019","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978429/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference management using cognitive base-stations for UMTS LTE","sourcePdf":"027ATTARLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04163S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5978402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5978402","articleId":"5978429","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5978449,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Wu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Education, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Wu Huang","id":"37539992000"},{"name":"Ying-Hao Tu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Education, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Hao Tu","id":"37957215200"},{"name":"Hsing-Chang Yeh","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Electronics Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsing-Chang Yeh","id":"37951122100"},{"name":"Shih-Hao Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Electronics Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Hao Liu","id":"37964577800"},{"name":"Chi-Jeng Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Electronics Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Jeng Chang","id":"37348518800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9564263-8-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-148-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-9564263-8-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5978449","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data compression","image coding","random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image observation","modified ECB operations","advanced encryption standard","encrypted cipher image","generated random numbers","NIST publications","image compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","Image Processing","Entropy","ECB"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an image encryption instead of text to observe the modified ECB mode operations in AES processing. If a plaint image contains some groups of identical colors, then the encrypted cipher image may appear some kinds of patterns at the related areas. This is a limitation of AES in ECB mode. To overcome the limitation, a straight forward approach is to make those identical colors different or to remove them. For making those inputs different before encryption, three number sequences, which are the sequential number from counter output, the non-sequential number from accumulator output and the random numbers generated from cipher function itself, are added to the image inputs. By using the different numbers and the different ways of addition, the modifications result in obtaining seven modes of operation, and four of them were defined in NIST publications. To remove the identical inputs, image compression before encryption is used. Though by adding compression and decompression seems to make the whole process more complicated, yet the processing time decreases due to the shrinking file size after image compression. These two approaches to modify ECB operation work very well as shown in the experiments.","doi":"10.1109/i-Society18435.2011.5978449","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Information Society (i-Society 2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Information Society (i-Society 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966376/5978433/05978449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/i-Society18435.2011.5978449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978433","startPage":"264","endPage":"269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image observation on the modified ECB operations in Advanced Encryption Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image observation on the modified ECB operations in Advanced Encryption Standard","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978449/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12172711","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978449/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image observation on the modified ECB operations in Advanced Encryption Standard","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"S12ES3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061472S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966376","isNumber":"5978433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966376","xplore-issue":"5978433","articleId":"5978449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5978565,"authors":[{"name":"Naser El-Bathy","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Naser","lastName":"El-Bathy","id":"38271225400"},{"name":"Ghassan Azar","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ghassan","lastName":"Azar","id":"38275650400"},{"name":"Mohammed El-Bathy","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI, United State of America"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"El-Bathy","id":"38301172300"},{"name":"Gordon Stein","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI, United State of America"],"firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Stein","id":"38289143200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-465-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-464-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"5978565","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978565","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Service oriented architecture","Information retrieval","Industries","Organizations","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","genetic algorithms","hospitals","information retrieval","medical information systems","patient diagnosis","patient treatment","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent information retrieval lifecycle architecture","clustering genetic algorithm","SOA","modern medical industries","modernization","innovative solution","patient diagnosis","hospitals","diseases","patient treatment","service-oriented architecture","strategic decision making","operational business processes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SOA","Clustering Genetic Algorithm","Medical Industries","Intelligent Agent"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EIT.2011.5978565","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962075/5978551/05978565.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2011.5978565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent information retrieval lifecycle architecture based clustering genetic algorithm using SOA for modern medical industries","abstract":"Modernization of medical industries experiences numerous challenges. The modernization requires an innovative solution to determine diagnosis of diseases and the best treatment. This solution discovers related diseases to doctors' original diagnosis and quickly reassesses the situation if their diagnosis is incorrect. It also should eliminate unnecessary treatments and testing. It shortens time spent in hospitals for patients. This research, as reported in this paper focuses on creating such a solution in the form of an Intelligent Information Retrieval Lifecycle Architecture Based Clustering Extended Genetic Algorithm Using Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The purpose of the solution is to develop concepts and techniques based on the architecture to accelerate processing time of information retrieval at lower cost. The solution provides medical tasks that support strategic decision making and operational business processes. In a SOA environment, the study of this research develops new intelligent concepts of integrating approaches of search methodologies, information retrieval, clustering, genetic algorithm, and intelligent agents. A prototype is created and examined in order to validate the concepts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978565/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12178462","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978565/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Intelligent information retrieval lifecycle architecture based clustering genetic algorithm using SOA for modern medical industries","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent information retrieval lifecycle architecture based clustering genetic algorithm using SOA for modern medical industries","confLoc":"Mankato, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072918S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962075","isNumber":"5978551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962075","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5978551","articleId":"5978565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5978576,"authors":[{"name":"Juli\u00e1n Ortega","affiliation":["Universidad EAFIT, Medellin, Colombia"],"firstName":"Juli\u00e1n","lastName":"Ortega","id":"37959127100"},{"name":"Helmuth Trefftz","affiliation":["Universidad EAFIT, Medellin, Colombia"],"firstName":"Helmuth","lastName":"Trefftz","id":"37706048600"},{"name":"Christian Trefftz","affiliation":["Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Trefftz","id":"37281796000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-465-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-464-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"5978576","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978576","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Encryption","Microprocessors","Instruction sets","Kernel","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","cryptography","multiprocessing systems","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AES parallelization","GPU","AES block cipher cryptographic algorithm","sequential open source implementation","multicore microprocessor","advanced encryption standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","cryptography","OpenMP","CUDA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EIT.2011.5978576","endPage":"5","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962075/5978551/05978576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2011.5978576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelizing AES on multicores and GPUs","abstract":"The AES block cipher cryptographic algorithm is widely used and it is resource intensive.

A sequence with digital power 0 dBW is used as the preamble at the transmitter. Compared with the traditional preamble specified in the IEEE 802.11 standards, the transmit power consumption is reduced by at least 24 dBW. However, a preamble with unit power cannot be easily detected in the time domain. Therefore, we propose a novel frequency domain symbol synchronization scheme to obtain the frame start. To our best knowledge, this is the first such published scheme that performs symbol synchronization in the frequency domain. In addition, the power consumption of this preamble is lower than other existing methods. Under an AWGN channel with a certain carrier frequency offset (CFO), the proposed method provides significant improvements compared with previously proposed methods. The proposed method provides at least 10 dB gain in extremely low SNR environment to achieve perfect timing synchronization in an AWGN channel. Furthermore, under frequency selective fading channels used in IEEE 802.16 standard with a certain CFO, the proposed algorithm performs always better than other previously proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962075/5978551/05978592.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2011.5978592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2011.5978592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency domain symbol synchronization for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Frequency domain analysis","Time domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","fading channels","frequency estimation","frequency-domain analysis","IEEE standards","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","telecommunication standards","time-domain analysis","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","synchronization technique","ultra low power transmitter","digital power","IEEE 802.11 standards","transmit power consumption","time domain","frequency domain symbol synchronization scheme","AWGN channel","carrier frequency offset","CFO","SNR environment","perfect timing synchronization","frequency selective fading channels","IEEE 802.16 standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","symbol synchronization","frequency domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Frequency domain symbol synchronization for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978592/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12178489","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency domain symbol synchronization for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Mankato, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047895S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962075","isNumber":"5978551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962075","xplore-issue":"5978551","articleId":"5978592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5978602,"authors":[{"name":"Anton S.

The Xilinx system generator allows for fixed-point logic system design, hardware/software co-simulation, and board implementation through a model-based approach. In the SDR, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is chosen as the modulation scheme for demonstration. Through a wireless link, the QPSK signal experiences amplitude attenuation, frequency and phase shifts causing rotation of the signal constellation. A phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit is designed for carrier and symbol synchronization for recovery of data from the received signal. In order to resolve the phase ambiguity of the QPSK system, a differential encoding scheme is also implemented.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2011.5978602","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962075/5978551/05978602.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2011.5978602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based software-defined radio(SDR) design using FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Model-based software-defined radio(SDR) design using FPGA","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978602/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12178499","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based software-defined radio(SDR) design using FPGA","confLoc":"Mankato, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070869S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962075","isNumber":"5978551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962075","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5978551","articleId":"5978602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5978605,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Yu","affiliation":["ECE Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37960129700"},{"name":"Yinhui Chen","affiliation":["ECE Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yinhui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37965940900"},{"name":"Haiqing Nan","affiliation":["ECE Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Haiqing","lastName":"Nan","id":"37391242300"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406409500"},{"name":"Ken Choi","affiliation":["ECE Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Choi","id":"37402857200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-465-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-464-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"5978605","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","CNTFETs","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Delay","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","elemental semiconductors","field effect transistors","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","nanotube devices","semiconductor nanotubes","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power 6-T CNFET SRAM cell","back-gate biasing technique","write delay","read delay","voltage 0.4 V","C"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["back-gate biasing","CNFET","high performance","SRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978605","abstract":"A novel low power 6-T SRAM cell operating in sub-threshold region based on CNFET is presented.

We propose an Intelligent Extended Clustering Genetic Algorithm (IECGA) using Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) to be an optimal solution for data clustering. It improves the efficiency and performance for retrieving a proper information results that satisfy user's needs. The proposed IECGA uses several mutation operators simultaneously to produce next generation. This series of random mutation process depend on chromosome best fitness in the population and rely on high relevancy as well. The mutation operation will guarantee the success of IECGA for data clustering since it expands the search. So the highly effective mutation operators the greater effects on the genetic process. Finally, IECGA for data clustering gives the user needed documents based on similarity between query matching and relevant document mechanism.

Computer vision-based automatic quality inspection and controller system is one of the solutions to this problem. In computer-vision based system a digital image obtained by a digital camera would usually have 24-bit color image. The analysis of an image with that many levels might require complicated image processing techniques. But in real-time application, where a part has to be inspected within a few milliseconds, either we have to reduce the image to a more manageable number of grey levels, usually two levels (binary image), and at the same time retain all necessary features of the original image or develop a complicated technique. A binary image can be obtained by thresholding the original image into two levels that is used as an input to the high throughput quality inspection system. In this paper, we develop a system using edge-based image segmentation techniques for quality inspection that satisfy the industrial requirements in pharmaceutical applications.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2011.5978613","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2011.5978613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978551","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962075/5978551/05978613.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capsule image segmentation in pharmaceutical applications using edge-based techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978613/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Capsule image segmentation in pharmaceutical applications using edge-based techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978613/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12178510","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capsule image segmentation in pharmaceutical applications using edge-based techniques","confLoc":"Mankato, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056594S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962075","isNumber":"5978551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962075","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5978551","articleId":"5978613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5978615,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Ramnath Ramani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Arun Ramnath","lastName":"Ramani","id":"37944174400"},{"name":"Ken Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Choi","id":"37402857200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-465-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-464-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"5978615","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1568},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Transistors","Delay","Inverters","Power demand","Noise","Writing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","SRAM chips","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["9T SRAM design","subthreshold region","VLSI design","memory circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","Sub-threshold Region","Sub-threshold SRAM Design","Voltage Scaling","Read Static Noise margin"]}],"abstract":"With technology scaling, lower power operation has become one of the key areas of importance in VLSI Design. Lowering power supply is a very good and effective technique for power reduction. Scaling the supply voltage into the sub-threshold region for low power operation is possible. Power reduction in memory circuits with a little compromise on performance is very useful as they form a major part of a digital chip. In this paper, operation of various SRAM designs in sub-threshold region is examined and the ones which overcome the challenges that arise from operating in the sub-threshold region are also explained. Among the chosen designs for performance evaluation, the successful designs were the ones which resulted in proper read and write. The 7T SRAM and 8T SRAM came up as the best among the selected ones for write and read respectively. In this paper, a new 9T SRAM design is proposed combining the advantages of these two and hence better overall performance. In case of write, the PDP of proposed 9T SRAM design is 2.80% less than the 7T SRAM, 4.48 % less than 8T SRAM, 5.64% less than 9T SRAM design and 8.5 % less than 11T SRAM. Similarly, the savings in PDP during read is 44.8 % less than 7T SRAM and 66.18 % less than 9T SRAM. It is almost same as in the 8T Design. Though PDP of the proposed design is greater than that of the 11T design, the reduced RSNM of 11T design makes it inferior the proposed design when operated in the sub-threshold region.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2011.5978615","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962075/5978551/05978615.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2011.5978615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel 9T SRAM design in sub-threshold region","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978615/","displayDocTitle":"A novel 9T SRAM design in sub-threshold region","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978615/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12178512","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel 9T SRAM design in sub-threshold region","confLoc":"Mankato, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049026S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962075","isNumber":"5978551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962075","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5978551","articleId":"5978615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5978616,"authors":[{"name":"Anil Kumar","affiliation":["Faculty of Technology, Delhi University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37715624200"},{"name":"Shampa Chakarverty","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shampa","lastName":"Chakarverty","id":"37705974900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-465-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-464-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"5978616","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1189},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978616","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Embedded systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","embedded systems","genetic algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded system design optimization","genetic algorithm","cuckoo search","GA","fitness function repeated evaluation","design space exploration","NP-complete problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design Automation","Design Space Exploration","Cauchy distribution","Heuristic algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EIT.2011.5978616","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962075/5978551/05978616.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2011.5978616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design optimization using Genetic Algorithm and Cuckoo Search","abstract":"Genetic algorithm (GA) is widely used for embedded system design optimization.

The benchmark result shows that SVM assisted GP can produce better accuracy than some other existing methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support vector machine assisted genetic programming for MQAM classification","publicationTitle":"ISSCS 2011 - International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2011.5978654","displayPublicationTitle":"ISSCS 2011 - International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962067/5978636/05978654.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2011.5978654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Support vector machine assisted genetic programming for MQAM classification","conferenceDate":"30 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978654/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12181620","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support vector machine assisted genetic programming for MQAM classification","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054499S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962067","isNumber":"5978636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962067","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5978636","articleId":"5978654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5978657,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Androne","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Androne","id":"37945943600"},{"name":"Tudor Palade","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Tudor","lastName":"Palade","id":"37284217300"},{"name":"Emanuel Puschita","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Emanuel","lastName":"Puschita","id":"37297392800"},{"name":"Ancuta Moldovan","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ancuta","lastName":"Moldovan","id":"37543144300"},{"name":"Irina Vermesan","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Irina","lastName":"Vermesan","id":"37547728800"},{"name":"Rebeca Colda","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Rebeca","lastName":"Colda","id":"37546272800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-943-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-944-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-942-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5978657","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"abstract":"The paper is concerned with the study of the co-channel cross-layer interference which appears in evolved mobile networks, in which femtocell access points (FAPs) have been deployed.

However, the price is an increased overhead regarding the control information needed to perform routing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 1 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12181641","htmlLink":"/document/5978679/","conferenceDate":"30 June-1 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparative performance evaluation of IPSAG and HC-IPSAG Cognitive Radio routing protocols","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative performance evaluation of IPSAG and HC-IPSAG Cognitive Radio routing protocols","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116211S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962067","isNumber":"5978636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962067","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5978636","articleId":"5978679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5978680,"authors":[{"name":"Sabit Ekin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sabit","lastName":"Ekin","id":"37398088100"},{"name":"Tarun Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tarun","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37946141600"},{"name":"Khalid A.

Given the ability to use the spectrum in finer granularity such as in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, scheduling seems to be one of the most important functionalities of NGWNs. Therefore, in this study, sub-carrier collisions for especially cell-edge users are investigated along with their impact on air interface capacity for OFDMA-based systems. It is shown that sub-carrier collisions follow hypergeometric distribution with different statistical characteristics. In addition, the air interface capacity of OFDMA systems with the availability of interference is studied as well. Numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis and investigate the impacts of different parameters on both sub-carrier collisions and the air interface capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2011.5978682","publicationTitle":"ISSCS 2011 - International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"ISSCS 2011 - International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962067/5978636/05978682.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2011.5978682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978636","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the statistics of sub-carrier collisions for cell-edge users and air interface capacity in OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the statistics of sub-carrier collisions for cell-edge users and air interface capacity in OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978682/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-1 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12181644","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978682/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the statistics of sub-carrier collisions for cell-edge users and air interface capacity in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05606S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962067","isNumber":"5978636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962067","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5978636","articleId":"5978682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5978700,"authors":[{"name":"I.

We demonstrate by simulations that the new proposed SO-STTCs outperform the best corresponding STTCs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QPSK super-orthogonal space-time trellis codes with 3 and 4 transmit antennas","publicationTitle":"ISSCS 2011 - International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2011.5978758","displayPublicationTitle":"ISSCS 2011 - International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962067/5978636/05978758.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2011.5978758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"QPSK super-orthogonal space-time trellis codes with 3 and 4 transmit antennas","conferenceDate":"30 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978758/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12181703","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QPSK super-orthogonal space-time trellis codes with 3 and 4 transmit antennas","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092994S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5962067","isNumber":"5978636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5962067","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5978636","articleId":"5978758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5978760,"authors":[{"name":"Octavian-Modest Manu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava, Romania"],"firstName":"Octavian-Modest","lastName":"Manu","id":"37945730800"},{"name":"Mihai Dimian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Dimian","id":"37266575600"},{"name":"Ioan Dumitru","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Alexandru Ioan Cuza\uc2a0University, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Dumitru","id":"37319994100"},{"name":"Adrian Graur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava, Romania"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Graur","id":"37394794500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-943-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-944-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-942-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5978760","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Antenna radiation patterns","Phase shifters","Dipole antennas","Phase modulation","Linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","numerical analysis","phase shifters","radiofrequency identification","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array geometrical configuration","beamforming","phased antenna arrays","numerical analysis","antenna radiation pattern","low cost radiofrequency identification","wireless sensor networks applications","RFID","process monitoring","process location","beam steering","linear phase taper","signal fed","array elements","vector modulator","linear phase shifts","phase shift accuracy","phase shift stability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of array geometrical configuration on beamforming in phased antenna arrays and the phase shifter development","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2011.5978760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978636","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"ISSCS 2011 - International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"ISSCS 2011 - International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962067/5978636/05978760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2011.5978760","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978760","abstract":"This paper presents a numerical analysis of radiation pattern and beamforming of various phased antenna arrays configurations with 16 elements having possible use in low cost Radio Frequency Identification and Wireless Sensor Networks applications for process monitoring and location.

The localization of such faults will result in faster fault diagnosis. In this paper an approach for faults in FPGA interconnects is developed called forward tree coding.

With increasing wireless network service providers, users, and applications, there is a need to optimise usage of even parts of the spectrum that are licensed. Dynamic spectrum access is an approach that is designed to enable unlicensed users to make use of licensed parts of the spectrum, opportunistically, when they are idle. To achieve this, user-behaviour modelling, spectrum access algorithms and Cognitive Radio (CR) technology will have to be made use of. In this paper, we propose a distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on the primary-prioritised Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model of interaction between primary and secondary users. A distributed dynamic spectrum access scheme requires that each secondary user be aware of the statistics - arrival and service rates - of the other secondary users, so as to be able to optimise throughput while maintaining fairness. We formulate heuristics that make use of the estimated stationary idle-probability of the spectrum and the interference which each user experiences, to iteratively update user statistics estimates. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm attains an overall throughput that is better than the persistent form of CSMA when the primary user spectrum utilisation is typical (about 45%).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACC.2011.5978889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978855","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978854/5978855/05978889.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Algorithm for Dynamic Spectrum Access Using Primary-Prioritised Markov Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978889/","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Algorithm for Dynamic Spectrum Access Using Primary-Prioritised Markov Model","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12189565","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Algorithm for Dynamic Spectrum Access Using Primary-Prioritised Markov Model","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"pid1096322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061583S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978854","isNumber":"5978855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978854","xplore-issue":"5978855","articleId":"5978889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5978891,"authors":[{"name":"Manthan Shah","affiliation":["Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Manthan","lastName":"Shah","id":"37958938500"},{"name":"Vijay Gaikwad","affiliation":["Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Gaikwad","id":"37948993800"},{"name":"Shashikant Lokhande","affiliation":["Sinhgad College of Engineering, Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Shashikant","lastName":"Lokhande","id":"37958677100"},{"name":"Sanket Borhade","affiliation":["Sinhgad College of Engineering, Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Sanket","lastName":"Borhade","id":"37945955800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-764-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-765-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-763-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5978891","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Discrete wavelet transforms","Fault diagnosis","Continuous wavelet transforms","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","internal combustion engines","mechanical engineering computing","radial basis function networks","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault identification","I.C. engines","artificial neural network","road vehicle engines","engine management system","internal combustion engines","pressure signal feature extraction","discrete wavelet transform","radial basis function network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978891","abstract":"Due to progress in the vehicular technology, vehicles have gradually become a popular form of transportation in people's daily life. The stability and the performance of the vehicles has been the subject of much attraction. Road vehicle engines are controlled by engine management system (EMS) in which fault identification & diagnosis is the vital part. The pressure of the engine intake system always demonstrates the engine condition and affects the volumetric efficiency, fuel consumption and performance of internal combustion engines. Conventional engine diagnostic technology already exists through analyzing the differences between the signals and depends on the experience of the technician. Obviously the conventional detection is not a precise approach for pressure detection when the engine in operating condition. In this paper, a system is consisted of pressure signal feature extraction using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and fault recognition using the neural network technique. To verify the effect of the proposed system for identification, the radial basis function network (RBFN) is used. It has been observed that the training procedure can be accomplished in short time. Also, the conventional flaw of too much reliance on the experience of technicians can be reduced.","doi":"10.1109/PACC.2011.5978891","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACC.2011.5978891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978855","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978854/5978855/05978891.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Identification for I.C.

Recent theoretical work has shown that a class of regenerating codes, which are based on the concept of network coding, can improve the data repair performance over traditional storage schemes such as erasure coding. However, there remain open issues regarding the feasibility of deploying regenerating codes in practical storage systems. We present NCFS, a distributed file system that realizes regenerating codes under real network settings. NCFS transparently stripes data across multiple storage nodes, without requiring the storage nodes to coordinate among themselves. It adopts a layered design that allows extensibility, such that different storage schemes can be readily included into NCFS. We deploy and evaluate our NCFS prototype in different real network settings. In particular, we use NCFS to conduct an empirical study of different storage schemes, including the traditional erasure codes RAID-5 and RAID-6, and a special family of regenerating codes that are based on E-MBR. Our work provides a practical and extensible platform for realizing theories of regenerating codes in distributed file systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISNETCOD.2011.5978919","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Networking Coding","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Networking Coding","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978850/5978908/05978919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNETCOD.2011.5978919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978908","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NCFS: On the Practicality and Extensibility of a Network-Coding-Based Distributed File System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NCFS: On the Practicality and Extensibility of a Network-Coding-Based Distributed File System","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978919/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12180363","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5978919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NCFS: On the Practicality and Extensibility of a Network-Coding-Based Distributed File System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"pid1093194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118004S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978850","isNumber":"5978908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978850","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5978908","articleId":"5978919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5978920,"authors":[{"name":"Anne-Marie Kermarrec","affiliation":["INRIA-Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Anne-Marie","lastName":"Kermarrec","id":"37293819000"},{"name":"Nicolas Le Scouarnec","affiliation":["Technicolor, Inc., Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Le Scouarnec","id":"37546235900"},{"name":"Gilles Straub","affiliation":["Technicolor, Inc., Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Straub","id":"37680512300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-140-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-138-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-139-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-9660"}],"articleNumber":"5978920","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":590},"abstract":"Erasure correcting codes are widely used to ensure data persistence in distributed storage systems. This paper addresses the simultaneous repair of multiple failure in such codes. We go beyond existing work (i.e., regenerating codes by Dimakis et al.) and propose coordinated regenerating codes allowing devices to coordinate during simultaneous repairs thus further reducing the costs. We define optimal coordinated regenerating codes outperforming existing codes for simultaneous repairs with respect to both storage and repair costs. We prove that deliberately delaying repairs does not bring additional gains (i.e., regenerating codes are optimal as long as each failure can be repaired before a second one occurs). Finally, we propose adaptive regenerating codes that self-adapt to the system state and prove they are optimal.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Networking Coding","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978850/5978908/05978920.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Networking Coding","doi":"10.1109/ISNETCOD.2011.5978920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNETCOD.2011.5978920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5978920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repairing Multiple Failures with Coordinated and Adaptive Regenerating Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Redundancy","Performance evaluation","Network coding","Decoding","Delay","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple failures","erasure correcting codes","adaptive regenerating codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5978920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Repairing Multiple Failures with Coordinated and Adaptive Regenerating Codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5978920/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12180364","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repairing Multiple Failures with Coordinated and Adaptive Regenerating Codes","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"pid1093204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078482S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978850","isNumber":"5978908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978850","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5978908","articleId":"5978920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5978928,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This is due to inadequate investments for the system improvement works. This paper presents an efficient optimization method for the optimal capacitor sizing of the radial distribution network in order to reduce the power losses and to improve the voltage profile. The capacitor location is determined by the known sensitivity analysis method.

The ability to automatically identify arrhythmias from ECG recordings is important for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In this paper we proposed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based cardiac arrhythmia disease diagnosis system using standard 12 lead ECG signal recordings data. In this study, we are mainly interested in classifying disease in normal and abnormal classes. We have used UCI ECG signal data to train and test three different ANN models. In arrhythmia analysis, it is unavoidable that some attribute values of a person would be missing. Therefore we have replaced these missing attributes by closest column value of the concern class. ANN models are trained by static backpropagation algorithm with momentum learning rule to diagnose cardiac arrhythmia. The classification performance is evaluated using measures such as mean squared error (MSE), classification specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and area under curve (AUC). Out of three different ANN models Multilayer perceptron ANN model have given very attractive classification results in terms of classification accuracy and sensitivity of 86.67% and 93.75% respectively while Modular ANN have given 93.1% classification specificity.","doi":"10.1109/PACC.2011.5979000","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978854/5978855/05979000.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACC.2011.5979000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Based Cardiac Arrhythmia Disease Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Based Cardiac Arrhythmia Disease Diagnosis","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12189583","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979000/","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network Based Cardiac Arrhythmia Disease Diagnosis","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"pid1097894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078343S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978854","isNumber":"5978855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978854","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5978855","articleId":"5979000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5979005,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Also, a well known problem of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) i.e the occurrence of high peak- to-average power ratio (PAPR) in the time domain signal reduces the efficiency of transmit high power amplifier.In this paper, we propose a closed loop orthogonal frequency division multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmit preprocessing system, where the channel coding method referred as pilot symbol assisted rateless coding (PSAR) is used to mitigate the effects of fading and three PAPR reduction methods are used and the best method to reduce PAPR is chosen. The performance of proposed system is measured in terms of bit error rate (BER) and complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for PAPR. The proposed system achieves about 3 dB improvement in PAPR over the traditional OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/PACC.2011.5979005","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978854/5978855/05979005.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACC.2011.5979005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978855","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Closed Loop OFDM-MIMO Transmit Preprocessing Scheme Using Pilot Symbol Assisted Rateless Codes to Mitigate Fading in Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Closed Loop OFDM-MIMO Transmit Preprocessing Scheme Using Pilot Symbol Assisted Rateless Codes to Mitigate Fading in Rayleigh Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979005/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12180498","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979005/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of a Closed Loop OFDM-MIMO Transmit Preprocessing Scheme Using Pilot Symbol Assisted Rateless Codes to Mitigate Fading in Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"pid1097914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067085S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978854","isNumber":"5978855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978854","xplore-issue":"5978855","articleId":"5979005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5979013,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Scaria","affiliation":["VLSI Design Research Centre-Department of ECE, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita Viswavidyapeetham University, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Scaria","id":"37970363300"},{"name":"D.

Watermarking is the best way to protect digital image against illegal recording and distribution. From the literature survey, it has been affirmed that the frequency domain techniques are more robust than spatial domain techniques. In this paper a singular value decomposition (SVD) based watermarking is executed in wavelet domain. This paper proposes the design and hardware implementation of a fast RGB to YUV converter by standard NTSC conversion and reconstruction formulae using optimal 2-D systolic arrays for matrix multiplication.The scheme have been implemented in Altera Cyclone II FPGA. The hardware implementation of 2D DWT decomposition and IDWT reconstruction were implemented in Xilinx xc3s1000-4fg320. Watermarks inserted in the lowest frequencies (LL subband) are resistant to certain group of attacks, and watermarks embedded in highest frequencies (HH subband) are resistant to another group of attacks. Embedding the same watermark in all 4 blocks, will make it extremely difficult to remove or destroy the watermark from all frequency subbands. The proposed algorithm is less resilient to geometric distortion including rotation, scaling and translation. The hardware implementation watermarking schemes has advantages over the software implementation in terms of high performance, and reliability. A hybrid SVD image watermarking in wavelet domain, will have more robustness.","doi":"10.1109/PACC.2011.5979013","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978854/5978855/05979013.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACC.2011.5979013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978855","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of SVD Based Colour Image Watermarking in Wavelet Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of SVD Based Colour Image Watermarking in Wavelet Domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979013/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12180502","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979013/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of SVD Based Colour Image Watermarking in Wavelet Domain","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"pid1098438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063957S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978854","isNumber":"5978855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978854","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5978855","articleId":"5979013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5979027,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method of multiplicative uncertainty has been employed to model the variations of the transmission line reactances. The design is carried out applying robustness criteria for improving stability and performance. A loop-shaping technique has been employed to select a suitable open-loop transfer function, from which the robust controller function is constructed. The controller is tested for a number of disturbances. The damping provided by the robust controller is compared with a fixed-parameter PID controller, whose gains were calculated through a pole-placement technique. It has been observed that the PID control is ineffective at operating points other than nominal. The robust design has been demonstrated to provide extremely good damping characteristics over a range of operating conditions. Here the H\u221e loop shaping technique is applied to design robust STATCOM controller. The designed robust STATCOM controller is implemented in Single Machine Infinite Bus power system. Simulation results are compared with conventional PID controller and robust H\u221e loop shaping STATCOM controller in a SMIB system to show that the improved and robustness of robust loop shaping STATCOM controller proposed over the conventional PID controller in settling the system operating in same conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979027/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12180512","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power System Damping Improvement by Robust STATCOM Voltage Controller Design Using Loop-Shaping Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power System Damping Improvement by Robust STATCOM Voltage Controller Design Using Loop-Shaping Technique","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"pid1098352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050998S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978854","isNumber":"5978855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978854","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5978855","articleId":"5979027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5979038,"authors":[{"name":"Ajaya Kumar Pani","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India"],"firstName":"Ajaya Kumar","lastName":"Pani","id":"37944309900"},{"name":"Vamsi Vadlamudi","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India"],"firstName":"Vamsi","lastName":"Vadlamudi","id":"37946223700"},{"name":"R.

Most of the segmentation methods are parametric and the results of segmentation depend on the correctness of the estimated parameters. In case of supervised segmentation, a priori knowledge is needed for successful segmentation. So, nonparametric and unsupervised segmentation method is used when a priori information is not available. Kohonen's Self Organizing Maps (SOM), an unsupervised and nonparametric artificial neural network method is used to identify the main features present in the image. Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be applied to the results of SOM for optimal segmentation results. In this paper, the basic SOM, SOM combined with GA and some of the variants of SOM like the Variable Structure SOM (VSSOM), Parameterless SOM (PLSOM) are compared and their performance is evaluated. A new unsupervised, nonparametric method is developed by combining the advantages of VSSOM and PLSOM. The experiments performed on the satellite image shows that the modified PLSOM is efficient and the time taken for the segmentation is less when compared to the other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979059/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12180540","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979059/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image Segmentation Using Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm: A Comparative Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Segmentation Using Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm: A Comparative Analysis","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"pid1098466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103087S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978854","isNumber":"5978855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978854","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5978855","articleId":"5979059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5979076,"authors":[{"name":"Ryutaroh Matsumoto","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Instiutte of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryutaroh","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37272972800"},{"name":"Masahito Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Japan","Centre of Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Masahito","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37533252800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-140-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-138-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-139-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-9660"}],"articleNumber":"5979076","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Encoding","Mutual information","Multiplexing","Information rates","Random variables","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","multiplexing","network coding","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure multiplex network coding","multicasting","information rate loss","source node"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979076","doi":"10.1109/ISNETCOD.2011.5979076","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Networking Coding","abstract":"In the secure network coding for multicasting, there is loss of information rate due to inclusion of random bits at the source node.

In a typical event-triggered implementation, the control signals are kept constant until the violation of a condition on the state of the plant triggers the recomputation of the control signals. The possibility of reducing the number of recomputations, and thus of transmissions, while guaranteeing desired levels of control performance, makes event-triggered control very appealing in the context of sensor/actuator networks. In particular, by reducing the network traffic we also reduce the energy expenditures of battery powered wireless sensor nodes.

A novel method to visualize energy flow by computing streamlines of the Poynting vector has been developed and used to determine the dominant propagation mechanisms within the building. It is found that the propagation mechanisms depend on the level of internal clutter modeled. Including metallic and lossy dielectric clutter in the environment increases attenuation on some propagation paths, thereby altering the dominant mechanisms observed. This causes increases in the sector-averaged path loss and changes the distance-dependency exponents across a floor from 2.2 to 2.7.

Directly comparing sector-averaged path loss from the FDTD simulations with experimental measurements shows an RMS error of 14.4 dB when clutter is ignored. However, this is reduced to 10.5 dB when the clutter is included, suggesting that the effects of clutter should not be neglected when modeling propagation indoors.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2164181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6062567/05979136.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2164181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062567","startPage":"4239","endPage":"4246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Propagation in Multifloor Buildings Using the FDTD Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Propagation in Multifloor Buildings Using the FDTD Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328588","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979136/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Propagation in Multifloor Buildings Using the FDTD Method","sourcePdf":"tap-austin-2164181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093931S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6062567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6062567","articleId":"5979136","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5979139,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Albani","affiliation":["D.I.I., University of Siena, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Albani","id":"37279933800"},{"name":"Agnese Mazzinghi","affiliation":["D.E.T., University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Agnese","lastName":"Mazzinghi","id":"37542747800"},{"name":"Angelo Freni","affiliation":["D.E.T., University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Freni","id":"37298081100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5979139","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":787},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Although slot antennas are usually modeled as perfectly electric conductors, for accurate antenna design and optimization, ohmic loss effects cannot be neglected. This is especially true in millimeter and submillimeter-wave applications, and in low-cost technology for mass production, where highly conductive surfaces are out of budget. This paper presents a rigorous but efficient method-of-moments (MoM) formulation for the analysis of radial line slot array (RLSA) antennas, which includes the finite conductivity of metals. First, by using equivalence and reciprocity theorems, effective magnetic currents are defined on each slot aperture, instead of standard electric and magnetic equivalent currents. This choice halves the number of unknowns of the MoM linear system, still preserving the rigor of the electromagnetic formulation. Next, proper Green's functions accounting for the finite conductivity of metals are derived analytically and used in the MoM admittance matrix expressions. A numerical check of self and mutual admittances for a couple of slots etched in a nonperfectly conducting structure is provided against results from a finite-element method. Finally, a few RLSA realizations are analyzed to investigate the effect of ohmic losses in a practical antenna design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6062567/05979139.pdf","startPage":"4023","endPage":"4032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2164187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2164187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rigorous MoM Analysis of Finite Conductivity Effects in RLSA Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Green's function methods","Moment methods","Metals","Surface impedance","Impedance","Magnetic separation","Conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna theory","conductors (electric)","finite element analysis","Green's function methods","matrix algebra","method of moments","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rigorous MoM analysis","finite conductivity effects","RLSA antennas","slot antennas","perfectly electric conductors","ohmic loss effects","mass production","method-of-moments","radial line slot array antenna analysis","effective magnetic currents","reciprocity theorems","equivalence theorems","magnetic equivalent currents","MoM linear system","electromagnetic formulation","Green's functions","MoM admittance matrix expressions","mutual admittances","nonperfectly conducting structure","finite-element method","antenna design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Green's function","impedance boundary condition","moment methods","radial line slot array (RLSA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rigorous MoM Analysis of Finite Conductivity Effects in RLSA Antennas","volume":"59","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328591","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rigorous MoM Analysis of Finite Conductivity Effects in RLSA Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-freni-2164187-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033477S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6062567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"17","articleId":"5979139","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5979141,"authors":[{"name":"Yazid Yusuf","affiliation":["Antenna, RF and Microwave Integrated (AMRI) System Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida (UCF), Orlando, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6062567/5979141/5979141-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yazid Yusuf (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan, in 2005.

In this paper, we propose a minimum degradation array (MDA) for optimum sensitivity. First, the degradation factor (DF) is defined to characterize the effect of redundant spatial frequency samples formed by an array on the sensitivity. Aiming at minimizing DF, a simulated annealing (SA) based method is proposed to search for an MDA, which, combining with a concept of augmented maximum baseline (CAMB), can effectively locate the true global minimum of DF. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as CAMB in optimizing DF. Further, the lower bound of DF is discussed. Finally, simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method as well as CAMB is of significance in achieving optimum sensitivity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979146/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12328598","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5979146/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Placement of Antenna Elements in Aperture Synthesis Microwave Radiometers for Optimum Radiometric Sensitivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Placement of Antenna Elements in Aperture Synthesis Microwave Radiometers for Optimum Radiometric Sensitivity","sourcePdf":"tap-li-2164172-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121805S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6062567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6062567","articleId":"5979146","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5979151,"authors":[{"name":"Guang-Ding Ge","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Guang-Ding","lastName":"Ge","id":"37531594500"},{"name":"Bing-Zhong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bing-Zhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280506100"},{"name":"Duo Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37857632300"},{"name":"Deshuang Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Deshuang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37535412500"},{"name":"Shuai Ding","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Ding","id":"37531798200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5979151","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":922},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Transmission line measurements","Signal resolution","Antenna arrays","Focusing","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic wave propagation","microstrip resonators","monopole antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subwavelength array","planar monopoles","complementary split rings","far-field time reversal","microstructures","time-reversed electromagnetic wave","antenna array","spatial super-resolution","bit rate 660 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary split ring","planar monopole","subwavelength array","super-resolution","time-reversed electromagnetic wave"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2164190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6062567/05979151.pdf","startPage":"4345","endPage":"4350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2164190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subwavelength Array of Planar Monopoles With Complementary Split Rings Based on Far-Field Time Reversal","abstract":"With the aid of specific microstructures in a subwavelength array, time-reversed electromagnetic wave can display spatial super-resolution focusing in far-field zone.

An important property of this antenna is that if multiple such planar monopoles are placed face to face, the proposed array can perform time-reversal far-field focusing with a spatial super-resolution as small as one twentieth of a wavelength.

For delayed neural networks, most researchers construct a Lyapunov function based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. However, that approach is not intuitive. We provide a alternative candidate Lyapunov function for a delayed neural network. On the other hand, if we are first given a quadratic cost function, we can construct a delayed neural network by suitably dividing the second-order term into two parts: a self-feedback connection weight and a delayed connection weight. To demonstrate the advantage of a variably delayed neural network, we propose a transiently chaotic neural network with variable delay and show numerically that the model should possess a better searching ability than Chen-Aihara's model, Wang's model, and Zhao's model. We discuss both the chaotic and the convergent phases. During the chaotic phase, we simply present bifurcation diagrams for a single neuron with a constant delay and with a variable delay. We show that the variably delayed model possesses the stochastic property and chaotic wandering. During the convergent phase, we not only provide a novel Lyapunov function for neural networks with a delay (the Lyapunov function is independent of the LMI approach) but also establish a correlation between the Lyapunov function for a delayed neural network and an objective function for the traveling salesman problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12270582","pubMedId":"21843986","volume":"22","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5979157/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Chaotic Simulated Annealing by a Neural Network With a Variable Delay: Design and Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic Simulated Annealing by a Neural Network With a Variable Delay: Design and Application","sourcePdf":"tnn-chen-2163080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122744S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6032791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6032791","articleId":"5979157","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":5979158,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng-Guang Wu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6032791/5979158/5979158-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zheng-Guang Wu was born in 1982.

Using different approaches, a large variety of regularization terms have been proposed in literature. While it seems that all of them have so much in common, a general potential function which fits most of them is still missing. In this paper, in order to propose an efficient reconstruction method based on a variational approach and involving a general regularization term (including most of the known potential functions, convex and nonconvex), we deal with i) the definition of such a general potential function, ii) the properties of the associated \u201cproximity operator\u201d (such as the existence of a discontinuity), and iii) the design of an approximate solution of the general \u201cproximity operator\u201d in a simple closed form. We also demonstrate that a special case of the resulting \u201cproximity operator\u201d is a set of shrinkage functions which continuously interpolate between the soft-thresholding and hard-thresholding.

This is especially detrimental in uncompensated links, where an ideal compensator for channel distortions and laser phase noise should first eliminate receive phase noise, then equalize channel distortions, and only later compensate for transmit phase noise. Unfortunately, the simultaneous presence of transmit and receive phase noise makes very difficult to discriminate between them, even in the presence of a pilot tone. Moreover, the picture is different for optical systems using single-carrier or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, where transmit and receive phase noise components may have a different impact. All these aspects are analyzed and discussed in this paper. A novel digital coherence enhancement (DCE) technique, able to significantly reduce the phase noise of transmit or receive lasers by using an interferometric device plus a very simple electronic processing, is also described. The performance of this technique and the statistical properties of the residual phase noise are analytically derived and verified by simulations, showing a high increase of the maximum bit-rate-distance product. The practical implementation of DCE is finally discussed and some alternative implementation schemes are presented.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2164237","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5986810/05979171.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2164237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986810","startPage":"2790","endPage":"2800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Phase Noise and Compensation Techniques in Coherent Optical Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Phase Noise and Compensation Techniques in Coherent Optical Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"18","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"12213561","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979171/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Phase Noise and Compensation Techniques in Coherent Optical Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-secondini-2164237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109273S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5986810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5986810","articleId":"5979171","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5979174,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Caratelli","affiliation":["Microwave Technology and Systems for Radar (MTSR) Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6062567/5979174/5979174-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Diego Caratelli was born in Latina, Italy, on May 2, 1975.

The proposed technique, based on the concept of auxiliary array factor, is aimed at the deterministic determination of the optimal array element density and excitation tapering distributions useful to mimic a desired radiation pattern. In particular, the developed antenna placement method does not require any iterative or stochastic optimization procedure, resulting in a dramatic reduction of antenna design times.

Several scenarios are considered, and the impact of the different propagation characteristics (LOS, NLOS, link-distance, presence of diffuse-scattering, angular distribution of the signal, etc.) on cross-polarization coupling is analyzed. Generally, a fairly high degree of coupling is observed due to multipath propagation and especially to diffuse scattering.

The structural information of an object can be extracted by analyzing the late-time scattered field as the impulse-response of the structure. The late-time scattered field, which represents the source-free response of the structure, contains a summation of damped sinusoids. The frequency and damping factor of these damped sinusoids are uniquely associated with the structural information, and can be used to identify an unknown object. We propose to create uniquely identifiable scattered fields from an object by incorporating \u201cnotches\u201d in the structure giving rise to specific damped sinusoids in the source-free scattered field of the structure. In this manner, data can be embedded into the structure of an object which is detectable using electromagnetic waves, allowing a metallic object to serve as a chipless radio-frequency identification tag (RFID). Data is encoded as complex natural resonant frequencies (referred to as poles) in the structure and is retrieved from the scattered field. Data retrieval is based on Singularity Expansion Method (SEM) analysis using target identification techniques. Each complex-frequency pole provides two-dimensional data (real and imaginary) which can be extracted from the late-time impulse response of the structure using a numerical technique such as the Matrix Pencil Method. We have designed and prototyped a 6-bit (3-pole) tag. The tag is analyzed using simulations and measurements. The tag is successfully read remotely via its scattered fields. The measured data are compared with simulation, and are in close agreement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded Singularity Chipless RFID Tags","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2164191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6062567/05979188.pdf","startPage":"3961","endPage":"3968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2164191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Embedded Singularity Chipless RFID Tags","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5979188/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328620","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded Singularity Chipless RFID Tags","sourcePdf":"tap-manteghi-2164191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067135S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6062567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6062567","articleId":"5979188","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5979196,"authors":[{"name":"Jussi Salmi","affiliation":["SMARADCoE, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Espoo, Finland","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6062567/5979196/5979196-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jussi Salmi (S'05\u2013M'09) was born in Finland in 1981.

The use of multiple antennas at transmitter and receiver (MIMO) allows not only improved reliability, but also better accuracy in localization and tracking of humans and their various types of movement. This paper describes an experimental demonstration of localizing a test subject and tracking his breathing under ideal conditions. The UWB MIMO channel, which includes the test subject as well as other objects, is modeled as a superposition of multipath components (MPCs). From the measured data one can extract the parameters of the MPCs, including their directions and delays, which allows localization of the test subject as well as tracking the breathing motion. Since the breathing pattern of the test subject induces delay variations of the diaphragm-reflected MPC that are much smaller than the Fourier resolution limits, the high-resolution RIMAX algorithm (iterative maximum-likelihood estimation scheme) is employed together with a path detection scheme for determining and tracking the MPC parameters. Furthermore, it is illustrated that with a wideband array model, the requirements for antenna spacing are not as limited as for conventional narrowband array processing. Through controlled experiments with a vector network analyzer and a virtual antenna array observing both an artificial \u201cbreathing\u201d object as well as a human subject, it is shown that one can accurately estimate the small scale movement from human respiratory activity. This is achieved both for line-of-sight between transmitter, receiver, and objects, as well as for non-line-of sight.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6062567/05979196.pdf","startPage":"4257","endPage":"4267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2164214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2164214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Parameter Estimation, Modeling and Measurements for Ultrawideband MIMO Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Arrays","Antenna arrays","Ultra wideband antennas","Humans","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadband antennas","Fourier transforms","MIMO radar","multipath channels","parameter estimation","radar receivers","radar signal processing","radar transmitters","ultra wideband radar","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagation parameter estimation","propagation parameter modeling","propagation parameter measurement","ultrawideband MIMO radar","reliable remote monitoring","multiple antenna","UWB MIMO channel","multipath component","breathing motion tracking","delay variation","diaphragm-reflected MPC","Fourier resolution limit","high-resolution RIMAX algorithm","path detection scheme","wideband array model","antenna spacing","narrowband array processing","vector network analyzer","virtual antenna array","artificial breathing object","human respiratory activity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","multipath channels","parameter estimation","position measurement","propagation measurements","ultrawideband antennas","ultrawideband radar","virtual antenna array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Parameter Estimation, Modeling and Measurements for Ultrawideband MIMO Radar","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5979196/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328626","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Parameter Estimation, Modeling and Measurements for Ultrawideband MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"tap-salmi-2164214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120204S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6062567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6062567","articleId":"5979196","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5979203,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6062567/5979203/5979203-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Wang received the B.S. degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China in 2006, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include computational electromagnetics, especially the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, the FDTD modeling of the entire Earth-ionosphere system, and the earthquake electromagnetics.

The shorted strips are short-circuited through a common shorting strip to the protruded ground and coupled-fed by the T-shape monopole to generate two separate quarter-wavelength loop resonant modes to form a wide lower band to cover the LTE700/GSM850/900 operation (704-960 MHz).

The research has been focusing on design of monitoring and control scheme given the assumptions that the supporting information and communication technology (ICT) systems are capable of providing data and perform control with sufficient quality. A relatively less addressed aspect is the dependency of wide-area monitoring and control (WAMC) systems on their supporting ICT architecture which is usually a compromise between various concerns, such as data quality, interoperability, or security. Without an appropriate ICT architecture design, the projected WAMC system functionalities run the risk of being jeopardized. This paper begins with a presentation about possible delays brought by complex data-transfer and processing processes. Analytical experiments are conducted with purposes to quantify the maximum delay and input signal's sensitivity toward delay on a typical WAMC application where the control of static var compensation (SVC) is coordinated with generator excitations using phasor measurements. Given the characteristics of this particular control scheme, two possible ICT architectures that provide data with different qualities are compared concerning the reliability of this WAMC application. This paper concludes by proposing a generic ICT architecture, enabling efficient WAMC systems implementation in terms of data quality.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2160879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2160879","startPage":"2801","endPage":"2808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/05979216.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICT Architecture Impact on Wide Area Monitoring and Control Systems' Reliability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"ICT Architecture Impact on Wide Area Monitoring and Control Systems' Reliability","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979216/","accessionNumber":"12288228","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979216/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICT Architecture Impact on Wide Area Monitoring and Control Systems' Reliability","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-zhu-2160879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059346S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6029804","articleId":"5979216","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5979353,"authors":[{"name":"Yumei Wu","affiliation":["School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yumei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407308000"},{"name":"Risheng Yang","affiliation":["School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Risheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37961515800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-666-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-667-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-665-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5979353","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software reliability","Data models","Predictive models","Software","Mathematical model","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","neural nets","regression analysis","safety-critical software","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software reliability prediction","GR neural network","safety-critical software","software quality","general regression neural network","GRNN","statistical model","multivariate likelihood equations","probability plot technique","least square fitting","probability distribution functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software reliability","GR neural network","reliability prediction","small size sample"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979353","abstract":"The failures of safety-critical software may result in the serious loss of property and life, thus software reliability has become very demanding. As an important quantitative approach for estimating and predicting software reliability, software reliability prediction technique is significantly useful for improving and ensuring software quality and testing efficiency. A novel software reliability prediction method based on general regression neural network (GRNN) is proposed, which makes it feasible that without constructing a statistical model like classic software reliability models and having difficulties of solving multivariate likelihood equations, this method can be used to predict software failures. It also incorporates test coverage which has increased prediction accuracy. By using probability plot technique and the least square fitting, the probability distribution functions of the original failure data can be determined. And large amount of data can be simulated to make the reliable prediction, which provides a way for solving the inaccuracy problem caused by small size sample of test failure data. A case study has also been done in a real failure data set. The results show that the proposed method can reflect the relationships among the time, test coverage and number of the faults. And it can improve the prediction accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICRMS.2011.5979353","startPage":"688","endPage":"693","publicationTitle":"The Proceedings of 2011 9th International Conference on Reliability, Maintainability and Safety","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRMS.2011.5979353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979226","displayPublicationTitle":"The Proceedings of 2011 9th International Conference on Reliability, Maintainability and Safety","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963915/5979226/05979353.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of software reliability prediction based on GR neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979353/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study of software reliability prediction based on GR neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979353/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12179542","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of software reliability prediction based on GR neural network","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"4thgroupSoftware10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047789S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963915","isNumber":"5979226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963915","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5979226","articleId":"5979353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5979461,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Wang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China","School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37964488200"},{"name":"Biao Ma","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37436903200"},{"name":"Hailing Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hailing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539397600"},{"name":"Man Chen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Man","lastName":"Chen","id":"37579103300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-666-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-667-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-665-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5979461","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":243},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979461","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gears","Planets","Surface morphology","Temperature measurement","Materials","Temperature distribution","Chemicals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fatigue testing","gears","microhardness","power transmission (mechanical)","scanning electron microscopy","wear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wear characteristics","bearing outer ring","planetary gear","conflux planet gear train","power-shift steering transmission","failure mechanism","thrust washer","wear reduction","morphology observation","scanning electron microscopy","metallographic analysis","microhardness testing","fatigue wear"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bearing outer ring","wear failure","axial force","high temperature","lubrication"]}],"abstract":"Aimed at the bearing outer ring of planetary gear in planetary transmission, the failure mechanism of wear between the planet gear bearing and thrust washer was investigated.

Through the comprehensive analysis of metallographic structure and microhardness, the temperature distribution of bearing outer ring was obtained. The results showed that the adhesive wear was the main wear type for thrust washer while the fatigue wear was a small part; a great axial force existed in the working mechanism, which lead to big contact stress and speed up wear; the high temperature on the friction surface could reach about 700\u00b0C and cause the tempering process in the material; Inadequate cooling effect due to lack of lubrication oil may be another main reason for the high temperature caused by wear.","doi":"10.1109/ICRMS.2011.5979461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRMS.2011.5979461","publicationTitle":"The Proceedings of 2011 9th International Conference on Reliability, Maintainability and Safety","displayPublicationTitle":"The Proceedings of 2011 9th International Conference on Reliability, Maintainability and Safety","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963915/5979226/05979461.pdf","startPage":"1252","endPage":"1256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The wear characteristics on bearing outer ring of planetary gear in conflux planet gear train of power-shift steering transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"The wear characteristics on bearing outer ring of planetary gear in conflux planet gear train of power-shift steering transmission","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979461/","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12179650","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979461/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The wear characteristics on bearing outer ring of planetary gear in conflux planet gear train of power-shift steering transmission","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"8thgroupMiscellaneous17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048504S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963915","isNumber":"5979226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963915","xplore-issue":"5979226","articleId":"5979461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5979536,"authors":[{"name":"L.

New forms of locomotion beyond the basic wheel are being explored to overcome this fault. This paper expands on the mechanical design of a previous robot with a high mobility-to-size ratio. To accomplish high mobility the robot uses tumbling as its form of locomotion. By actively involving the body of the robot in the locomotion it can scale larger obstacles and will not get stuck in compliant terrain like similar sized wheeled robots. To accommodate real-world environments the new design has been waterproofed and moreover can be completely submerged in water to operate on a lake or stream floor. Additionally, this robot is equipped with a buoyancy control unit which will allow the robot to either sink or float in water, offering many unique applications in environmental monitoring and surveillance. This paper describes a first generation, radio controlled prototype of the design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Robot sensing systems","Seals","Bladder","Prototypes","Shafts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","marine control","mobile robots","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Aquapod","prototype design","amphibious tumbling robot","mobile robots","rough terrain","mechanical design","high mobility-to-size ratio","wheeled robots","waterproofed design","lake","stream floor","buoyancy control unit","radio controlled prototype"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979538","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979538.pdf","startPage":"4589","endPage":"4594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aquapod: Prototype design of an amphibious tumbling robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Aquapod: Prototype design of an amphibious tumbling robot","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979538/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979538/","accessionNumber":"12288458","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aquapod: Prototype design of an amphibious tumbling robot","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045895S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5979553,"authors":[{"name":"F.

On top of that, a moving robot is also vulnerable to its loud fan noise that changes its orientation relative to the moving limbs where the microphones are mounted on. To tackle the non-stationary ego-motion noise and the direction changes of fan noise, we propose an estimation method based on instantaneous prediction of ego noise using parameterized templates. We verify the ego noise suppression capability of the proposed estimation method on a humanoid robot by evaluating it on two important applications in the framework of robot audition: (1) automatic speech recognition and (2) sound source localization.

describe a novel approach to model-based monocular vehicle tracking out of a moving vehicle using active vision. The designed algorithm can cope with cluttered color images, complex lighting conditions as well as partial occlusion of the leading vehicle and is able to detect and track a vehicle even within unstructured offroad environments. Thanks to the used 3D model which describes the characteristic vehicle geometry and appearance in terms of vertexes, edges and colored surfaces, no special visual markers are required. The knowledge of vehicle's geometry and appearance gained from the model are used within a particle filter to estimate the 6DoF position relative to the ego vehicle, thereby fusing edge as well as color information. We successfully use the proposed algorithm for pure vision based autonomous offroad convoy driving.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979581","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979581.pdf","startPage":"2465","endPage":"2471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monocular model-based 3D vehicle tracking for autonomous vehicles in unstructured environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Monocular model-based 3D vehicle tracking for autonomous vehicles in unstructured environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12288501","htmlLink":"/document/5979581/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monocular model-based 3D vehicle tracking for autonomous vehicles in unstructured environment","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083804S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5979587,"authors":[{"name":"Junqing Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Junqing","lastName":"Wei","id":"37537194000"},{"name":"John M.

Autonomous vehicle decision making is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), then extended to a QMDP framework. Based on MDP/QMDP, three kinds of uncertainties are taken into account: sensor noise, perception constraints and surrounding vehicles' behavior. In simulation, the QMDP-based reasoning framework makes the autonomous vehicle perform with differing levels of conservativeness corresponding to different perception confidence levels. Road tests also indicate that the proposed algorithm helps the vehicle in avoiding potentially unsafe situations under these uncertainties. In general, the results indicate that the proposed QMDP-based algorithm makes autonomous driving more robust to limited sensing ability and occasional sensor failures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Markov processes","Acceleration","Uncertainty","Mathematical model","Predictive models","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","inference mechanisms","Markov processes","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles","road vehicles","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["point-based MDP","point-based Markov decision process algorithm","robust single-lane autonomous driving behavior control","autonomous vehicle decision making","sensor noise","QMDP-based reasoning framework","road tests","QMDP-based algorithm","sensor failure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979587","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979587.pdf","startPage":"2586","endPage":"2592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A point-based MDP for robust single-lane autonomous driving behavior under uncertainties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A point-based MDP for robust single-lane autonomous driving behavior under uncertainties","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979587/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979587/","accessionNumber":"12288507","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A point-based MDP for robust single-lane autonomous driving behavior under uncertainties","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063136S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":5979617,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Wu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37595040200"},{"name":"Wende Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Controls Integration Laboratory, General Motors Company Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Wende","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291405500"},{"name":"B.V.K.

First, because of the benefit that the vanishing point provides knowledge for clear path detection, we apply an example-based method to estimate initial vanishing point candidates. Then, instead of building a pre-trained clear path model over the limited training set, we propose an example-based global image matching method to get an approximate idea of clear path candidate regions, and use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for local image patch modeling to further improve the clear path detection. Finally, we develop an iterative probabilistic refinement to improve performance of both components. Experimental results of real road scenes are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979617","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979617.pdf","startPage":"1615","endPage":"1620","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Example-based clear path detection assisted by vanishing point estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Example-based clear path detection assisted by vanishing point estimation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979617/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12288537","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979617/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Example-based clear path detection assisted by vanishing point estimation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053124S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5979618,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Dominici","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Dominici","id":"37680356600"},{"name":"Rui Cortes\u00e3o","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Cortes\u00e3o","id":"37275934700"},{"name":"Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Sousa","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37536242000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979618","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Surgery","Heart","Physiology","Motion compensation","Computational modeling","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","force control","manipulators","medical robotics","motion control","observers","predictive control","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heart motion compensation","robotic-assisted surgery","beating-heart surgery","physiological motion","force control architecture","WAM arm","linear predictive control","model reference adaptive control","stochastic active observer"]}],"abstract":"In beating-heart surgeries, two natural disturbances affect surgeon's skills: respiration and heartbeats.

Prior 3D-sensor-based work largely classifies individual point cloud segments or uses class-specific trackers. In this paper, we take the approach of classifying the tracks of all visible objects. Our new track classification method, based on a mathematically principled method of combining log odds estimators, is fast enough for real time use, is non-specific to object class, and performs well (98.5% accuracy) on the task of classifying correctly-tracked, well-segmented objects into car, pedestrian, bicyclist, and background classes. We evaluate the classifier's performance using the Stanford Track Collection, a new dataset of about 1.3 million labeled point clouds in about 14,000 tracks recorded from an autonomous vehicle research platform. This dataset, which we make publicly available, contains tracks extracted from about one hour of 360-degree, 10Hz depth information recorded both while driving on busy campus streets and parked at busy intersections.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979636.pdf","startPage":"4034","endPage":"4041","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards 3D object recognition via classification of arbitrary object tracks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Object recognition","Training","Three dimensional displays","Sensors","Image segmentation","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","image classification","image segmentation","mobile robots","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D object recognition","object track classification","autonomous robot","3D-sensor-based work","point cloud segment","class-specific tracker","log odds estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards 3D object recognition via classification of arbitrary object tracks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979636/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12288555","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards 3D object recognition via classification of arbitrary object tracks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073362S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5979643,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Huang","firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Huang","id":"37966355000"},{"name":"David Millman","firstName":"David","lastName":"Millman","id":"37295124600"},{"name":"Morgan Quigley","firstName":"Morgan","lastName":"Quigley","id":"37414807600"},{"name":"David Stavens","firstName":"David","lastName":"Stavens","id":"37547012200"},{"name":"Sebastian Thrun","firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Thrun","id":"37280207800"},{"name":"Alok Aggarwal","firstName":"Alok","lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"37957431800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979643","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":1982},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979643","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Gaussian processes","Reactive power","Computational modeling","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Gaussian processes","SLAM (robots)","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized indoor WiFi GraphSLAM","wireless networks","signal-strength measurements","Gaussian process latent variable models","signature uniqueness assumption","GraphSLAM-like algorithm","signal strength SLAM","laser-SLAM ground truth"]}],"abstract":"The widespread deployment of wireless networks presents an opportunity for localization and mapping using only signal-strength measurements.

During reaching and preshaping, the robot learns to use line manipulation strategies to maneuver the object into a pose at which closing the hand to perform the grasp is more likely to succeed. In contrast, common assumptions in grasp planning and motion planning for reaching are that these tasks can be performed independently, and that the robot has perfect knowledge of the pose of the objects in the environment. We implement our approach using Dynamic Movement Primitives and the probabilistic model-free reinforcement learning algorithm Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n ). The cost function that PI\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n optimizes is a simple boolean that penalizes failed grasps. The key to acquiring robust motion primitives is to sample the actual pose of the object from a distribution that represents the state estimation uncertainty. During learning, the robot will thus optimize the chance of grasping an object from this distribution, rather than at one specific pose. In our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate how the motion primitives become more robust when grasping simple cylindrical objects, as well as more complex, non-convex objects. We also investigate how well the learned motion primitives generalize towards new object positions and other state estimation uncertainty distributions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979644/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979644/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12288563","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning to grasp under uncertainty","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to grasp under uncertainty","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066616S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5979645,"authors":[{"name":"Ryuta Ozawa","affiliation":["Department of Robotics, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuta","lastName":"Ozawa","id":"37273966600"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Chaumette","affiliation":["IRISA, INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Chaumette","id":"37265186700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979645","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":819},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979645","abstract":"This paper presents an image-based visual servoing for controlling the position and orientation of a quadrotor using a fixed downward camera observing landmarks on the level ground.

The vast majority of current visual odometry algorithms are heavily based on geometry, using a calibrated camera model to recover relative translation (up to scale) and rotation by tracking image features over time. Our method eliminates the need for a parametric model by jointly learning how image structure and vehicle dynamics affect camera motion. This is achieved with a Gaussian Process extension, called Coupled GP, which is trained in a supervised manner to infer the underlying function mapping optical flow to relative translation and rotation. Matched image features parameters are used as inputs and linear and angular velocities are the outputs in our non-linear multi-task regression problem. We show here that it is possible, using a single uncalibrated camera and establishing a first-order temporal dependency between frames, to jointly estimate not only a full 6 DoF motion (along with a full covariance matrix) but also relative scale, a non-trivial problem in monocular configurations. Experiments were performed with imagery collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying over a deserted area at speeds of 100-120 km/h and altitudes of 80-100 m, a scenario that constitutes a challenge for traditional visual odometry estimators.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979706.pdf","startPage":"6213","endPage":"6220","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual odometry learning for unmanned aerial vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Training","Cameras","Covariance matrix","Vehicles","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","distance measurement","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual odometry learning","unmanned aerial vehicles","visual information","vehicle motion","machine learning","geometry","calibrated camera model","image features tracking","image structure","vehicle dynamics","camera motion","Gaussian process","coupled GP","function mapping optical flow","nonlinear multitask regression problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Visual odometry learning for unmanned aerial vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979706/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12288624","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual odometry learning for unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086846S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5979707,"authors":[{"name":"Anqi Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Canada"],"firstName":"Anqi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37535026500"},{"name":"Chatavut Viriyasuthee","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Canada"],"firstName":"Chatavut","lastName":"Viriyasuthee","id":"37706727700"},{"name":"Ioannis Rekleitis","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Canada"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Rekleitis","id":"37281356300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979707","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":896},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979707","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Trajectory","Turning","Aircraft","Orbits","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace components","aerospace robotics","aircraft","remotely operated vehicles","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal complete terrain coverage","unmanned aerial vehicle","aerial robotics domain","automated terrain coverage","fixed-wing aircraft"]}],"abstract":"We present the adaptation of an optimal terrain coverage algorithm for the aerial robotics domain.

Currently, the only reliable systems for determining traffic light state information are non-passive proofs of concept, requiring explicit communication between a traffic signal and vehicle. Here, we present a passive camera based pipeline for traffic light state detection, using (imperfect) vehicle localization and assuming prior knowledge of traffic light location. First, we introduce a convenient technique for mapping traffic light locations from recorded video data using tracking, back-projection, and triangulation. In order to achieve robust real-time detection results in a variety of lighting conditions, we combine several probabilistic stages that explicitly account for the corresponding sources of sensor and data uncertainty. In addition, our approach is the first to account for multiple lights per intersection, which yields superior results by probabilistically combining evidence from all available lights. To evaluate the performance of our method, we present several results across a variety of lighting conditions in a real-world environment. The techniques described here have for the first time enabled our autonomous research vehicle to successfully navigate through traffic-light-controlled intersections in real traffic.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979714.pdf","startPage":"5784","endPage":"5791","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic light mapping, localization, and state detection for autonomous vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Vehicles","Lenses","Histograms","Uncertainty","Reliability","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","object detection","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic light mapping","autonomous vehicles","autonomous driving","traffic signal","passive camera","traffic light state detection","vehicle localization","tracking","backprojection","triangulation","robust real-time detection","lighting condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Traffic light mapping, localization, and state detection for autonomous vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979714/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12288632","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic light mapping, localization, and state detection for autonomous vehicles","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071808S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5979741,"authors":[{"name":"Henry de Plinval","affiliation":["ONERA Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"de Plinval","id":"37947120000"},{"name":"Pascal Morin","affiliation":["Inria, Le Chesnay, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Morin","id":"37273701000"},{"name":"Philippe Mouyon","affiliation":["ONERA Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Mouyon","id":"37370264800"},{"name":"Tarek Hamel","affiliation":["Nice-Sophia Antipolis, I3S-CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Hamel","id":"37299810900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979741","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":521},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979741","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Cameras","Transmission line matrix methods","Visualization","Vehicle dynamics","Visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","feedback","gyroscopes","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles","stability","video cameras","visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual servoing","underactuated VTOL UAV","linear homography-based approach","vertical take off and landing underactuated autonomous vehicles","hover flight","on-board video camera","rate gyros","vehicle stability","homography matrix","feedback law stability","explicit stability conditions","control parameter tuning"]}],"abstract":"The paper addresses the control of Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) Underactuated Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) in hover flight, based on measurements provided by an on-board video camera and rate gyros.

By using the homography matrix computed from the camera measurements of the target, stabilizing feedback laws are derived. Explicit stability conditions on the control parameters are provided.

In this paper, a new approach consisting of a number of modular neural networks is proposed to recognize multiple classes of objects for a robotic system. The population of the modular neural networks depends on the class number of the objects to be recognized and each modular network only focuses on learning one object class. For each modular neural network, both the bottom-up (sensory-driven) and top-down (expectation-driven) pathways are fused together, and a supervised learning algorithm is applied to update corresponding weights of both pathways. Furthermore, two different training strategies are evaluated: positive-only training and positive-and-negative training. Experiments on visual image recognition demonstrate the efficiencies of the proposed approach and the corresponding training strategies.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979822","startPage":"2927","endPage":"2932","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979822.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular neural networks for multi-class object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Training","Biological neural networks","Data models","Object recognition","Artificial neural networks","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","intelligent robots","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object recognition","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular neural network","multiclass object recognition","intelligence robot","top-down pathway","bottom-up pathway","supervised learning algorithm","positive-only training","positive-and-negative training","visual image recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modular neural networks for multi-class object recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979822/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12326280","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular neural networks for multi-class object recognition","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07134S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5979823,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Zhou","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37537811200"},{"name":"Peter Hatherly","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Hatherly","id":"37410119900"},{"name":"Fabio Ramos","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Ramos","id":"37285364500"},{"name":"Eric Nettleton","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Nettleton","id":"37324203200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979823","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rocks","Entropy","Data mining","Feature extraction","Geologic measurements","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drilling (geotechnical)","drilling machines","entropy","geology","mining","rocks","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive data driven model","rock property characterization","blast hole drill rig","measurement while drilling data","geology","adaptive unsupervised approach","entropy gradient minimization","optimized adjusted penetration rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979823","abstract":"Autonomous operation of blast hole drill rigs requires monitoring of drilling parameters known as \"Measurement While Drilling\" (MWD) data. From these data, rock properties can be inferred. A supervised classification scheme is usually used to map MWD data inputs to rock type outputs given some labeled training data. However, the geology has no definite ground truth that can allow a reliable labeling of the training data, nor is there a clear input-output pair connection between the MWD data and the rock types. In this paper, an adaptive unsupervised approach is proposed to estimate the rock types in a data driven way by minimizing the entropy gradient of the characterizing measure \"Optimized Adjusted Penetration Rate\" (OAPR). Neither data labeling nor fixed model parameters are required because of the data driven nature of the algorithm. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our solution.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979823","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1915","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979823.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive data driven model for characterizing rock properties from Drilling data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive data driven model for characterizing rock properties from Drilling data","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979823/","accessionNumber":"12326281","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979823/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive data driven model for characterizing rock properties from Drilling data","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074333S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5979830,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Diftler","affiliation":["NASA-Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Diftler","id":"37273996800"},{"name":"J.S.

Upgrades include: increased force sensing, greater range of motion, higher bandwidth, and improved dexterity. R2's integrated mechatronic design results in a more compact and robust distributed control system with a fraction of the wiring of the original Robonaut. Modularity is prevalent throughout the hardware and software along with innovative and layered approaches for sensing and control. The most important aspects of the Robonaut philosophy are clearly present in this latest model's ability to allow comfortable human interaction and in its design to perform significant work using the same hardware and interfaces used by people.

With a normal microphone, the operator has difficulty recognizing the auditory scene of the Texai, e.g., he/she cannot know the number and the locations of sounds. To solve this problem, we design selectable sound separation functions with 8 microphones in two modes, overview and filter modes, and implement them using HARK's sound source localization and separation. The overview mode visualizes the direction-of-arrival of surrounding sounds, while the filter mode provides sounds that originate from the range of directions he/she specifies. The functions enable the operator to be aware of a sound even if it comes from behind the Texai, and to concentrate on a particular sound. The design and implementation was completed in five days due to the portability of HARK. Experimental evaluations with actual and simulated data show that the resulting system localizes sound sources with a tolerance of 5 degrees.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979849/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12326307","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979849/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of selectable sound separation on the Texai telepresence system using HARK","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of selectable sound separation on the Texai telepresence system using HARK","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0678.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061348S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5979850,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Bailey","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Bailey","id":"37432980100"},{"name":"Mitch Bryson","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Mitch","lastName":"Bryson","id":"37295622000"},{"name":"Hua Mu","affiliation":["College of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, China","Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Mu","id":"37074271400"},{"name":"John Vial","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Vial","id":"38274313000"},{"name":"Lachlan McCalman","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Lachlan","lastName":"McCalman","id":"38273327000"},{"name":"Hugh Durrant-Whyte","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Hugh","lastName":"Durrant-Whyte","id":"38277028600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979850","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":790},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Servers","Robot sensing systems","Joints","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","decentralised control","distributed algorithms","Gaussian processes","inertial navigation","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","path planning","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralised cooperative localisation","heterogeneous mobile robot teams","distributed algorithm","joint localisation","heterogeneous sensing capabilities","exteroceptive sensing","information sharing","robot pose estimation","interrobot measurements","optimal minimum mean-squared estimation","redundant decentralisation","information-form Gaussian representation","indoor mobile robots","odometry","inertial sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979850","abstract":"This paper presents a distributed algorithm for performing joint localisation of a team of robots.

Inter-robot range-bearing measurements provide the mechanism for transferring pose information from well-localised vehicles to those less capable. In our proposed formulation, high frequency egocentric data (e.g., odometry, IMU, GPS) is fused locally on each platform. This is the distributed part of the algorithm. Inter-robot measurements, and accompanying state estimates, are communicated to a central server, which generates an optimal minimum mean-squared estimate of all robot poses. This server is easily duplicated for full redundant decentralisation. Communication and computation are efficient due to the sparseness properties of the information-form Gaussian representation. A team of three indoor mobile robots equipped with lasers, odometry and inertial sensing provides experimental verification of the algorithms effectiveness in combining location information.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979850","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979850.pdf","startPage":"2859","endPage":"2865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralised cooperative localisation for heterogeneous teams of mobile robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decentralised cooperative localisation for heterogeneous teams of mobile robots","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12326308","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979850/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979850/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralised cooperative localisation for heterogeneous teams of mobile robots","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085699S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5979862,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Dietrich","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Dietrich","id":"37970388100"},{"name":"Thomas Wimb\u00f6ck","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Wimb\u00f6ck","id":"37295427200"},{"name":"Holger T\u00e4ubig","affiliation":["German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Bremen"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"T\u00e4ubig","id":"38230618300"},{"name":"Alin Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","id":"38270361100"},{"name":"Gerd Hirzinger","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Hirzinger","id":"37279677100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979862","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":643},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Damping","Force","Torque","Collision avoidance","Manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","humanoid robots","manipulators","mobile robots","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reactive self-collision avoidance","torque controlled humanoids","position controlled humanoids","robotic systems","artificial repulsion potential fields","torque controlled manipulators","position controlled manipulators","emergency brake strategy","kinetic energy considerations","Justin"]}],"abstract":"One of the fundamental demands on robotic systems is a safe interaction with their environment. For fulfilling that condition, both collisions with obstacles and the own structure have to be avoided. We address the problem of self collisions and propose an algorithm for its avoidance which is based on artificial repulsion potential fields and applicable to both torque and position controlled manipulators. To this end, we design a damping that incorporates the configuration dependance of the robot. For a maximum level of safety, an additional emergency brake strategy based on kinetic energy considerations is introduced for situations in which self collisions are not avoidable by the controller.

The locomotion mechanism of eQuad is a novel eccentric paddle mechanism (ePaddle) that can perform wheeled, legged and paddling actions in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. We first introduce five terrestrial and aquatic gaits. A duty factor of up to 1.0 can be achieved for the legged walking. Therefore, the proposed robot eQuad can walk with a unique gait by eliminating the swing phase of the legs, and it has a large stable margin because all its legs are in contact with ground during walking. Kinematic models of this robot suggest that with this unique gait the reconfigurable ePaddle mechanism has the potential to achieve both legged and wheeled locomotion with the aid of a simple controller. A decoupled controller adapted from the wheeled robot is then built to evaluate this idea. Finally, simulations are performed to verify our proposed decoupled control and gait sequence planning methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979886/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12326343","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled kinematic control of terrestrial locomotion for an ePaddle-based reconfigurable amphibious robot","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled kinematic control of terrestrial locomotion for an ePaddle-based reconfigurable amphibious robot","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056878S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5979915,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Laffranchi","affiliation":["Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Laffranchi","id":"37528362900"},{"name":"Nikos Tsagarakis","affiliation":["Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Tsagarakis","id":"37295830800"},{"name":"D.G.

Compared to the other existing compliant linear or rotary actuators the proposed CompAct unit has the ability to regulate the oscillations induced by the introduction of the compliance by means of a variable physical damping actuator (VPDA) unit. Apart from facilitating the control the VPDA unit can assist in managing the energy transfer from/to the compliant module. The mechatronics, model and control scheme of the CompAct are analysed.

However for most of these actuators in case of a variable frequency motion, it is not energetically beneficial to exploit the natural dynamics in the real time due to the considerably high amount of energy needed to change the stiffness. AwAS (Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness) achieves the stiffness regulation not through the control of the spring pretension (as in most of the existing variable stiffness joints) but by controlling the location of the spring elements. An important consequence of this mechanism is that the displacement needed to change the stiffness is perpendicular to the forces generated by the springs which in turn helps to minimize the energy/power required to regulate the stiffness. It is experimentally shown that AwAS is capable of minimizing energy consumption through exploiting the natural dynamics in real time for both fixed and variable frequency motions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979979.pdf","startPage":"4632","endPage":"4637","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting natural dynamics for energy minimization using an Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Energy consumption","Trajectory","Springs","Time frequency analysis","Joints","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","industrial robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy minimization","adaptable compliance actuators","energy consumption","actuator with adjustable stiffness","AwAS","industrial robots"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting natural dynamics for energy minimization using an Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5979979/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12326434","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting natural dynamics for energy minimization using an Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS)","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0992.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062469S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5979990,"authors":[{"name":"Xiong Xu","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiong Xu","id":"37087429626"},{"name":"Xinjun Sheng","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xinjun Sheng","id":"37087441057"},{"name":"Zhenhua Xiong","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Zhenhua Xiong","id":"37087419077"},{"name":"Xiangyang Zhu","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiangyang Zhu","id":"37087304937"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5979990","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979990","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer numerical control","Delay","Servomotors","Estimation","Interpolation","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised numerical control","DC motors","delays","networked control systems","sampling methods","servomotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time stamped cross-coupled control algorithm","asynchronous sampling","network induced delays","networked computer numerical control machine","controller node","contour error estimation","networked CNC simulation system","TrueTime toolbox","TSCCC algorithm","DC servomotors"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a time-stamped cross-coupled control (TSCCC) algorithm to deal with the asynchronous sampling and network-induced delays in networked computer numerical control (CNC) machines.

The first motor controls the equilibrium position while the second motor regulates the compliance. This paper describes the design and development of AwAS-II which is an improved version of the original realization. AwAS tuned the stiffness by controlling the location of the springs and adjusting its arm, length. Instead AwAS-II regulates the compliance by implementing a force amplifier based on a lever mechanism on which a pivot point can adjust the force amplification ratio from zero to infinitive. As in the first implementation, the actuator which is responsible for adjusting the stiffness in AwAS II is not working against the spring forces. Its displacement is perpendicular to the force generated by springs which makes changing the stiffness energetically efficient. As the force amplification ratio can theoretically change from zero to infinitive consequently the level of stiffness can tune from very soft to completely rigid. Because this range does not depends on the spring's rate and length of the lever, thus soft springs and small lever can be used which result in a lighter and more compact setup. Furthermore as the lever arm is shorter the time required for the stiffness regulation is smaller.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979994","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05979994.pdf","startPage":"4638","endPage":"4643","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AwAS-II: A new Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness based on the novel principle of adaptable pivot point and variable lever ratio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"AwAS-II: A new Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness based on the novel principle of adaptable pivot point and variable lever ratio","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5979994/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12326448","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5979994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AwAS-II: A new Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness based on the novel principle of adaptable pivot point and variable lever ratio","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053621S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5979994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"}]
