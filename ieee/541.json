The latter have been more widespread in recent years because of its lower cost and high efficiency. However, they are highly dependent on the selected electronic components, they have limited flexibility once assembled and they are customized to fit a specific scanner's geometry. Timestamp based systems are gathering more attention lately, especially with high channel count fully digital systems. These new systems must however cope with important singles count rates. One option is to record every detected event and postpone coincidence detection offline. For daily use systems, a real time engine is preferable because it dramatically reduces data volume and hence image preprocessing time and raw data management. This paper presents the timestamp based coincidence engine for the LabPET\u00bf, a small animal PET scanner with up to 4608 individual readout avalanche photodiode channels. The engine can handle up to 100 million single events per second and has extensive flexibility because it resides in programmable logic devices. It can be adapted for any detector geometry or channel count, can be ported to newer, faster programmable devices and can have extra modules added to take advantage of scanner-specific features. Finally, the user can select between full processing mode for imaging protocols and minimum processing mode to study different approaches for coincidence detection with offline software.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2038055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5409972/05410000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2038055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409972","startPage":"117","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real Time Coincidence Detection Engine for High Count Rate Timestamp Based PET","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real Time Coincidence Detection Engine for High Count Rate Timestamp Based PET","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11105694","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5410000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real Time Coincidence Detection Engine for High Count Rate Timestamp Based PET","sourcePdf":"tns-mttrault-2038055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073383S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5409972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5409972","articleId":"5410000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5410018,"authors":[{"name":"Farokh Irom","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Farokh","lastName":"Irom","id":"37283251500"},{"name":"Duc N.

The optimal filter (OF) algorithm reconstructs pulse amplitude and time by two weighted sums, making it compatible with real-time implementation. The filters are usually optimized for stationary noise. We developed and tested a method to optimize the filters for the nonstationary noise of scintillation pulses. It is based on offline statistical analysis of coincident waveforms that could be applied during the system initialization phase. Experimental tests were done on a coincidence setup with two detection blocks composed of a fast inorganic scintillator ( LaBr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n or LYSO) coupled to a photodetector (APD or PMT), preamplifiers and prefilters. The signals were sampled at high rate (250 MHz for APDs, 5 GHz for PMTs) and treated offline. The optimization of the filter coefficients for nonstationary noise yielded a significant improvement compared to those optimized for stationary noise, resp. 368 ps and 632 ps fwhm in coincidence for the LYSO-PMT setup. However, little improvement was achieved compared to leading-edge (DLED) and constant fraction (DCFD) discriminator algorithms (resp. 419 ps, 435 ps fwhm). Indeed, the adjustment of thresholds can be interpreted as an optimization for nonstationary noise. Yet, OF is more robust to white noise than DLED or DCFD. The applicability to PET is discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Positron emission tomography","Sampling methods","Signal sampling","Testing","Signal processing","Optimization methods","Statistical analysis","Solid scintillation detectors","Photodetectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical signal processing","photodetectors","positron emission tomography","preamplifiers","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal filter based algorithm","PET detectors","digital sampling front-end","nonstationary noise","scintillation pulses","offline statistical analysis","coincident waveforms","fast inorganic scintillator","photodetector","preamplifiers","prefilters","white noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital sampling front-end","optimal filtering","parameter estimation","Time Of Flight (TOF) PET","timing algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2031871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5409972/05410025.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2031871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimal Filter Based Algorithm for PET Detectors With Digital Sampling Front-End","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Optimal Filter Based Algorithm for PET Detectors With Digital Sampling Front-End","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410025/","volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410025/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11105702","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimal Filter Based Algorithm for PET Detectors With Digital Sampling Front-End","sourcePdf":"tns-joly-2031871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083323S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5409972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5409972","articleId":"5410025","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5410029,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To a certain extent it is related to the concept of source separation, with the human ability of focusing on a specific source in order to extract relevant information. In this paper, we propose a new approach for the estimation and extraction of the main melody (and in particular the leading vocal part) from polyphonic audio signals. To that aim, we propose a new signal model where the leading vocal part is explicitly represented by a specific source/filter model. The proposed representation is investigated in the framework of two statistical models: a Gaussian Scaled Mixture Model (GSMM) and an extended Instantaneous Mixture Model (IMM). For both models, the estimation of the different parameters is done within a maximum-likelihood framework adapted from single-channel source separation techniques. The desired sequence of fundamental frequencies is then inferred from the estimated parameters. The results obtained in a recent evaluation campaign (MIREX08) show that the proposed approaches are very promising and reach state-of-the-art performances on all test sets.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2041114","startPage":"564","endPage":"575","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5410050/05410055.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2041114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source/Filter Model for Unsupervised Main Melody Extraction From Polyphonic Audio Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Data mining","Humans","Source separation","Frequency estimation","Audio recording","Maximum likelihood estimation","Parameter estimation","Performance evaluation","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","filtering theory","Gaussian processes","maximum likelihood estimation","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source/filter model","unsupervised main melody extraction","polyphonic audio signals","polyphonic music recording","signal model","statistical model","Gaussian scaled mixture model","extended instantaneous mixture model","maximum-likelihood framework","single-channel source separation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind audio source separation","Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM) algorithm","Gaussian scaled mixture model (GSMM)","main melody extraction","maximum likelihood","music","non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)","source/filter model","spectral analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410055/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Source/Filter Model for Unsupervised Main Melody Extraction From Polyphonic Audio Signals","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5410055/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105657","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source/Filter Model for Unsupervised Main Melody Extraction From Polyphonic Audio Signals","sourcePdf":"tasl-durrieu-2041114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099725S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5410050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5410050","articleId":"5410055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":5410057,"authors":[{"name":"Hiromasa Fujihara","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan","Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5410050/5410057/5410057-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiromasa Fujihara received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Because singing voices play an important role in musical pieces with vocals, such representation is useful for music information retrieval systems. The main problem in modeling the characteristics of a singing voice is the negative influences caused by accompaniment sounds. To solve this problem, we developed two methods, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">accompaniment sound reduction and reliable frame selection</i>\n \n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">.</b>\n The former makes it possible to calculate feature vectors that represent a spectral envelope of a singing voice after reducing accompaniment sounds. It first extracts the harmonic components of the predominant melody from sound mixtures and then resynthesizes the melody by using a sinusoidal model driven by these components. The latter method then estimates the reliability of frame of the obtained melody (i.e., the influence of accompaniment sound) by using two Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for vocal and nonvocal frames to select the reliable vocal portions of musical pieces. Finally, each song is represented by its GMM consisting of the reliable frames. This new representation of the singing voice is demonstrated to improve the performance of an automatic singer identification system and to achieve an MIR system based on vocal timbre similarity.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2041386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"638","endPage":"648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2041386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410050","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5410050/05410057.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Music information retrieval","Instruments","Timbre","Multiple signal classification","Signal processing","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["singer identification","vocal-timbre-similarity-based music information retrieval","polyphonic musical audio signals","musical instruments","accompaniment sound reduction","frame selection reliability","predominant melody","Gaussian mixture models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Music information retrieval (MIR)","singer identification","singing voice","vocal","vocal timbre similarity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Modeling of Singing Voice Robust to Accompaniment Sounds and Its Application to Singer Identification and Vocal-Timbre-Similarity-Based Music Information Retrieval","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410057/","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5410057/","accessionNumber":"11105658","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modeling of Singing Voice Robust to Accompaniment Sounds and Its Application to Singer Identification and Vocal-Timbre-Similarity-Based Music Information Retrieval","sourcePdf":"tasl-fujihara-2041386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076103S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5410050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5410050","articleId":"5410057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5410152,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper we attempt to classify EEG data used in the BCI competition by the combination of pattern classification methods. We use common spatial pattern (CSP) to extract features. A genetic algorithm (GA) was applied first to evolve an artificial neural network (ANN) to find the optimum structure of ANN. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) was also attempted to determine the optimal number of hidden neurons complementary to the GA approach.

As a typical multimedia technique, compression on digital images and videos plays an important role in data compression. Some lossy image compression methods are acceptable for achieving a substantial reduction in bit rate, with minor information loss. From the point of view of compression, wavelet transform has emerged as a dominant technology in the fields of signal and image processing, such as the discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packet decomposition. However, a regular transform is limited by its wavelet bases which downsize by a power of two towards the low frequencies, thus it may not produce best results. Being a stochastic population based evolutionary algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) simulates social optimization, where the swarm is modeled by particles in multidimensional space together with a position and a velocity. In this case, it has been proposed to enhance the quality of the wavelet based image compression. Objective measures are also presented to evaluate the integration of the wavelet expansion technologies and PSO optimization scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410174","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373585/5410144/05410174.pdf","startPage":"2287","endPage":"2292","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital image wavelet compression enhancement via particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Digital image wavelet compression enhancement via particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11107419","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5410174/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital image wavelet compression enhancement via particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"0050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058649S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373585","isNumber":"5410144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373585","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5410144","articleId":"5410174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5410177,"authors":[{"name":"Juri Belikov","affiliation":["Institute of Cybernetics, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Juri","lastName":"Belikov","id":"37396469800"},{"name":"Eduard Petlenkov","affiliation":["Department of Computer Control, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Petlenkov","id":"37296756400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4707-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"5410177","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear feedback control systems","Nonlinear control systems","MIMO","Output feedback","Control system synthesis","Closed loop systems","Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Automatic control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","learning (artificial intelligence)","MIMO systems","model reference adaptive control systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model reference control","nonlinear MIMO system","dynamic output feedback linearization algorithm","multi-input multi-output system","additive nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model","neural network training","connectivity structure","linear discrete time reference model","transfer matrix","zeros and poles","linear closed loop system"]}],"abstract":"A dynamic output feedback linearization algorithm for a model reference control of nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems identified by an Additive Nonlinear Autoregressive eXogenous (ANARX) model is introduced.

The purpose of our study is to develop an adaptive impedance force control strategy based on dynamic recurrent fuzzy neural network to maintain the stability of the rehabilitation robot system in the case when the patient's physical condition makes a change. An on-line identification method was used to estimate impaired limb's mechanical impedance parameters. By using dynamic recurrent fuzzy neural network, desired impedance control parameters between rehabilitation robotic end-effector and upper-limb were regulated through on-line learning according to the estimated impaired limb's mechanical impedance parameters. Analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm is much more stable and smooth than other impedance control methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410286/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410286/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107427","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive impedance control based on dynamic recurrent fuzzy neural network for upper-limb rehabilitation robot","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive impedance control based on dynamic recurrent fuzzy neural network for upper-limb rehabilitation robot","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"0237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042981S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373585","isNumber":"5410144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373585","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5410144","articleId":"5410286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5410347,"authors":[{"name":"Lianzhong Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, China"],"firstName":"Lianzhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293114300"},{"name":"Chunfang Li","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, China"],"firstName":"Chunfang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085857712"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4707-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"5410347","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Graph theory","Uncertainty","Pattern classification","Middleware","Switches","Automatic control","Automation","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commerce","fault tolerant computing","neural nets","probability","software development management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business-oriented fault localization algorithm","transitive closure fault propagation model","probability neural networks","fault diagnosis","software business propagation model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410347","abstract":"Analyzed here is a business-oriented fault localization algorithm based on transitive closure fault propagation model and probability neural networks (PNN). Business-oriented fault localization is to construct a fault propagation model for each large complex software business. This strategy focuses on availability of key business other than scattered fault information. Because of the complex dependent relations between software, hardware, and middleware, fault of one component may propagate into correlated components and produce multiple alarms (symptoms). Transitive closure is possible symptoms domain of faults. Fault diagnosis can be transformed into a classification problem. In practice, PNN is often an excellent pattern classifier, outperforming other classifiers including back propagation (BP). It trains quickly since the training is done in one pass of each training vector, rather than several iterations. In our fault localization algorithm FLPNN, conditional probability of symptom is used as weight of hidden layer, and probability of fault is used as weight of output layer. Input of FLPNN is binary vector which represents the occurrence of symptom or not. In order to adapt the change of fault pattern, incremental learning algorithm of DFLPNN is also investigated. The simulation results show the validity and efficiency of FLPNN compared with MCA+ under lost and spurious symptom circumstances.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410347","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1329","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410144","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373585/5410144/05410347.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Business-oriented fault localization based on probabilistic neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410347/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Business-oriented fault localization based on probabilistic neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410347/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11136927","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Business-oriented fault localization based on probabilistic neural networks","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"0306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057324S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373585","isNumber":"5410144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373585","xplore-issue":"5410144","articleId":"5410347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5410348,"authors":[{"name":"Adriano A.

This work intends to exploit the current available resources in commercial FPGAs to implement servo control for hard disk drive system. Simulation and experimental results included in this paper show the viability of exploiting the parallelism and modularity of a low cost FPGA to implement a high sampling rate neural network-based controller.

In chemi-thermo mechanical pulping (CTMP), the non-uniformity in the chemical treatment and the changes in the refiner's energy consumption often cause variations in pulp properties. The CTMP process has strong interactions between process variables and therefore necessitates decoupling of interactions in the refining control system. Together with the high variability in the process dynamics, lack of direct and reliable measurements makes it difficult to control the process. Consistency of the blow-line pulp is not always measured using an on-line sensor. If high consistency sensors are used, also redundant measurements or soft sensors may need to be developed for feedback control purposes. Pulp quality variables such as freeness and shive content are often analyzed infrequently and/or there is a long dead time and time constant between the refiner's blow line and the on-line analyzer's sensor. In this paper, pulp properties of CTMP refining are modeled and a new two-level quality control system is proposed. The nonlinear quality models are verified by simulation and compared with measurements from an existing on-line pulp quality analyzer. The two-level quality control system uses the process models for stabilizing the refiner conditions (pulp consistency and specific energy consumption) and for optimizing the process operation and the pulp quality (freeness). The stabilizing controllers are designed using multivariable Hammerstein and cascade control structures. The optimizing controller calculates the setpoint for the stabilizing controller by using the inverse of the nonlinear multivariable quality model. A simple scheme for adapting the freeness model based on the on-line measurements is presented. The performance of the control system is illustrated in simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410443","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1271","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373585/5410144/05410443.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refiner quality control in a CTMP plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Refiner quality control in a CTMP plant","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410443/","accessionNumber":"11107547","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410443/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refiner quality control in a CTMP plant","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"0404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097779S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373585","isNumber":"5410144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373585","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5410144","articleId":"5410443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5410473,"authors":[{"name":"Adil Kenzi","affiliation":["SI2M laboratory, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Adil","lastName":"Kenzi","id":"37320420800"},{"name":"Bouchra El Asri","affiliation":["SI2M laboratory, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Bouchra El","lastName":"Asri","id":"37320420200"},{"name":"Mahmoud Nassar","affiliation":["SI2M laboratory, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Nassar","id":"37320392100"},{"name":"Abdelaziz Kriouile","affiliation":["SI2M laboratory, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Abdelaziz","lastName":"Kriouile","id":"37320386900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5300-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-2871"}],"articleNumber":"5410473","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"abstract":"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an emerging architectural style for the development of interoperable, agile, large scale and distributed software systems.

The proposed MDD approach consists of (1) a Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile to graphically model adaptable service oriented systems regardless of standards and implementation platforms. The key element of the proposed profile is the multiview service defined as a first class modeling entity that allows the representation of the needs and requirements of users by separating their concerns early in the development lifecycle of service oriented systems (2) an MDD tool that accepts a UML model defined with the proposed profile and transforms it to Java code which constitutes the implementation of each service according to the J2EE platform.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Collision mitigation","Model driven engineering","Resource management","Laboratories","Computer architecture","Service oriented architecture","Large-scale systems","Software systems","Java"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale systems","open systems","software architecture","software prototyping","Unified Modeling Language","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service oriented architecture","interoperable","agile large scale systems","model-driven engineering approach","adaptable service oriented systems","Unified Modeling Language","multiview service","first class modeling entity","UML","Java code","J2EE platform","distributed software systems","development lifecycle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UML profile","Automatic code generation","Model Driven Development","Adaptability","Service modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SOCA.2009.5410473","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375734/5410249/05410473.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCA.2009.5410473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Engineering adaptable service oriented systems: A model driven approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Engineering adaptable service oriented systems: A model driven approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410473/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410473/","accessionNumber":"11137038","conferenceDate":"14-15 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Jan. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Engineering adaptable service oriented systems: A model driven approach","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08172S","chronDate":"14-15 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375734","isNumber":"5410249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375734","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5410249","articleId":"5410473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5410475,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Luo","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Luo","id":"37404669700"},{"name":"Yinghui Pan","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","School of Information Technology, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Yinghui","lastName":"Pan","id":"37401472200"},{"name":"Liang Tan","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Tan","id":"37404436600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4707-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"5410475","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410475","abstract":"In order to enhance the practicality of digital watermarking, watermark perceptibility and robustness must be ensured.

The method is verified with a simulation program developed on Matlab and the results show that the convergence speed and the prediction precision are both improved with satisfactorily.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410509","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1369","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410144","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373585/5410144/05410509.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Price forecasting algorithm for coal and electricity based on PSO and RBF neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410509/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Price forecasting algorithm for coal and electricity based on PSO and RBF neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410509/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11107607","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Price forecasting algorithm for coal and electricity based on PSO and RBF neural network","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"0192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100411S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373585","isNumber":"5410144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373585","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5410144","articleId":"5410509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":5410595,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering and Fuel Cell Center, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rong-Jong","lastName":"Wai","id":"37271527600"},{"name":"Chia-Ming Liu","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406613400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4707-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"5410595","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410595","abstract":"This study focuses on the design of a dynamic Petri recurrent-fuzzy-neural-network (DPRFNN), and this network structure is applied to the path tracking control of a nonholonomic mobile robot for verifying its validity. In the DPRFNN, the concept of a Petri net (PN) with dynamic threshold value and the recurrent frame of internal feedback loops are incorporated into a traditional fuzzy neural network (FNN) to alleviate the computation burden of parameter learning and to enhance the dynamic mapping of network ability. Moreover, the supervised gradient descent method is used to develop the online training algorithm for the DPRFNN control. In order to guarantee the convergence of path tracking errors, analytical methods based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function are proposed to determine varied learning rates for DPRFNN. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed DPRFNN control scheme under different moving paths is verified by experimental results, and its superiority is indicated in comparison with FNN, recurrent FNN (RFNN), Petri FNN (PFNN) and Petri RFNN (PRFNN) control systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410595","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1364","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373585/5410144/05410595.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental verification of dynamic Petri recurrent-fuzzy-neural-network path tracking control design for mobile robot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control design","Mobile robots","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Feedback loop","Computer networks","Convergence","Error analysis","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","position control","recurrent neural nets","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic Petri recurrent-fuzzy-neural-network","path tracking control design","dynamic threshold value","internal feedback loops","supervised gradient descent method","discrete-type Lyapunov function","nonholonomic mobile robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Experimental verification of dynamic Petri recurrent-fuzzy-neural-network path tracking control design for mobile robot","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410595/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107383","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental verification of dynamic Petri recurrent-fuzzy-neural-network path tracking control design for mobile robot","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"0105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076947S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373585","isNumber":"5410144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373585","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5410144","articleId":"5410595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5410597,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwen Yan","affiliation":["Advanced Control Systems Laboratory, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingwen","lastName":"Yan","id":"37407425000"},{"name":"Zhongsheng Hou","affiliation":["Advanced Control Systems Laboratory, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongsheng","lastName":"Hou","id":"37279945500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4707-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"5410597","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Automatic control","Trajectory","Coordinate measuring machines","Control systems","Automation","Error correction","Feedback","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","metering","road traffic","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative learning control based ramp metering","internal model","freeway ramp metering","iteration-varying densities"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410597","abstract":"In this work, we focus on tracking iteration-varying densities, which are described by an internal model between two consecutive iterations, with iterative learning control (ILC) based ramp metering.

The most recent solution involves a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) framework to approximate non-Gaussian output probability density function (PDF). The dynamic weights of such neural network are controlled within each batch of ILC, using a dedicated adaptive controller. Then, between adjacent batches, an iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm is applied to tune RBFNN centres and widths. The most practical ILC-based SDC applications use sum of squared PDF tracking errors (calculated within each batch of ILC) to tune RBFNN parameters through so called P-type ILC laws. This paper first analyses the practical disadvantages of P-type ILC laws to use in SDC applications which include robustness, sensitivity, and operational problems. Then, based on the gradients of squared PDF tracking errors (calculated within batches), it develops a new ILC-based non-Gaussian stochastic control. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed gradient descent optimisation method for non-Gaussian stochastic distribution control.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410612","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1139","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373585/5410144/05410612.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient descent optimisation for ILC-based stochastic distribution control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Control systems","Radial basis function networks","Probability density function","Neural networks","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Iterative algorithms","Robustness","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","gradient methods","learning systems","neurocontrollers","optimisation","radial basis function networks","statistical distributions","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient descent optimisation","ILC-based stochastic distribution control","nonGaussian system","radial basis function neural network","probability density function","adaptive controller","iterative learning control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stochastic Distribution Control","non-Gaussian stochastic systems","Iterative Learning Control","gradient descent optimisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Gradient descent optimisation for ILC-based stochastic distribution control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410612/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11107394","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient descent optimisation for ILC-based stochastic distribution control","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"0577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156846S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373585","isNumber":"5410144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373585","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5410144","articleId":"5410612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5410700,"authors":[{"name":"Neal Leavitt","affiliation":["Leavitt Communications, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Neal Leavitt is president of Leavitt Communications (www.leavcom.com)."]},"firstName":"Neal","lastName":"Leavitt","id":"37284031700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9162"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0814"}],"articleNumber":"5410700","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":12549},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"Many organizations collect vast amounts of customer, scientific, sales, and other data for future analysis. Traditionally, most of these organizations have stored structured data in relational databases for subsequent access and analysis. However, a growing number of developers and users have begun turning to various types of nonrelational, now frequently called NoSQL-databases. Nonrelational databases, including hierarchical, graph, and object-oriented databases-have been around since the late 1960s. However, new types of NoSQL databases are being developed. And only now are they beginning to gain market traction. Different NoSQL databases take different approaches. What they have in common is that they're not relational. Their primary advantage is that, unlike relational databases, they handle unstructured data such as word-processing files, e-mail, multimedia, and social media efficiently. This paper discuss issues such as limitations, advantages, concerns and doubts regarding NoSQL databases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relational databases","Object oriented databases","Marketing and sales","Data analysis","Turning","Electronic mail","Multimedia databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relational databases","SQL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NoSQL database","nonrelational database","structured data storage","object oriented database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Databases","NoSQL databases"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MC.2010.58","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/5410692/05410700.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2010.58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Will NoSQL Databases Live Up to Their Promise?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Will NoSQL Databases Live Up to Their Promise?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410700/","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410700/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11136134","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Will NoSQL Databases Live Up to Their Promise?","sourcePdf":"mco2010020012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023112S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2","isNumber":"5410692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5410692","articleId":"5410700","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5410708,"authors":[{"name":"Rama Chellappa","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rama Chellappa is a Minta Martin Professor of Engineering, professor of electrical and computer engineering, and an affiliate professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park.

The detector is built in 0.18\u00bfm CMOS and uses a 1.8V power supply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5410778/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141930","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS amplitude detector for RF-BIST and calibration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS amplitude detector for RF-BIST and calibration","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"c1lf016113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051625S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403223","isNumber":"5410749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403223","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5410749","articleId":"5410778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5410782,"authors":[{"name":"Naim Ben-Hamida","affiliation":["Metro Ethernet Network, Nortel, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Naim","lastName":"Ben-Hamida","id":"38180884300"},{"name":"John Sitch","affiliation":["Metro Ethernet Network, Nortel, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Sitch","id":"37283501500"},{"name":"Phillip Flemke","affiliation":["Metro Ethernet Network, Nortel, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Phillip","lastName":"Flemke","id":"38275118300"},{"name":"Daniel Pollex","affiliation":["Metro Ethernet Network, Nortel, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Pollex","id":"37349566000"},{"name":"Peter Schvan","affiliation":["Metro Ethernet Network, Nortel, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Schvan","id":"37294298200"},{"name":"Yuriy Greshishchev","affiliation":["Metro Ethernet Network, Nortel, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Greshishchev","id":"37353239200"},{"name":"Shing-Chi Wang","affiliation":["Metro Ethernet Network, Nortel, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Shing-Chi","lastName":"Wang","id":"38272605500"},{"name":"Chris Falt","affiliation":["Metro Ethernet Network, Nortel, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Falt","id":"37344765000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5090-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5091-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5410782","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Quadrature phase shift keying","Optical receivers","Phase locked loops","CMOS technology","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Frequency","Tuning","Circuits","Optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","jitter","nanoelectronics","optical receivers","phase locked loops","quadrature phase shift keying","synchronisation","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock recovery","QPSK optical receiver","CMOS technology","jitter","on-chip differential LC VCO","power supply regulation","tone acquisition mode","charge pump PLL","data acquisition mode","DSP core","coherent receiver chip"]}],"abstract":"A clock recovery circuit for a 40 Gb/s optical coherent receiver realized in CMOS 90 nm technology is presented. The core PLL generates less 0.3 ps rms jitter for a bandwidth of 0.5 MHz. This is mainly due to the on-chip differential LC VCO with power supply regulation. The VCO operates at 11.5 GHz center frequency with a 25% tuning range. Its phase noise at 1 MHz offset is better than -110 dBc/Hz, and consumes 3 mW of power. In tone acquisition mode the PLL is a regular charge pump PLL, while in data acquisition mode the DSP core corrects the frequency through the tuning ports.

It is intended to be used with an external output stage and passive filter, for medium power applications of upto a few 100 Watts. The controller was optimized with regard to its loop gain to suppress the distortion of the output stage. In typical commercially available output stages, the distortion is dominated by dead time effects and the THD can be as low as 20 dB. The controller uses self-oscillation to generate the carrier. To control the self-oscillation a second order phase shift network is embedded in the loop. To increase the loop gain a fifth-order loop filter is added. For a switching frequency of 400kHz the controller achieves a loop gain of 51 dB, nearly flat over the audio band. For reasons of flexibility, the order of the controller is made programmable, as well as the dead time and the delay in the loop. Full spice simulations of the controller combined with an external 120 Watt output stage indicate that a THD of upto 80 dB (better than 0.01%) can be obtained even under the worst case condition of a dead time of 50 ns.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transistors","FETs","Power amplifiers","CMOS technology","Passive filters","Switching frequency","Driver circuits","Topology","Digital filters","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-frequency amplifiers","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","programmable controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated analog controller","class-D audio amplifier","CMOS technology","fifth-order loop filter","programmable controller","size 0.35 mum","voltage 3.3 V","frequency 400 kHz","power 120 W","time 50 ns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class D amplifier","dead-time distortion","self-oscillating","CMOS design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410790","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems -

Most commercial video-cameras obtain Bayer images that have to be converted to RGB ones. Even though most of these cameras are able to perform this conversion internally, when working with high-definition images this process is quite slow and impedes real-time applications. Therefore, it is interesting to explore high-speed solutions that can perform Bayer to RGB conversion outside the camera. This paper presents a color interpolation design based on bilinear interpolation and a new real-time median filter with low memory requirements. The system is designed for real-time high-definition video systems although it can be used for single frame interpolation. The median filter proposed increases the performance by about 4 dBs with respect to a simple bilinear interpolation system. This improvement in the performance is obtained without adding extra delay or memory to the classical bilinear interpolation. It only increases lightly the area. The memory consumption is reduced to two frame lines and it is implemented in less than 30% of the area available in a Spartan III S500 FPGA, working at almost 100 MHz. The system can work with high resolution frames up to 1280\u00d71024 pixels.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410826","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403223/5410749/05410826.pdf","startPage":"916","endPage":"919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-cost Bayer to RGB bilinear interpolation with hardware-aware median filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410826/","displayDocTitle":"Low-cost Bayer to RGB bilinear interpolation with hardware-aware median filter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141978","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410826/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-cost Bayer to RGB bilinear interpolation with hardware-aware median filter","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"c2pn056419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073137S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403223","isNumber":"5410749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403223","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5410749","articleId":"5410826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5410834,"authors":[{"name":"Naoufel Debbabi","affiliation":["SUPcom, El-Ghazalat, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Naoufel","lastName":"Debbabi","id":"37400202500"},{"name":"Sami Chtourou","affiliation":["U.S. Military Academy, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Chtourou","id":"37268927000"},{"name":"Ines Kammoun","affiliation":["ENIS Engineering School, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ines","lastName":"Kammoun","id":"37281923800"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["SUPcom, El-Ghazalat, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5090-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5091-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5410834","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Cost function","Mobile communication","Quality of service","Power system relaying","System performance","Bit error rate","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","error statistics","interference (signal)","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify relaying optimization","forward relaying optimization","uplink CDMA communications","constant multiple access interference cost","radio mobile cellular networks","quality of service","cooperative communications","amplify-and-forward relaying scheme","code division multiple access communications","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative Relaying","CDMA","uplink","multiple access interference cost","performance optimization"]}],"abstract":"In radio mobile cellular networks, the users located at the cell border are suffering from a bad quality of service (QoS). Cooperative communications is a promising technique that can overcome this weakness by allowing the users to profit from powerful benefits of the spatial diversity. Nevertheless, abstraction is usually made on the impact of the additional multiple access interference inherent to relaying. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that optimizes the system performance of an amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying scheme subject to a constant multiple access interference cost for the uplink CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) communications.

In this paper, we consider a mobile transmission by the OFDM/BFDM technique. Single pulse modulation (SPM) or multi pulse modulation (MPM) combined with a partial equalization of few neighboring pulses (for SPM) or co-located pulses (for MPM) at the receiver can be suited efficiently in the time-frequency lattice structure to optimize the overall system performance. In our design, we compare the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) for non equalized single pulse, to the ESIR (Equivalent SIR) of two-PM and three-PM. Then the ESIR is optimized for two-PM when ideal suppression of the interference coming from the first pulse is done. Next, residual interference (imperfect equalization) is considered in the optimization. Finally, we compare the gain brought by equalization as the number of co-located pulses is increased. The obtained simulation results show that SPM and MPM are almost equivalent when no equalization is considered. When partial equalization is considered, the higher is the number of co-located pulses, the better is the ESIR. Also, for imperfectly equalized two-PM, residual interference has low effect on the system performance when it goes higher than 1%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403223/5410749/05410836.pdf","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1007","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5410836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-pulse/single-pulse design for maximizing SIR in partially equalized OFDM systems over highly dispersive channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Scanning probe microscopy","Interference","Pulse modulation","Lattices","System performance","Mobile communication","Time frequency analysis","OFDM modulation","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersive channels","interference (signal)","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","pulse modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipulse design","single-pulse design","SIR","partially equalized OFDM systems","highly dispersive channels","mobile channels","signal transmission","interferences","mobile transmission","BFDM technique","multi pulse modulation","partial equalization","signal to interference ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-pulse/single-pulse design for maximizing SIR in partially equalized OFDM systems over highly dispersive channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141986","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-pulse/single-pulse design for maximizing SIR in partially equalized OFDM systems over highly dispersive channels","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"c3lf016041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042552S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403223","isNumber":"5410749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403223","xplore-issue":"5410749","articleId":"5410836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5410858,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The experimental results carried out demonstrate that for a six input LUT, our architecture outperforms the traditional multiplexer-based LUT, which is commonly considered the optimum architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410900","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403223/5410749/05410900.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring performance-power trade-offs for look-up tables in SRAM-based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5410900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Exploring performance-power trade-offs for look-up tables in SRAM-based FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5410900/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11142050","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring performance-power trade-offs for look-up tables in SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"b1ld036350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073805S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403223","isNumber":"5410749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403223","xplore-issue":"5410749","articleId":"5410900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5410901,"authors":[{"name":"Shuli Gao","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Royal Military College of Canada, Canada"],"firstName":"Shuli","lastName":"Gao","id":"38339600400"},{"name":"Dhamin Al-Khalili","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Royal Military College of Canada, Canada"],"firstName":"Dhamin","lastName":"Al-Khalili","id":"38277818000"},{"name":"Noureddine Chabini","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Royal Military College of Canada, Canada"],"firstName":"Noureddine","lastName":"Chabini","id":"38329966700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5090-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5091-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5410901","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Field programmable gate arrays","Educational institutions","Delay","Signal processing","Arithmetic","Signal processing algorithms","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","matrix multiplication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two level decomposition","matrix multiplication","FPGA","wide bit size elements","input matrices","wordwidth decomposition","highly optimized scalar signed multiplier","Xilinx FPGA","Altera FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an efficient design approach for the implementation of large size matrix multiplication with wide bit size elements targeting FPGAs.

Our design consumes only 8.6 mW power from a 850 mV supply voltage and this has been achieved through the use of large transistors with low current densities. The design is implemented in standard 0.13 \u00bfm CMOS technology. The amplifier has a unity-gain bandwidth of 22 GHz, and a maximum small signal gain of 9 dB. Input and output transmission lines are matched to 50 \u00bf, with the worst case return losses on the input and output of -6 dB and -8 dB, respectively.

Some major design challenges are capabilities of the comparator to operate at low voltage and dissipate low power for low-voltage DCM buck regulators having high power efficiencies under light-load condition. This paper presents a new comparator with current-controlled dynamically-biased preamplifiers. Current-controlled dynamic biasing (CCDB) is developed to lower the required supply voltage for realizing the autozeroing technique in the preamplifier, thereby allowing the proposed comparator to operate at lower supply voltage compared to that using conventional preamplifiers.

A conventional instrumentation amplifier and a buffer is used as second stage to match the high impedance output of the current conveyors to the low impedance input of an SC ADC. The buffer amplifier is composed of a conventional class A OTA, retrofitted with a positive feedback adaptive bias current supply, which offers class AB power and slew rate performance at class A linearity.

Moreover, we developed the theoretical calculation and different techniques of system level design. Each of Radio Frequency (RF) characteristics such as noise figure (NF), gain and linearity (third order intercept point, (IIP3)) is simulated taking in account the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) full scale power constraint. On the one hand, our system level simulation results proved that the receiver architecture is capable to perform spectrum sensing and to allow communication processing. The receiver performs a total gain of 51 dB and an IIP3 of -19.8 dBm for low gain mode. It achieves 105 dB as gain and 9.9 dB for noise figure for high gain mode.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2009.5411000","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403223/5410749/05411000.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2009.5411000","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)","startPage":"319","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodology of a system level design for a Cognitive Radio receiver \u201capplication for IEEE 802.22 Standard\u201d","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Methodology of a system level design for a Cognitive Radio receiver \u201capplication for IEEE 802.22 Standard\u201d","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411000/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5411000/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11142147","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methodology of a system level design for a Cognitive Radio receiver \u201capplication for IEEE 802.22 Standard\u201d","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"a3lf056484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065703S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403223","isNumber":"5410749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403223","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5410749","articleId":"5411000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5411198,"authors":[{"name":"Casey Roshau","affiliation":["North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Casey","lastName":"Roshau","id":"37402307700"},{"name":"Subbaraya Yuvarajan","affiliation":["North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Subbaraya","lastName":"Yuvarajan","id":"37266708200"},{"name":"Doug Schulz","affiliation":["North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Schulz","id":"37288043000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2949-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2950-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0160-8371"},{"format":"CD","value":"0160-8371"}],"articleNumber":"5411198","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Substrates","Conductivity","Epitaxial growth","Conductive films","Glass","X-ray scattering","Molecular beam epitaxial growth","Electrodes","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point trackers","photovoltaic power systems","solar cells","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VMPPT","PV panel","reference cell","voltage-based maximum power point tracking","open circuit voltage","main panel","buck-boost type switching converter","PSPICE-based modeling technique","PSPICE parameters","programmable system on a chip","control algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a voltage-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) scheme in which a reference cell is used to provide information on the open circuit voltage.

This increase is primarily due to the transmission of short-wavelength light (<420 nm) and is therefore greatest when used with low UV-absorbing glass and cells of a high IQE at short wavelength.

Examples of such novel devices include quantum dot (QD) based solar cells and photodetectors. However, the response of these devices to radiation effects is not well understood, and radiation effects modeling tools are not yet available. In this paper we review our numerical models and experimental investigation of radiation effects in quantum dot based solar cells. In the natural, high-radiation environment of space all solar cells suffer from degradation. Although some studies have been conducted, and test data collected, on the performance of solar cells in a radiation environment, the mechanisms of radiation-induced degradation of quantum dot superlattices (QDS) has yet to be established. We have conducted proton irradiation experiments to provide a direct comparison of radiation hardness of quantum dot based cells and regular solar cells. An approach to the development of Nano-scale Technology Computer Aided Design (NanoTCAD) simulation software for simulation of radiation effects in QDS-based photovoltaic (PV) devices is presented. The NanoTCAD tools are based on classical drift-diffusion and quantum-mechanical models for the simulation of QD PV cells.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and modeling of space radiation effects in quantum dot based nanomaterials for high-efficiency photovoltaic cells","publicationTitle":"2009 34th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2009.5411642","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 34th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5401175/5411118/05411642.pdf","startPage":"000462","endPage":"000464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2009.5411642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5411118","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and modeling of space radiation effects in quantum dot based nanomaterials for high-efficiency photovoltaic cells","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5411642/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"11152359","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and modeling of space radiation effects in quantum dot based nanomaterials for high-efficiency photovoltaic cells","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"Mpublic2430707115809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042215S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5401175","isNumber":"5411118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5401175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5411118","articleId":"5411642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5411720,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37278183200"},{"name":"Sen-Hung Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sen-Hung","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280458400"},{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292503700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5411720","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":120,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1758},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Selected mapping (SLM) schemes are commonly employed to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

Signal Process., vol. 53, no. 12, pp. 4652-4660, Dec. 2005]. To ensure that the elements of these phase rotation vectors have an equal magnitude, conversion vectors should have the form of a perfect sequence. This paper presents three novel classes of perfect sequence, each of which comprises certain base vectors and their cyclically shifted versions. Three novel low-complexity SLM schemes are then proposed based upon the unique structures of these perfect sequences. It is shown that while the PAPR reduction performances of the proposed schemes are marginally poorer than that of the traditional SLM scheme, the three schemes achieve a substantially lower computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05411720.pdf","startPage":"2916","endPage":"2921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2043142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2043142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Low-Complexity SLM Schemes for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Filter bank","Signal processing","Channel estimation","OFDM modulation","Ultra wideband technology","Cognitive radio","WiMAX","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","low-complexity selected mapping schemes","inverse fast Fourier transform","phase rotation vectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Novel Low-Complexity SLM Schemes for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5411720/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11228745","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Low-Complexity SLM Schemes for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"58tsp05-cli-2043142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062209S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5411720","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5411722,"authors":[{"name":"Tomaso Poggi","affiliation":["Biophysical and Electronic Engineering Department, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Tomaso","lastName":"Poggi","id":"37402451400"},{"name":"Francesco Comaschi","affiliation":["Biophysical and Electronic Engineering Department, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Comaschi","id":"37402444400"},{"name":"Marco Storace","affiliation":["Biophysical and Electronic Engineering Department, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Storace","id":"37274436100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5411722","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":312},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Nonlinear circuits","Circuits and systems","Control systems","Fuzzy systems","Neural networks","Linear systems","Interpolation","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine transforms","digital circuits","field programmable gate arrays","piecewise linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","digital circuit realization","nonuniform resolution","continuous piecewise affine functions","PWA mapping","functional blocks","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital architectures","nonlinear circuits","nonuniform resolution","piecewise-affine (PWA) functions"]}],"abstract":"This brief proposes a digital circuit architecture implementing a class of continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) functions.

Our focus is on diffusion strategies, where nodes communicate with their direct neighbors only, and the information is diffused across the network through a sequence of Kalman iterations and data-aggregation. We study the problems of Kalman filtering, fixed-lag smoothing and fixed-point smoothing, and propose diffusion algorithms to solve each one of these problems. We analyze the mean and mean-square performance of the proposed algorithms, provide expressions for their steady-state mean-square performance, and analyze the convergence of the diffusion Kalman filter recursions. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithms to the problem of estimating and tracking the position of a projectile. We compare our simulation results with the theoretical expressions, and note that the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2042987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2042987","startPage":"2069","endPage":"2084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5565431/05411741.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5565431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusion Strategies for Distributed Kalman Filtering and Smoothing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion Strategies for Distributed Kalman Filtering and Smoothing","volume":"55","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11513367","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5411741/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion Strategies for Distributed Kalman Filtering and Smoothing","sourcePdf":"tac-sayed-2042987-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160579S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5565431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"519","xplore-issue":"5565431","articleId":"5411741","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5411747,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Danish Nisar","affiliation":["Associate Institute of Signal Processing MSV, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5464420/5411747/5411747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Danish Nisar (S'05) was born in Karachi, Pakistan, in 1982.

Its superior performance comes however at the price of increased requirements-the knowledge of observation noise power and that of the channel frequency, as well as time correlation functions. In practical transmission scenarios, where channel correlation functions are not known or cannot be easily estimated, it is desirable to have an estimator that is robust to mismatches between the assumed and the actual channel correlation function. While such a robust estimator, for the case of an infinite number of observations, is well known for various uncertainty classes, not much attention has been paid to the practical case of a finite number of observations. We derive in this paper, the maximally robust (MR) 2-D channel estimator for the case of a finite number of pilot observations under some realistic constraints on the uncertainty class to which the 2-D channel correlation sequence belongs. We demonstrate that the correlation sequence associated with the MR estimator can be obtained by a simple semi-definite optimization procedure and is interestingly different from the well-known heuristic proposals. Simulation results establish the superiority of the proposed MR estimator over commonly employed heuristic robust estimator by as much as 3 dB in terms of the worst-case estimation MSE and around 1 dB in terms of the average BER performance under different practical transmission scenarios of interest.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2043126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05411747.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2043126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","startPage":"3163","endPage":"3172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximally Robust 2-D Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximally Robust 2-D Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11304794","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5411747/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximally Robust 2-D Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"58tsp05-mnisar-2043126-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060076S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5464420","articleId":"5411747","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5411750,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Kyun Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-Kyun","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37291322400"},{"name":"Gichul Jung","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gichul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37401389200"},{"name":"Dea-Keun Ju","affiliation":["RF Team, Research and Development Department, Ubiquitous Gwangyang and Global IT Institute, Gwangyang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dea-Keun","lastName":"Ju","id":"37408221300"},{"name":"Sungkyun Lim","affiliation":["Hawaii Center for Advanced Communications, College of Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Sungkyun","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280563200"},{"name":"Jong-Myung Woo","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Myung","lastName":"Woo","id":"37274778200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5411750","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1818},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["RFID tags","UHF antennas","Wireless sensor networks","Dipole antennas","Radiofrequency identification","Antenna radiation patterns","Wounds","Shape","Bandwidth","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","dipole antennas","impedance matching","radiofrequency identification","UHF antennas","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF RFID tag antenna","quasi-isotropic patterns","wireless sensor networks","radio frequency identification tag antenna","dipole-typed RFID tag antenna","impedance matching","size 25 mm","bandwidth 7 MHz","size 132 cm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrically small antennas","quasi-isotropic patterns","radio frequency identification (RFID) tag antennas"]}],"abstract":"An electrically small spherical UHF (911.25 MHz) radio frequency identification (RFID) tag antenna is proposed.

Although many of these methods are effective, they rely on the collection of long-term network statistics. Here, we present an approach that uses short-term observations of network features and their respective time averaged entropies. Acute changes are localized in network feature space using adaptive Wiener filtering and auto-regressive moving average modeling. The color-enhanced datagram is designed to allow a network engineer to quickly capture and visually comprehend at a glance the statistical characteristics of a network anomaly. First, average entropy for each feature is calculated for every second of observation. Then, the resultant short-term measurement is subjected to first- and second-order time averaging statistics. These measurements are the basis of a novel approach to anomaly estimation based on the well-known Fisher linear discriminant (FLD). Average port, high port, server ports, and peered ports are some of the network features used for stochastic clustering and filtering. We empirically determine that these network features obey Gaussian-like distributions. The proposed algorithm is tested on real-time network traffic data from Ohio University's main Internet connection. Experimentation has shown that the presented FLD-based scheme is accurate in identifying anomalies in network feature space, in localizing anomalies in network traffic flow, and in helping network engineers to prevent potential hazards. Furthermore, its performance is highly effective in providing a colorized visualization chart to network analysts in the presence of bursty network traffic.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2010.2041808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5464437/05411760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2010.2041808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464437","startPage":"288","endPage":"299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Network Anomaly Detection and Visualization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Network Anomaly Detection and Visualization","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293082","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5411760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Network Anomaly Detection and Visualization","sourcePdf":"tifs-celenk-2041808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127708S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5464437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5464437","articleId":"5411760","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5411763,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Mura","affiliation":["Institute for Power Generation and Storage Systems, E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5433727/5411763/5411763-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Florian Mura (S'08) received the Diploma degree in electrical engineering and information technology from RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany, in 2006, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","In March 2007, he joined the Institute for Power Generation and Storage Systems, E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University, as a Research Associate.

This paper presents a real-time reduced-order compact thermal model, which is incorporated in a pulsewidth modulation and current controlled full bridge. An accurate representation of the dynamic thermal behavior was obtained experimentally and converted into a simplified multiexponential form then combined with lookup tables that provide estimates of the device losses based on measured values of the phase current. For interfaces away from the surface, such as solder layers, a validated Flotherm model is used to predict the temperatures of the hidden layers. Comparison of the real-time temperature estimates with IR measured values obtained from a high-speed IR camera showed that the reduced-order model was capable in estimating the module's temperatures over a range of modulation conditions. This real-time model is well-suited to the continuous monitoring of the internal behavior of the electrothermal effects within power electronic modules and can thus be used as part of a prognostic tool to provide knowledge through thermal cycling by combining with thermomechanical wear out models for health management of power electronics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","volume":"25","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"11286154","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5411764/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Compact Thermal Models for Health Management of Power Electronics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Compact Thermal Models for Health Management of Power Electronics","sourcePdf":"tpel-musallam-2040634.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051351S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5463201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"5463201","articleId":"5411764","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5411778,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin Lughofer","affiliation":["Department of Knowledge based Mathematical Systems, Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5439989/5411778/5411778-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Edwin Lughofer received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Knowledge-based Mathematical Systems, Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Linz, Austria.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Knowledge-based Mathematical Systems, Johannes Keppler University of Linz.

Our learning method consists of three phases: The first phase conducts a clustering process in the input/output feature space with iterative vector quantization and projects the obtained clusters onto 1-D axes to form the fuzzy sets (centers and widths) in the antecedent parts of the rules. Hereby, the number of clusters = rules is predefined and denotes a kind of upper bound on a reasonable granularity. The second phase optimizes the rule weights in the fuzzy systems with respect to least-squares error measure by applying a sparsity-constrained steepest descent-optimization procedure. Depending on the sparsity threshold, weights of many or a few rules can be forced toward 0, thereby, switching off (eliminating) some rules (rule selection). The third phase estimates the linear consequent parameters by a regularized sparsity-constrained-optimization procedure for each rule separately (local learning approach). Sparsity constraints are applied in order to force linear parameters to be 0, triggering a feature-selection mechanism per rule. Global feature selection is achieved whenever the linear parameters of some features in each rule are (near) 0. The method is evaluated, which is based on high-dimensional data from industrial processes and based on benchmark datasets from the Internet and compared with well-known batch-training methods, in terms of accuracy and complexity of the fuzzy systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5411778/","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206098","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SparseFIS: Data-Driven Learning of Fuzzy Systems With Sparsity Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SparseFIS: Data-Driven Learning of Fuzzy Systems With Sparsity Constraints","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lughofer-2042960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133725S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5439989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5439989","articleId":"5411778","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5411784,"authors":[{"name":"River T.

The proposed snubber cell has several advantages over existing snubbering techniques. First, it provides zero-current-switching and zero-voltage-switching conditions for turning on and off, respectively, the switch over a wide load range. Second, it does not introduce extra voltage stress on the switch. Third, by taking the ripple current through the switch into account, the peak switch current during the snubber resonance period is designed to be less than the designed switch current without the snubber. Hence, the proposed snubber does not introduce extra current stress on the switch. The operating principle, procedure of designing the values of the components, and soft-switching range of the snubber will be given. The connections of the snubber cells to different switching converters will be illustrated. A performance comparison among the proposed snubber and a prior-art snubber will be addressed. The proposed snubber has been successfully applied to an example of a 200-W, 380-V/24-V, 100-kHz two-switch flyback converter.

The resulting controller can handle rapid changes in plant parameters, and it can provide nice transient behavior with arbitrarily good steady-state tracking using a control signal which remains modest in size. However, it also has some undesireable features: i) the proposed sampled-data controller achieves good performance by using a small sampling period, which results in large gains and a correspondingly poor noise tolerance, ii) a rapidly varying control signal is used, which may require a fast actuator, and iii) the closer to optimality that we wish to get, the more complex the controller. In this paper, we completely redesign the control law to significantly alleviate these problems; the new design provides better noise performance, especially when the sign of the high frequency gain is known, uses a smoother and smaller control signal, has a fixed complexity, independent of the desired level of performance, and is more intuitively appealing, in that probing, estimation, and control are now carried out in parallel rather than in series.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411787/","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5411787/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11513369","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Model Reference Adaptive Control Using Simultaneous Probing, Estimation, and Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Reference Adaptive Control Using Simultaneous Probing, Estimation, and Control","sourcePdf":"55tac09-dmiller-2042983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109354S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5565431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5565431","articleId":"5411787","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5411791,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Brunner","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy","European Commission Joint Research Centre, Ispra Varese, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5447593/5411791/5411791-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dominik Brunner (S'07) received the Diploma degree in technical computer science from the University of Applied Sciences Hof, Hof, Germany, in 2004.","From 2004 to 2006, he was a Software Engineer with SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany.

Remote-sensing satellites equipped with very high spatial resolution (VHR) multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensors can provide vital information due to their ability to map the affected areas with high geometric precision and in an uncensored manner. In this paper, we present a novel method that detects buildings destroyed in an earthquake using pre-event VHR optical and post-event detected VHR SAR imagery. The method operates at the level of individual buildings and assumes that they have a rectangular footprint and are isolated. First, the 3-D parameters of a building are estimated from the pre-event optical imagery. Second, the building information and the acquisition parameters of the VHR SAR scene are used to predict the expected signature of the building in the post-event SAR scene assuming that it is not affected by the event. Third, the similarity between the predicted image and the actual SAR image is analyzed. If the similarity is high, the building is likely to be still intact, whereas a low similarity indicates that the building is destroyed. A similarity threshold is used to classify the buildings. We demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the method for a subset of the town of Yingxiu, China, which was heavily damaged in the Sichuan earthquake of May 12, 2008. For the experiment, we use QuickBird and WorldView-1 optical imagery, and TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed SAR data.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2038274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2038274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5447593/05411791.pdf","startPage":"2403","endPage":"2420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Earthquake Damage Assessment of Buildings Using VHR Optical and SAR Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Earthquake Damage Assessment of Buildings Using VHR Optical and SAR Imagery","volume":"48","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5411791/","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11246715","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411791/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Earthquake Damage Assessment of Buildings Using VHR Optical and SAR Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-brunner-2038274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188449S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5447593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"280","xplore-issue":"5447593","articleId":"5411791","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5411792,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Fishery Radio Station, Council of Agricultural, Taipei, Taiwan","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406743300"},{"name":"Chien-Chang Hung","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Chang","lastName":"Hung","id":"37401512700"},{"name":"Yuan-Hao Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37404504600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5411792","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1054},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Resource management","Computer architecture","Semiconductor device measurement","Fast Fourier transforms","CMOS technology","Energy measurement","Very large scale integration","OFDM","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","CMOS integrated circuits","fast Fourier transforms","microprocessor chips","multiplying circuits","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA communication system","partial FFT processor","orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access resource allocation","channel quality measurement","adaptive modulation","partial cached processor","fast Fourier transform","constellation aware multiplier","power aware multiplier","twiddle factor multiplier","mixed pipelined processor","1P6M CMOS technology","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier transform (FFT)","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","very large scale integration (VLSI)"]}],"abstract":"In the orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) communication system, resource allocation plays an important role in improving the transmission performance.

This paper presents a general analytical analysis and comparison of harmonic losses of two basic continuous PWM (CPWM) schemes aimed at sinusoidal output-voltage generation. The analysis utilizes the concept of multiple polygon connections, which exist for multiphase systems, and covers all multiphase topologies with an odd phase number and single neutral connection. General harmonic distortion factors (HDFs) of sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) and harmonic injection PWM (HIPWM) are determined and compared for various phase numbers.

We tackle this by combining the strengths of robust illumination normalization, local texture-based face representations, distance transform based matching, kernel-based feature extraction and multiple feature fusion. Specifically, we make three main contributions: 1) we present a simple and efficient preprocessing chain that eliminates most of the effects of changing illumination while still preserving the essential appearance details that are needed for recognition; 2) we introduce local ternary patterns (LTP), a generalization of the local binary pattern (LBP) local texture descriptor that is more discriminant and less sensitive to noise in uniform regions, and we show that replacing comparisons based on local spatial histograms with a distance transform based similarity metric further improves the performance of LBP/LTP based face recognition; and 3) we further improve robustness by adding Kernel principal component analysis (PCA) feature extraction and incorporating rich local appearance cues from two complementary sources-Gabor wavelets and LBP-showing that the combination is considerably more accurate than either feature set alone. The resulting method provides state-of-the-art performance on three data sets that are widely used for testing recognition under difficult illumination conditions: Extended Yale-B, CAS-PEAL-R1, and Face Recognition Grand Challenge version 2 experiment 4 (FRGC-204). For example, on the challenging FRGC-204 data set it halves the error rate relative to previously published methods, achieving a face verification rate of 88.1% at 0.1% false accept rate. Further experiments show that our preprocessing method outperforms several existing preprocessors for a range of feature sets, data sets and lighting conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5411802/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11292937","pubMedId":"20172829","volume":"19","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Local Texture Feature Sets for Face Recognition Under Difficult Lighting Conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Local Texture Feature Sets for Face Recognition Under Difficult Lighting Conditions","sourcePdf":"tip-tan-2042645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098865S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5464460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"1436","xplore-issue":"5464460","articleId":"5411802","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5411806,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Shi Pang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jong-Shi Pang received the Ph.D. degree in operations research from Stanford University, Stanford, CA.","He is the Caterpillar Professor and Head of the Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

In this paper, we propose a novel Nash equilibrium (NE) problem to model concurrent communications of cognitive secondary users who compete against each other to maximize their information rate. The formulation contains constraints on the transmit power (and possibly spectral masks) as well as aggregate interference tolerable at the primary users' receivers. The coupling among the strategies of the players due to the interference constraints presents a new challenge for the analysis of this class of Nash games that cannot be addressed using the game theoretical models proposed in the literature. For this purpose, we need the framework given by the more advanced theory of finite-dimensional variational inequalities (VI). This provides us with all the mathematical tools necessary to analyze the proposed NE problem (e.g., existence and uniqueness of the solution) and to devise alternative distributed algorithms along with their convergence properties.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Cognitive Radio Systems Under Temperature-Interference Constraints: A Variational Inequality Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2043138","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05411806.pdf","startPage":"3251","endPage":"3271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2043138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411806/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of Cognitive Radio Systems Under Temperature-Interference Constraints: A Variational Inequality Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5411806/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11304796","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Cognitive Radio Systems Under Temperature-Interference Constraints: A Variational Inequality Approach","sourcePdf":"tsp-palomar-2043138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129723S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"5464420","articleId":"5411806","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5411807,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Sciences, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5565431/5411807/5411807-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Li (M'09) was born in Tianjin, China, in 1981.

(B) For the case of time-varying topologies, sufficient conditions for mean square average-consensus and almost sure consensus are given, respectively. Especially, if the network switches between jointly-containing-spanning-tree, instantaneously balanced graphs, then the designed protocol can guarantee that each individual state converges, both almost surely and in mean square, to a common random variable, whose expectation is right the average of the initial states of the whole system, and whose variance describes the static maximum mean square error between each individual state and the average of the initial states of the whole system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5565431/05411807.pdf","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2042982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2042982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5565431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus Conditions of Multi-Agent Systems With Time-Varying Topologies and Stochastic Communication Noises","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiagent systems","Time varying systems","Stochastic systems","Stochastic resonance","Network topology","Protocols","Working environment noise","Sufficient conditions","Communication system control","Graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","graph theory","mean square error methods","multi-agent systems","noise","probability","protocols","stochastic processes","telecommunication channels","time-varying networks","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent system","time-varying topology","communication noise","average-consensus problem","distributed stochastic approximation","probability limit theory","algebraic graph theory","mean square average-consensus","spanning tree","random variable","static maximum mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Average-consensus","distributed coordination","distributed estimation","multi-agent systems","stochastic systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Consensus Conditions of Multi-Agent Systems With Time-Varying Topologies and Stochastic Communication Noises","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5411807/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11513361","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Conditions of Multi-Agent Systems With Time-Varying Topologies and Stochastic Communication Noises","sourcePdf":"tac-zhang-2042982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133849S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5565431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"396","xplore-issue":"5565431","articleId":"5411807","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5411808,"authors":[{"name":"Silvana Silva Pereira","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Communications Group (SPCOM), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5446566/5411808/5411808-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Silvana Silva Pereira (S\u201906) received the M.Sc. degree from the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway, in 2003.

A necessary condition to achieve a consensus on the average of the initial values is that the topology of the underlying graph is balanced or symmetric at every time instant. However, communication impairments can make the topology vary randomly in time, and instantaneous link symmetry between pairs of nodes is not guaranteed unless an acknowledgment protocol or an equivalent approach is implemented. In this paper, we evaluate the convergence of the consensus algorithm in the mean square sense in wireless sensor networks with random asymmetric topologies. For the case of links with equal probability of connection, a closed form expression for the mean square error of the state along with the dynamical range and the optimum value of the link weights that guarantee convergence are derived. For the case of links with different probabilities of connection, an upper bound for the mean square error of the state is derived. This upper bound can be computed for any time instant and can be employed to compute a link weight that reduces the convergence time of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2043140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2043140","startPage":"2866","endPage":"2874","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05411808.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean Square Convergence of Consensus Algorithms in Random WSNs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Mean Square Convergence of Consensus Algorithms in Random WSNs","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5411808/","accessionNumber":"11228725","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411808/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean Square Convergence of Consensus Algorithms in Random WSNs","sourcePdf":"tsp-pereira-2043140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133776S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5411808","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5411813,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Katselis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens Panepistimiopolis, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Katselis","id":"37401537400"},{"name":"Eleftherios Kofidis","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Insurance Science, University of Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Eleftherios","lastName":"Kofidis","id":"37294376400"},{"name":"Athanasios Rontogiannis","affiliation":["Space Applications and Remote Sensing, National Observatory of Athens, Penteli, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Rontogiannis","id":"37294362000"},{"name":"Sergios Theodoridis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens Panepistimiopolis, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Sergios","lastName":"Theodoridis","id":"37294378100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5411813","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1309},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal processing","Wireless sensor networks","Relays","Acoustic sensors","Least squares approximation","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-OQAM systems","CP-OFDM systems","preamble-based least square channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","cyclic prefix","discrete Fourier transform","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","cyclic prefix (CP)","discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","least squares (LS)","mean squared error (MSE)","offset QAM (OQAM)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","pilots","preamble","quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, preamble-based least squares (LS) channel estimation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems of the QAM and offset QAM (OQAM) types is considered.

First, a linear mixture model is used to represent each pixel of the observed infrared imagery. Second, adaptive detection is performed on local regions in the infrared image by means of kernel-based nonparametric regression and two-parameter constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector. Kernel regression, which is one of the nonparametric regression approaches, is adopted to estimate complex clutter background.

Initially, each node has a scalar data value, and the goal is to compute the average of these values at every node (the so-called average consensus problem). Nodes iteratively exchange information with their neighbors and perform local updates until the value at every node converges to the initial network average. Much previous work has focused on algorithms where each node maintains and updates a single value; every time an update is performed, the previous value is forgotten. Convergence to the average consensus is achieved asymptotically. The convergence rate is fundamentally limited by network connectivity, and it can be prohibitively slow on topologies such as grids and random geometric graphs, even if the update rules are optimized. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical demonstration that adding a local prediction component to the update rule can significantly improve the convergence rate of distributed averaging algorithms. We focus on the case where the local predictor is a linear combination of the node's current and previous values (i.e., two memory taps), and our update rule computes a combination of the predictor and the usual weighted linear combination of values received from neighboring nodes. We derive the optimal mixing parameter for combining the predictor with the neighbors' values, and conduct a theoretical analysis of the improvement in convergence rate that can be achieved using this acceleration methodology. For a chain topology on N nodes, this leads to a factor of N improvement over standard consensus, and for a two-dimensional grid, our approach achieves a factor of \u00bfN improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2043127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2043127","startPage":"2850","endPage":"2865","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05411823.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization and Analysis of Distributed Averaging With Short Node Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimization and Analysis of Distributed Averaging With Short Node Memory","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5411823/","accessionNumber":"11228747","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411823/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and Analysis of Distributed Averaging With Short Node Memory","sourcePdf":"58tsp05-boreshkin-2043127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087864S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5411823","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5411825,"authors":[{"name":"Sayanan Sivaraman","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent and Safe Automobiles, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5475419/5411825/5411825-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sayanan Sivaraman (M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2007 from the University of Maryland, College Park, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2009 from the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with specialization in intelligent systems, robotics, and controls.","His research interests include computer vision, machine learning, intelligent vehicles, and transportation systems."]},"firstName":"Sayanan","lastName":"Sivaraman","id":"37401581700"},{"name":"Mohan Manubhai Trivedi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent and Safe Automobiles, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5475419/5411825/5411825-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Mohan Manubhai Trivedi (F'09) received the B.E. degree (with honors) from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, and the Ph.D. degree from Utah State University, Logan.","He is currently a Professor of electrical and computer engineering and the Founding Director of the Computer Vision and Robotics Research Laboratory and the Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles at the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.","Dr. Trivedi is currently an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Using the query and archiving interface for active learning (QUAIL), the passively trained vehicle-recognition system is evaluated on an independent real-world data set, and informative samples are queried and archived to perform selective sampling. A second round of learning is then performed to build an active-learning-based vehicle recognizer. Particle filter tracking is integrated to build a complete multiple-vehicle tracking system. The active-learning-based vehicle-recognition and tracking (ALVeRT) system has been thoroughly evaluated on static images and roadway video data captured in a variety of traffic, illumination, and weather conditions. Experimental results show that this framework yields a robust efficient on-board vehicle recognition and tracking system with high precision, high recall, and good localization.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2010.2040177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2010.2040177","startPage":"267","endPage":"276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5475419/05411825.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Active-Learning Framework for On-Road Vehicle Recognition and Tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"A General Active-Learning Framework for On-Road Vehicle Recognition and Tracking","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11350230","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5411825/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Active-Learning Framework for On-Road Vehicle Recognition and Tracking","sourcePdf":"tits-sivaraman-2040177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078159S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5475419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"253","xplore-issue":"5475419","articleId":"5411825","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5411829,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The temperature sensor is based on a ring oscillator, where the temperature dependence of the oscillation frequency is used for thermal sensing. The temperature sensor exhibits a resolution of 0.035\u00b0C and an inaccuracy value lower than 0.1\u00b0C in the range from 35\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C after two-point calibration. The average power consumption of the temperature sensor is only 110 nW at ten conversions per second while keeping a high resolution and accuracy. These properties allow the use of the RFID as a batteryless sensor in a wireless human body temperature monitoring system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2040314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420300","startPage":"95","endPage":"99","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5420300/05411829.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full Passive UHF Tag With a Temperature Sensor Suitable for Human Body Temperature Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5411829/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Full Passive UHF Tag With a Temperature Sensor Suitable for Human Body Temperature Monitoring","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11152003","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Passive UHF Tag With a Temperature Sensor Suitable for Human Body Temperature Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tcsii-berenguer-2040314.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053018S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5420300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"5420300","articleId":"5411829","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":5411835,"authors":[{"name":"Adolfo Anta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5565431/5411835/5411835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adolfo Anta (S'07) received the \u201cLicenciatura\u201d degree from ICAI Engineering School, Madrid, Spain, in 2002 and the M.Sc. degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 2007, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the Electrical Engineering Department.","From 2002 to 2005, he was a Design Engineer with the Space Division, EADS.

Although periodicity simplifies the analysis of the mismatch between the control design and its digital implementation, it also leads to conservative usage of resources such as CPU utilization in the case of embedded control. We present a novel technique that abandons the periodicity assumption by using the current state of the plant to decide the next time instant in which the state should be measured, the control law computed, and the actuators updated. This technique, termed self-triggered control, is developed for two classes of nonlinear control systems, namely, state-dependent homogeneous systems and polynomial systems. The wide applicability of the proposed results is illustrated in two well known physical examples: a jet engine compressor and the rigid body.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411835/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","volume":"55","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11513370","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5411835/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"To Sample or not to Sample: Self-Triggered Control for Nonlinear Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To Sample or not to Sample: Self-Triggered Control for Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-anta-2042980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091605S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5565431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"555","xplore-issue":"5565431","articleId":"5411835","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5411854,"authors":[{"name":"Jesus Acero","affiliation":["Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["J.

However, one of their major restrictions is their inability to cope with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">shape or conformation</i>\n intrinsically: HMM-based techniques have difficulty predicting the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n-dimensional shape formed by the symbols of the visible observation (VO) sequence. In order to fulfill this crucial need, we propose a novel paradigm that we named conformation-based hidden Markov models (COHMMs). This new formalism classifies VO sequences by embedding the nodes of an HMM state transition graph in a Euclidean vector space. This is accomplished by modeling the noise contained in the shape composed by the VO sequence. We cover the one-level as well as the multilevel COHMMs. Five problems are assigned to a multilevel COHMM: 1) sequence probability evaluation, 2) statistical decoding, 3) structural decoding, 4) shape decoding, and 5) learning. We have applied the COHMMs formalism to human face identification tested on different benchmarked face databases. The results show that the multilevel COHMMs outperform the embedded HMMs as well as some standard HMM-based models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5441221/05411924.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2039875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2039875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conformation-Based Hidden Markov Models: Application to Human Face Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Humans","Face","Shape","Decoding","Machine learning","Bayesian methods","Pattern recognition","Multi-stage noise shaping","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","face recognition","hidden Markov models","identification","image sequences","statistical distributions","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conformation-based hidden Markov models","human face identification","n-dimensional shape","visible observation sequence","HMM state transition graph","Euclidean vector space","multilevel COHMM","sequence probability evaluation","statistical decoding","structural decoding","shape decoding","learning","face databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-tree wavelet transform","embedded hidden Markov models","face identification","hidden Markov models (HMMs)","object contour representation","shape decoding","structural decoding"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Face","Humans","Markov Chains","Molecular Conformation","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Pattern Recognition, Visual","Protein Conformation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Conformation-Based Hidden Markov Models: Application to Human Face Identification","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5411924/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208106","pubMedId":"20172824","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conformation-Based Hidden Markov Models: Application to Human Face Identification","sourcePdf":"tnn-dbouchaffra-2039875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097598S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5441221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5441221","articleId":"5411924","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5411929,"authors":[{"name":"Stijn Cole","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, K.U.

The generalized DC equations can all be expressed in terms of matrices that are byproducts of the construction of the DC bus admittance matrix. Initialization, switching actions resulting in different topologies and simulation of the loss of DC lines amount to a simple calculation or recalculation of the DC bus admittance matrix.

There is only one transmittal delay in the delayed coupling. The fact is that in the signal transmission process, the time delay affects only the variable that is being transmitted from one system to another, then it makes sense to assume that there is only one single delay contributing to the dynamics. Some sufficient conditions for synchronization are derived based on Lyapunov functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI). In particular, the coupling matrix may be asymmetric or nondiagonal. Moreover, the transmittal delay can be different from the one in the isolated system. A distinctive feature of this work is that the synchronized state will vary in comparison with the conventional synchronized solution. Especially, the degree of the nodes and the inner delayed coupling matrix heavily influence the synchronized state. Finally, a chaotic neural network is used as the node in two regular networks to show the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2039803","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5441221/05411935.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"583","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2039803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential Synchronization of Hybrid Coupled Networks With Delayed Coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Exponential Synchronization of Hybrid Coupled Networks With Delayed Coupling","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208098","pubMedId":"20172825","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5411935/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential Synchronization of Hybrid Coupled Networks With Delayed Coupling","sourcePdf":"tnn-he-2039803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111267S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5441221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"5441221","articleId":"5411935","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":5411937,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Chen","affiliation":["Engineering and Applied Science Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5550304/5411937/5411937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lijun Chen (M'05) received the B.S. degree in physics from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; the M.S. degree in theoretical physics from the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, and from the University of Maryland at College Park; and the Ph.D. degree in control and dynamical systems from California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena.","He is a Research Scientist with the Control and Dynamical Systems Department, Caltech.

We characterize Nash equilibria of random access games, study their dynamics, and propose distributed algorithms (strategy evolutions) to achieve Nash equilibria. This provides a general analytical framework that is capable of modeling a large class of system-wide quality-of-service (QoS) models via the specification of per-node utility functions, in which system-wide fairness or service differentiation can be achieved in a distributed manner as long as each node executes a contention resolution algorithm that is designed to achieve the Nash equilibrium. We thus propose a novel medium access method derived from carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) according to distributed strategy update mechanism achieving the Nash equilibrium of random access game. We present a concrete medium access method that adapts to a continuous contention measure called conditional collision probability, stabilizes the network into a steady state that achieves optimal throughput with targeted fairness (or service differentiation), and can decouple contention control from handling failed transmissions. In addition to guiding medium access control design, the random access game model also provides an analytical framework to understand equilibrium and dynamic properties of different medium access protocols.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5550304/05411937.pdf","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1316","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2041066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2041066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550304","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Access Game and Medium Access Control Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Algorithm design and analysis","Nash equilibrium","Distributed algorithms","Quality of service","Collision avoidance","Multiaccess communication","Concrete","Steady-state","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","distributed algorithms","game theory","probability","quality of service","random processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random access game design","medium access control design","game-theoretic model","Nash equilibria","distributed algorithms","system-wide quality-of-service model","QoS models","service differentiation","per-node utility functions","contention resolution algorithm","medium access method","carrier sense multiple access-collision avoidance","CSMA/CA","distributed strategy update mechanism","conditional collision probability","decouple contention control","different medium access protocols","wireless channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contention-based medium access","control-theoretic analysis","game theory","Nash equilibrium","strategy update mechanism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Random Access Game and Medium Access Control Design","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5411937/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473496","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Access Game and Medium Access Control Design","sourcePdf":"tnet-lchen-2041066-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128033S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5550304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5550304","articleId":"5411937","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5411949,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sharifkhani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Sharifkhani","id":"37273251200"},{"name":"Ehsan Rahiminejad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Rahiminejad","id":"37400061700"},{"name":"Shah M.

The offset cancellation allows for fast open loop operation of the differential CSA. A fourfold reduction of the cell access time is achieved compared to the conventional scheme under similar cell current and bitline capacitance. Thanks to its automatic turn off nature, the proposed CSA incurs zero static power without an auxiliary turn off circuit. The reduction of the charge redistribution on the bitlines offers a low bitline dynamic power consumption as well. In this work, the proposed scheme is rigorously analyzed and compared to the conventional scheme.

The application space of different data retention MTCMOS circuit techniques is identified with various design metrics in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2039761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5755591/05411956.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2039761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5755591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ground Bouncing Noise Suppression Techniques for Data Preserving Sequential MTCMOS Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5411956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Ground Bouncing Noise Suppression Techniques for Data Preserving Sequential MTCMOS Circuits","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11972035","htmlLink":"/document/5411956/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ground Bouncing Noise Suppression Techniques for Data Preserving Sequential MTCMOS Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-hjiao-2039761-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083145S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5755591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5755591","articleId":"5411956","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5411980,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Demongeot","affiliation":["DGA DET CELAR, Bruz, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Demongeot","id":"37401525200"},{"name":"Julien Mallet","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Mallet","id":"37395058500"},{"name":"Yves Le Traon","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Le Traon","id":"37268001600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4498-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4499-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-478X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-4763"},{"format":"CD","value":"2151-4763"}],"articleNumber":"5411980","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5411980","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Data security","Information security","Risk analysis","Information analysis","Protection","Connectors","Telecommunications","Performance analysis","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","formal verification","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["declassification runtime verification","imperative program","formal foundation","automated verification","information leakage","static analysis","nonleakage property","while language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information flow","noninterference","declassification","dynamic analysis","security policies"]}],"abstract":"Declassification is required for most programs which manipulate protected data to process their results. In highly-secure programs, the declassification decision must be taken explicitly, which means that data or operations which are being declassified are known. This decision is critical and must be supported by automated verifications, which determine the risk of information leakage related to a given declassification. Currently, the available techniques are based on static analysis, which perform an over-approximation of this risk. In this paper, we study how dynamic approaches can perform more precise analysis on what is declassified and where, and finally ensure the security property, which allows declassification, at runtime.

Though system well-being analysis for engineering applications has been used mostly for electric power system reliability studies, the same principle has been extended for assessing the condition of insulators in a distribution system based on the extent of their damage. Video surveillance with fixed cameras provide the required images of power lines along with insulators at regular intervals and same is sent to a control room using remote terminal units (RTUs) for analysis. Not only the health of the insulators, but also the sagging of the lines, breakage of both insulators and lines can be captured with such cameras. This paper mainly focuses on application of wavelet-transform based feature extraction for digital image processing and SVM for subsequent condition analysis of insulators. The most significant contribution of the paper is to compute the condition indices for overhead power distribution line insulators to overcome difficulties related to vehicular applications in video surveillance. The results contained in this paper validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology for wide-scale applications in overhead power distribution system monitoring (DSM) automation.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2010.5412006","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5411991/05412006.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"99","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2010.5412006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5411991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Insulator condition analysis for overhead distribution lines using combined wavelet support vector machine (SVM)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Insulator condition analysis for overhead distribution lines using combined wavelet support vector machine (SVM)","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11137984","publicationDate":"February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5412006/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Insulator condition analysis for overhead distribution lines using combined wavelet support vector machine (SVM)","sourcePdf":"p0089-murthy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054374S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5411991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5411991","articleId":"5412006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5412014,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Different partial discharge patterns are recorded from the various samples prepared with known defects. A novel cross-wavelet transform based technique is used for feature extraction from raw noisy partial discharge signals. Noise is a significant problem in PD detection. The proposed method eliminates the requirement of denoising prior to processing and therefore it can be used to develop an automated and intelligent PD detector that requires minimal human expertise during its operation and analysis. A rough-set theory (RST) based classifier is used to classify the extracted features. Results show that the partial discharge patterns can be classified properly from the noisy waveforms. The effectiveness of the feature extraction methodology has also been verified with two other commonly used classification techniques: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based classifier and Fuzzy classifier. It is found that the type of defect within insulation can be classified efficiently with the features extracted from cross-wavelet spectra of PD waveforms by all of these methods with a reasonable degree of accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-wavelet transform as a new paradigm for feature extraction from noisy partial discharge pulses","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2010.5412014","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5411991/05412014.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2010.5412014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5411991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412014/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cross-wavelet transform as a new paradigm for feature extraction from noisy partial discharge pulses","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5412014/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11137971","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-wavelet transform as a new paradigm for feature extraction from noisy partial discharge pulses","sourcePdf":"p0157-dey.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092973S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5411991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5411991","articleId":"5412014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5412015,"authors":[{"name":"Ghulam Murtaza Hashmi","affiliation":["Power Systems and High Voltage Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/5411991/5412015/5412015-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ghulam Murtaza Hashmi (M'03) was born in Lahore, Pakistan, on August 05, 1970.

The proposed model can be used to estimate the length of the practical CC lines at which PDs due to falling trees can be detected and localized; thus, deciding the number and positioning of the sensors over a particular length of the CC lines. The different noise sources have been described that cause interference with low level PD signals, which is a major challenge for on-line/on-site condition monitoring.

Different sources of PD have different effects on the insulation performance of power apparatus. Therefore, discrimination between PD sources is of great interest to both system utilities and equipment manufacturers. This paper investigates the use of a wide bandwidth PD on-line measurement system consisting of a radio frequency current transducer (RFCT) sensor, a digital storage oscilloscope and a high performance personal computer to facilitate automatic PD source identification. Three artificial PD models were used to simulate typical PD sources which may exist within power system apparatus. Wavelet analysis was applied to pre-process measurement data obtained from the wide bandwidth PD sensor. This data was then processed using correlation analysis to cluster the discharges into different groups. A machine learning technique, namely the support vector machine (SVM) was then used to identify between the different PD sources. The SVM is trained to differentiate between the inherent features of each discharge source signal. Laboratory experiments where the trained SVM was tested using measurement data from the RFCT as opposed to conventional measurement data indicate that this approach has a robust performance and has great potential for use with field measurement data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial discharge source discrimination using a support vector machine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2010.5412017","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5411991/05412017.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2010.5412017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5411991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412017/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","displayDocTitle":"Partial discharge source discrimination using a support vector machine","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5412017/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11137966","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial discharge source discrimination using a support vector machine","sourcePdf":"p0189-hao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049752S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5411991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5411991","articleId":"5412017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5412047,"authors":[{"name":"Rafidah Ahmad","affiliation":["Collaborative MicroElectronic Design Excellence Centre (CEDEC), Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rafidah","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37408613900"},{"name":"Othman Sidek","affiliation":["Collaborative MicroElectronic Design Excellence Centre (CEDEC), Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Othman","lastName":"Sidek","id":"37268300600"},{"name":"Shukri Korakkottil Kunhi Mohd","affiliation":["Collaborative MicroElectronic Design Excellence Centre (CEDEC), Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Shukri Korakkottil Kunhi","lastName":"Mohd","id":"37401656200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5223-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5224-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412047","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of the CRC block for Zigbee Standard on FPGA","abstract":"CRC (cyclic redundancy check) block was developed on FPGA (field programmable gate array) in order to meet the needs for simple, low-power and low-cost wireless communication such as Zigbee.

In order to achieve maximum torque per ampere (MTPA), knowledge of the motor parameters is necessary. Due to the saturation effect, variation of the motor parameters such as inductances is not avoidable. The main contribution of this paper is to use the well known adaptive input-output feedback linearization (AIOFL) technique for robust MTPA control of IPMSM with online simultaneous estimation of direct and quadrature axis inductances (Ld, Lq). The overall stability of this controller is analytically proved based on Lyapunov theory. It is found that under persistency of excitation (PE) condition, the errors of two-axis fluxes and as well as the estimation errors in parameters Ld and Lq asymptotically converge to zero. In addition, the variation of stator resistance due to changes in temperature or frequency degrades the performance of stator linkage flux estimator and controller. Online estimation of the stator resistance using a PI estimator is also employed in this paper.

The model specifically accounts for the very strong gain saturation and the ultrafast gain dynamics in UL-SOAs. Due to the UL-SOA's length, the weak but fast intraband effects can strongly interact with the input signals. For this reason, UL-SOAs have a tremendous four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency even for large wavelength detunings. Therefore, it is necessary that the UL-SOA model is a time-domain model so that all FWM products and their interaction with other FWM products are automatically calculated. These FWM products need to be considered in simulations, because they contribute to the UL-SOA's saturation in addition to amplified spontaneous emission. Moreover, due to the time-domain modeling, pseudorandom bit sequence signals can be applied to the model for simulating telecommunication applications. Other aspects that should be considered when modeling UL-SOAs are the gain parametrization and the ultrafast gain dynamics. The wavelength-dependent material gain needs to be properly represented close to the transparency, since most of the device is deeply saturated. The gain dynamics have to be dynamically modeled with rate equations automatically incorporating the limited bandwidths of the different nonlinear gain effects. Although usually not considered for short SOAs, the implementation of weak nonlinear effects like free carrier absorption and two-photon absorption is important due to the long interaction length in UL-SOAs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Absorption","Numerical models","Numerical simulation","Four-wave mixing","Spontaneous emission","Differential equations","Nonlinear equations","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","high-speed optical techniques","laser tuning","multiwave mixing","semiconductor optical amplifiers","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain modeling","ultralong semiconductor optical amplifiers","gain saturation","ultrafast gain dynamics","SOA","fast intraband effects","four-wave mixing","wavelength detuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Four-wave mixing","simulation model","ultralong semiconductor optical amplifiers (UL-SOA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.2009.2036864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/5412123/05412125.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2009.2036864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Domain Modeling of Ultralong Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Modeling of Ultralong Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412125/","volume":"46","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412125/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11191333","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Modeling of Ultralong Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jqe-prunge-2036864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062252S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"5412123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5412123","articleId":"5412125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5412129,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Bree","affiliation":["Weierstrasse-Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Analysis and Stochastic, Berlin, Germany","Max Born Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Carsten Br\u00e9e was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1976.

Finally, the complexity overhead of such a flexible design is only about 18% w.r.t. optimized single-standard solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412319","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05412319.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible state-metric recursion unit for a multi-standard BCJR decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412319/","displayDocTitle":"A flexible state-metric recursion unit for a multi-standard BCJR decoder","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150571","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412319/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible state-metric recursion unit for a multi-standard BCJR decoder","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"CE503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080401S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5412322,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279415500"},{"name":"Tao Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37401569000"},{"name":"Huang Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37403893200"},{"name":"Yongmi Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yongmi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406582600"},{"name":"Xinhong Zhou","affiliation":["Shandong College of Electronic Technology, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xinhong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406430500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5544-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5543-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3873-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412322","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Support vector machines","Discrete wavelet transforms","Face detection","Support vector machine classification","Feature extraction","Principal component analysis","Independent component analysis","Image recognition","Linear discriminant analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","face recognition","image representation","image resolution","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet-based face recognition method","support vector machine","facial representation method","five-step multiresolution method","two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform","error rate reduction"]}],"abstract":"A new method of facial representation proposed for face recognition by support vector machine (SVM).

And then the candidate regions of the license plate are binarized and their VPMs (vertical projection map) are worked out, and one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform is applied to the VPMs, and the wavelet coefficients are set as zero and then the VPMs are reconstructed.

A neural network with Gaussian radial basis function in the hidden layer is employed to approximate the uncertain system.

Due to the difficulty of selecting superior variables to design a good forecasting mode, few empirical studies have discussed the influence of explainable variables. In this paper, a new forecasting model is constructed; we adopt the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to select the optimal input layer neurons to predict NTD/USD exchange rates by the back propagation network (BPN), called PSOBPN model. There are several steps in this experiment: first, we divided the whole data into six periods of sliding windows. Second, we selected superior variables by the PSO method, and we selected 10 variables within the entire 27 variables. Finally, we forecasted the exchange rate by BPN with the selected variables. The results showed that the PSOBPN achieves the best forecasting performance and is closely matched with the actual exchange rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2009.215","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410746/5412194/05412556.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"663","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC)","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2009.215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting Exchange Rates Using Integration of Particle Swarm Optimization and Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting Exchange Rates Using Integration of Particle Swarm Optimization and Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11140727","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5412556/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting Exchange Rates Using Integration of Particle Swarm Optimization and Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"pid992488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056077S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5410746","isNumber":"5412194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410746","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5412194","articleId":"5412556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5412567,"authors":[{"name":"Danish Kalim","affiliation":["Mixed Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Danish","lastName":"Kalim","id":"37399321800"},{"name":"Denis Erguvan","affiliation":["Mixed Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Erguvan","id":"37399322900"},{"name":"Renato Negra","affiliation":["Mixed Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Negra","id":"37275858200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412567","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1612},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412567","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","Power amplifiers","CMOS technology","Power generation","Wireless LAN","System-on-a-chip","High power amplifiers","Costs","Energy consumption","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","low-power electronics","lumped parameter networks","MMIC power amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system on chip","broadband CMOS class-E power amplifier","single stage class-E PA","broadband class-E PA","lumped element load transformation network","CMOS technology","power added efficiency","wireless local area network","bluetooth","SOC","WLAN application","size 90 nm","gain 8.9 dB","voltage 2.5 V","bandwidth 2.3 GHz to 3.3 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband power amplifiers (PAs)","CMOS technology","class-E","load transformation networks (LTNs)","switching-mode power amplifiers (SMPAs)","system on chip (SOC)"]}],"abstract":"High level integration for system on chip (SOC) applications motivates the development of broadband power amplifiers (PAs) in low cost CMOS technology to reduce size and power consumption of any wireless system.

The measurement of the Class E performance over large range of drain supply voltages confirmed its appropriateness for polar transmitter as a good efficiency was maintained at large output power back-off, i.e. PAE equal to 48% was measured at 11 dB back off.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Radio transmitters","Power generation","Voltage","High power amplifiers","Prototypes","HEMTs","Power amplifiers","Power system harmonics","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","polar semiconductors","power amplifiers","power semiconductor devices","radio transmitters","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class E amplifier","polar radio transmitters","HEMT devices","power added efficiency","supply voltage equal","second harmonics","third harmonics","power 10 W","frequency 2.5 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Efficiency","Power Amplifier","Class E","Polar Transmitters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412570","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05412570.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High efficiency GaN class E amplifier for polar transmitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High efficiency GaN class E amplifier for polar transmitter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412570/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412570/","accessionNumber":"11150554","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High efficiency GaN class E amplifier for polar transmitter","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"CE105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040395S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5412576,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Frebrowski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Frebrowski","id":"37399970900"},{"name":"Slim Boumaiza","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Slim","lastName":"Boumaiza","id":"37283433900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412576","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":715},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412576","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Gallium nitride","Circuits and systems","III-V semiconductor materials","Topology","Costs","Transmitters","Linearity","Frequency","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse class F power amplifier","push-pull configuration","current-mode class D PA","planar half-wave balun","equal power division","drain efficiency","bandwidth 80 MHz","frequency 2.46 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier (PA)","inverse class F","gallium nitride (GaN)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an inverse class F (class F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n) power amplifier (PA) using a 10 W gallium nitride (GaN) transistor, in push-pull configuration.

In order to secure low-voltage scalability and allow for potential rail-to-rail operation under an ultralow supply voltage, the CMOS inverter is chosen as the basic amplifier stage. The core of the LNA gain stage comprises two CMOS inverters. To realize wideband operation with area scalability, two band broadening techniques that require neither inductors nor capacitors are adopted. First, to reduce the Miller capacitance, the classic Cherry-Hooper band broadening technique is applied to the CMOS inverterbased amplifier. Second, an active frequency peaking technique is introduced with the use of feedback through another CMOS inverter. The scalability and wideband characteristics of the proposed LNA are confirmed by comparing chips fabricated using 180 nm and 90 nm CMOS process technologies.

For such attacks, several different countermeasures can be done at different levels abstraction. But all published countermeasures lead to a significant area and power consumption overhead. In this paper, we present a new countermeasure against DPA attack which also leads to very small implementation compared to existing countermeasures such as the most used: masking schemes. The proposed approach is to use a correlated power noise generator to removes the design power correlation with the secret key. Its efficiency is proved with a practical DPA attack realization on Actel Fusion FLASH FPGA and Xilinx Virtex 4 SRAM FPGA. With the proposed countermeasures, the full 128-bits AES implementation on Xilinx Virtex 4 has a smaller area overhead (12.78 times less) than masking scheme countermeasures.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05412604.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412604","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlated power noise generator as a low cost DPA countermeasures to secure hardware AES cipher","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412604/","displayDocTitle":"Correlated power noise generator as a low cost DPA countermeasures to secure hardware AES cipher","htmlLink":"/document/5412604/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11150564","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlated power noise generator as a low cost DPA countermeasures to secure hardware AES cipher","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"CE305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093901S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5412606,"authors":[{"name":"Leehter Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Leehter","lastName":"Yao","id":"37306585200"},{"name":"Wei-Jun Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Jun","lastName":"Pan","id":"37394189100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5544-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5543-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3873-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412606","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Fuzzy sets","Robust stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","robust control","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy adaptive controller","fuzzy sets","robust controller","supervisory scaling gain","closed loop nonlinear system","stability","Lyapunov function","modulated membership function","multiinput-multioutput uncertain nonlinear system","microgenetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive fuzzy controller for controlling a multi-input-multi-output uncertain nonlinear system is proposed in this paper.

The registration process determines the optimal transformation which will align the two images. This has applications in many fields as diverse as medical images analysis, pattern matching and computer vision for robotics, as well as remotely sensed data processing. A wide range of registration techniques has been developed for many different types of applications and data. Exhaustive search is computationally expensive and the computational cost increases exponentially with the number of transformation parameters and the size of the data set. Therefore, in this work, we describe an efficient algorithm of image registration that uses genetic algorithms within a multi-resolution framework based on the wavelet and the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). We combine local search methods with global ones balancing exploration and exploitation, to speed up the search of the best transformation parameters. Experimental results show that the NSCT is a promising method for registration of satellite images compared to the wavelet transform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412608/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11150476","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412608/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonsubsampled contourlet transform combined with genetic algorithms for registration of satellite imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonsubsampled contourlet transform combined with genetic algorithms for registration of satellite imaging","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SC406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072151S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5412615,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas M.

One of the most commonly used groups of 3D algorithms is the stereo matching one. It obtains a stereoscopic image, which includes information about the distance from the camera to the objects in the image. Several algorithms have been proposed to obtain an accurate depth map. Among them, those based on Belief-Propagation message passing have shown great performance. However, the iterative process carried out leads to high consumption of resources, especially memory traffic. Implementations in CPUs are very slow. Moreover, the inherent parallelism this algorithm shows makes it a good candidate either for GPU or FPGA implementations. In this paper we present a high-definition depth estimation architecture based on BP for FPGA platforms. The architecture proposed uses a bank of DDR2 memories able to work at 200 MHz to reduce the execution time required for obtaining high-definition depth maps. Moreover, to generate data at the maximum frequency allowed by the DDR2 memory, several improvements in the architecture are proposed. The architecture has been implemented in a Xilinx Virtex 5 330 VLX FPGA. As a result, a high-definition depth map with 96 disparity levels can be obtained in less than 0.4 seconds.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412615","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05412615.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High memory throughput FPGA architecture for high-definition Belief-Propagation stereo matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412615/","displayDocTitle":"High memory throughput FPGA architecture for high-definition Belief-Propagation stereo matching","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412615/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150479","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High memory throughput FPGA architecture for high-definition Belief-Propagation stereo matching","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SC501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052336S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5412616,"authors":[{"name":"Rym Ouertani","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Rym","lastName":"Ouertani","id":"37407916100"},{"name":"Ghaya Rekaya Ben-Othman","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Ghaya Rekaya","lastName":"Ben-Othman","id":"37399007000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412616","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Lattices","MIMO","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Receiving antennas","Constellation diagram","Circuits and systems","Telecommunications","Detection algorithms","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","decoding","linear codes","MIMO communication","multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time codes","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Stack algorithm","limited tree-search","data detection algorithms","MIMO systems","finite constellations","QAM","quadrature amplitude modulation","decoding lattice","M-Stack decoder","multiple-input multiple-output systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","lattice decoding","tree-search algorithm","Stack decoder","complexity","QRD-Stack"]}],"abstract":"Due to the capacity achievable, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems witnessed more interest in recent years. Several data detection algorithms are available for MIMO systems, especially the tree-search ones which offer lower complexity comparing to the ML receiver. In this paper, we are interested in one of tree-search algorithms, which is the Stack decoder. Nevertheless, the stack decoder is only proposed to decode MIMO systems employing finite constellations, as the QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). In this work, we introduce a new Stack decoder capable of decoding lattice and we call it the M-Stack decoder. The principle idea behind it is to generate M nodes at each tree-level and so to reduce the infinite alphabet of the lattice to only M components at each step. Then, we propose to adapt it to decode QAM constellations. This one is compared to the known QRD-Stack algorithm. While both visit the same number of nodes, the proposed M-Stack algorithm offers lower computational complexity and it is much faster than the QRD-Stack one.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05412616.pdf","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stack algorithm with limited tree-search","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412616","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Stack algorithm with limited tree-search","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412616/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11150478","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5412616/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stack algorithm with limited tree-search","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SC502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0539S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5412635,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Doman","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Doman","id":"37399375500"},{"name":"Daisuke Deguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Deguchi","id":"37393580000"},{"name":"Tomokazu Takahashi","affiliation":["Faculty of Economics and Information, Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomokazu","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277758700"},{"name":"Yoshito Mekada","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Chukyo University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshito","lastName":"Mekada","id":"37271356900"},{"name":"Ichiro Ide","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Ichiro","lastName":"Ide","id":"37331892700"},{"name":"Hiroshi Murase","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Murase","id":"37271358200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5544-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5543-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3873-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412635","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412635","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Shape","Information science","Robustness","Object detection","Costs","Learning systems","Cameras","Face detection","Optical reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","image colour analysis","image texture","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascaded traffic sign detector","generative learning method","object detection method","target detection","image texture","car-mounted camera images"]}],"abstract":"We propose a method for construction of a cascaded traffic sign detector.

The post-linearization technique adopts a folded cascode diode with a resistor and a capacitor in parallel as a third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) sinker. The LNA with the post-linearization technique has a +8.33 dBm IIP3, a power gain of 10.02 dB, and a noise figure of 3.05 dB, while consuming 6 mA from a supply voltage of 1.8 V. Comparison with the characteristics of the LNA without using post-linearization technique, the IIP3 is improved 6.21 dB, and the IMD3 can be reduced 12.77 dB. Moreover, the performances of noise figure and power consumption rise 0.09 dB and 0.08 mW, and the power gain lowers 0.3 dB after using the technique only. This technique indeed improves the linearity performance without obvious effects.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Gain","Noise figure","Radio frequency","Diodes","Resistors","Capacitors","Intermodulation distortion","Voltage","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","linearisation techniques","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-linearization technique","high-linearity LNA","RF CMOS technology","folded cascode diode","resistor","capacitor","third-order intermodulation distortion sinker","IMD3 sinker","frequency 5.5 GHz","size 0.18 mum","gain 10.02 dB","noise figure 3.05 dB","current 6 mA","voltage 1.8 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2009.40","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410746/5412194/05412650.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2009.40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Post-Linearization Technique for Fully Integrated 5.5 GHz High-Linearity LNA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Post-Linearization Technique for Fully Integrated 5.5 GHz High-Linearity LNA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412650/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412650/","accessionNumber":"11140773","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Post-Linearization Technique for Fully Integrated 5.5 GHz High-Linearity LNA","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"pid978708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113854S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5410746","isNumber":"5412194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410746","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5412194","articleId":"5412650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5412663,"authors":[{"name":"Tadashi Horiuchi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Matsue National College of Technology, Matsue, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Horiuchi","id":"37287573900"},{"name":"Satoru Kato","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Matsue National College of Technology, Matsue, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoru","lastName":"Kato","id":"37404810800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5544-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5543-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3873-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412663","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412663","abstract":"It is fundamental work to translate the historical characters called \"kuzushi-ji\" into the contemporary characters in Japanese historical studies. In this paper, we develop the Japanese historical character recognition system using the directional element features and modular neural networks. Modular neural networks consist of two kinds of classifiers: a rough classifier to find the several candidates of categories for the input pattern, and a set of fine-classifiers that determine the category of the input pattern as the final result of character recognition. We construct the rough-classifier using the self-organizing maps (SOM), which can derive the multi-templates for each category from input data. The fine-classifiers are realized using multilayered neural networks, each of which solves the two-category classification problem. We also use the rough-classifier for the selection the training samples in the learning process of multilayered neural networks in order to reduce the learning time. Through the experiments of historical character recognition for 57 character categories, we confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the conventional research.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Feature extraction","Educational institutions","Self organizing feature maps","Computer networks","Data preprocessing","Vectors","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","feature extraction","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular neural networks","Japanese historical character recognition system","directional element features","rough classifier","self-organizing maps","multilayered neural networks","learning process","two-category classification problem","feature vector extraction"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2009.57","startPage":"1507","endPage":"1510","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410746/5412194/05412663.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2009.57","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Japanese Historical Character Recognition Using Modular Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Study on Japanese Historical Character Recognition Using Modular Neural Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11140786","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5412663/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on Japanese Historical Character Recognition Using Modular Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"pid981650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06875S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5410746","isNumber":"5412194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410746","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5412194","articleId":"5412663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5412674,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Jane Shuai","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Minghsin University of Science and Technology, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Jane","lastName":"Shuai","id":"37399641400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5544-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5543-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3873-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412674","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412674","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Foundries","Costs","Integrated circuit technology","Production","Collaboration","Decision making","Switches","Time to market","Fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","disasters","fuzzy set theory","integral equations","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit manufacture","operations research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy multiple criteria decision making partnership selection model","multiple criteria evaluation model","international multiple foundry partnership selection","capacity shortage","natural disaster","management culture","technology level","fuzzy integral","synthetic performance evaluation","Taiwan consumer IC design house"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a multiple criteria evaluation model for international multiple foundry partnership selection.

The classes are obtained according to buffers states and channels conditions. We offer priority to users having a delay sensitive traffic by considering those who have the fullest buffer and good channel conditions. Moreover, we propose to use the superposition coding technique to increase the system capacity. In fact, we will allow a degraded user (having bad channel condition) and a potential user (having good channel condition) to share the same subcarrier. At the degraded user side, the receiver will proceed as usual and will consider the information sent to the potential user as an additive noise. At the potential user side, a successive decoding process will be adopted. To avoid error propagation, which can occur in this case, the amount of transmitted power to each user will be optimized accordingly. A suboptimal resource allocation algorithm, based on the mentioned superposition scheme and users classification, is derived. Simulation results confirm that the proposed technique offers a proportional fairness allocation and outperforms the classical algorithms in terms of total throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412685","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05412685.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation algorithm in downlink of OFDMA systems based on users' classification and superposition coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412685/","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation algorithm in downlink of OFDMA systems based on users' classification and superposition coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150493","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412685/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation algorithm in downlink of OFDMA systems based on users' classification and superposition coding","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SC204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078504S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5412686,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Guy Descure","affiliation":["ENST de Paris, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Guy","lastName":"Descure","id":"37391790900"},{"name":"Mohamed Oussama Damen","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed Oussama","lastName":"Damen","id":"37266498600"},{"name":"Sofi\u00e8ne Affes","affiliation":["NRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofi\u00e8ne","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412686","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Maximum likelihood decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Lattices","Receiving antennas","Adaptive signal detection","Rayleigh channels","Maximum likelihood estimation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","adaptive signal processing","decoding","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive preprocessing","MIMO systems","Rayleigh fading channels","nulling-and-cancelling detection","zero forcing detection feedback equalizer","channel matrix","past channel information","ad-hoc fixed parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mulitple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Bell Labs layered space-time (BLAST)","Rayleigh fading channel","adaptive detection","detection ordering"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, considering a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, we expose an adaptive method for a nulling-and-cancelling detection scheme.

In particular, in a single relay network, the asynchronous OFDM NAF provides DMT as great as the one of a 2 \u00d7 1 multiple input single output (MISO) channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412687","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05412687.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage analysis of general asynchronous OFDM amplify-and-forward cooperative networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage analysis of general asynchronous OFDM amplify-and-forward cooperative networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412687/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150489","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5412687/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage analysis of general asynchronous OFDM amplify-and-forward cooperative networks","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SC201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073032S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5412692,"authors":[{"name":"Keyvan Zarifi","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada","INRS-EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Keyvan","lastName":"Zarifi","id":"37284691900"},{"name":"Sofiene Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofiene","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412692","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed processing","Array signal processing","Wireless sensor networks","Signal processing","Interference","Scattering","Circuits and systems","Intelligent networks","Impedance","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","radio receivers","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing techniques","wireless sensor networks","distributed beamforming techniques","unintended receivers","null-steering beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beampattern","Distributed beamforming","Nullsteering beamforming","Wireless sensor networks"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed processing techniques for beamforming in wireless sensor networks","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05412692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412692","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412692","abstract":"A main task in distributed beamforming (DBF) techniques for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is to maximize the received signal power at the access point (AP) while inflicting small interfering effect on unintended receivers. When the DBF nodes are unaware of the directions of unintended receivers, interference at the latter receivers may be substantially reduced by forming a beampattern with a narrow mainlobe that is pointed towards the AP. However, such an approach requires the DBF nodes to be sporadically scattered over a large area and, hence, increases the probability of the loss of their inter-connection. Assuming that nodes are uniformly distributed in the network, we show how the DBF nodes can be intelligently selected to ameliorate the network disconnectivity problem. In turn, when the directions of unintended receivers are known, one may aim to apply the so-called null-steering beamforming approach to effectively nullify the received power at those directions. However, it can be shown that implementing a null-steering beamformer in WSNs requires each node to be aware of the locations of all other nodes in the network; a requirement that opposes the distributed nature of WSNs. For such a scenario, we approximate the null-steering beamformer with another beamformer that is amenable to a distributed implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11150497","htmlLink":"/document/5412692/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed processing techniques for beamforming in wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed processing techniques for beamforming in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SC101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096189S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5412692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5412697,"authors":[{"name":"Wassim Jouini","affiliation":["SUPELEC/IETR, France"],"firstName":"Wassim","lastName":"Jouini","id":"37399499400"},{"name":"Damien Ernst","affiliation":["University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Ernst","id":"37281856000"},{"name":"Christophe Moy","affiliation":["SUPELEC/IETR, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Moy","id":"37294411000"},{"name":"Jacques Palicot","affiliation":["SUPELEC/IETR, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Palicot","id":"37269478700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412697","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Decision making","Chromium","Signal processing algorithms","Engines","Hardware","Software radio","Radio control","Communication system control","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision making","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-armed bandit","cognitive radio","upper confidence bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Decision making","Multi-Armed Bandit","Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412697","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412697","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","abstract":"We suggest in this paper that many problems related to Cognitive Radio's (CR) decision making inside CR equipments can be formalized as Multi-Armed Bandit problems and that solving such problems by using Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms can lead to high-performance CR devices.

Faults attacks are a powerful tool to break some implementations of robust cryptographic algorithms such as AES and DES. Various kind of fault attacks scenarios have been published. However, very few publications available in the public literature detail the practical realization of such attacks. In this paper we present the result of a practical fault attack on AES in WDDL and its comparison with its non-protected equivalent. The practical faults on an FPGA running an AES encrypt or are realized by under-powering it and further exploited using Piret's attack. The results show that WDDL is protected against setup violation attacks by construction because a faulty bit is replaced by a null bit in the cipher text. Therefore, the fault leaks no exploitable information. We also give a theoretical model for the above results. Other references have already studied the potential of fault protection of the resynchronizing gates (delay-insensitive). In this paper, we show that non-resynchronizing gates (hence combinatorial DPL such as WDDL) are natively immune to setup time violation attacks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WDDL is Protected against Setup Time Violation Attacks","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC)","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2009.40","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412677/5412840/05412854.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2009.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"WDDL is Protected against Setup Time Violation Attacks","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412854/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140823","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WDDL is Protected against Setup Time Violation Attacks","confLoc":"Lusanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"3824a073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065535S","chronDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412677","isNumber":"5412840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412677","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5412840","articleId":"5412854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5412855,"authors":[{"name":"Toshinori Fukunaga","affiliation":["NTT Information Sharing Platform Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshinori","lastName":"Fukunaga","id":"37407992600"},{"name":"Junko Takahashi","affiliation":["NTT Information Sharing Platform Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Junko","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37406960200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4972-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412855","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":627},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Large scale integration","ISO standards","IEC standards","Clocks","Smart cards","Doped fiber amplifiers","Fault diagnosis","Laboratories","Telegraphy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault attack","cryptographic LSI","ISO-IEC 18033-3 block ciphers","AES keys","DES","Camellia","CAST-128","SEED","MISTY1","clock signal","Piret attack"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault attack","clock glitch","LSI","block cipher"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412855","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2009.34","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC)","abstract":"This paper presents practical fault attack results on six kinds of block ciphers listed in ISO/IEC 18033-3 that are implemented on an LSI: AES, DES, Camellia, CAST-128, SEED, and MISTY1.

We also succeeded in recovering AES keys in the LSI using Piret's attack, which uses only one faulty cipher text obtained using the proposed experimental environment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2009.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412840","startPage":"84","endPage":"92","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412677/5412840/05412855.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Fault Attack on a Cryptographic LSI with ISO/IEC 18033-3 Block Ciphers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5412855/","displayDocTitle":"Practical Fault Attack on a Cryptographic LSI with ISO/IEC 18033-3 Block Ciphers","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140824","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Fault Attack on a Cryptographic LSI with ISO/IEC 18033-3 Block Ciphers","confLoc":"Lusanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"3824a084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044338S","chronDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412677","isNumber":"5412840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412677","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5412840","articleId":"5412855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5412856,"authors":[{"name":"Laurie Genelle","affiliation":["Oberthur Technologies, France"],"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Genelle","id":"37400444300"},{"name":"Christophe Giraud","affiliation":["Oberthur Technologies, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Giraud","id":"37411021200"},{"name":"Emmanuel Prouff","affiliation":["Oberthur Technologies, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Prouff","id":"37400444700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4972-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5412856","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":295},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412856","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Circuit faults","Cryptography","Protection","Security","Testing","Smart cards","Doped fiber amplifiers","Costs","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","smart cards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AES","cryptographic algorithms","fault attack detection","digest values","countermeasure","fault model","data masking","smart card"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault Attacks","Countermeasure","AES"]}],"abstract":"On smart card environment, speed and memory optimization of cryptographic algorithms are an ongoing preoccupation.

However, even if this algorithm does not reveal information on the secrets in case of a fault attack, it can not be used to safely implement a crypto-system involving an exponentiation. In this paper, we propose a new exponentiation method without this drawback and give a security proof of resistance to fault attacks.

This paper gives practical results demonstrating that the non-volatile memory can be erased with UV light by investigating the effects of UV-Clight with a wavelength of 254 nm on four different depackaged microcontrollers. We demonstrate that an adversary can use this effect to attack an AES software implementation by manipulating the 256- bit S-box table. We show that if only a single byte of the table is changed, 2 500 pairs of correct and faulty encrypted inputs are sufficient to recover the key with a probability of 90%, in case the key schedule is not modified by the attack. Furthermore, we emphasize this by presenting a practical attack on an AES implementation running on an 8-bit microcontroller. Our attack involves only a standard decapsulation procedure and the use of alow-cost UV lamp.","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2009.37","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412677/5412840/05412863.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2009.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Fault Attacks on AES: A Threat in Violet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optical Fault Attacks on AES: A Threat in Violet","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140832","htmlLink":"/document/5412863/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Fault Attacks on AES: A Threat in Violet","confLoc":"Lusanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"3824a013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065281S","chronDate":"6-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412677","isNumber":"5412840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412677","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5412840","articleId":"5412863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5412907,"authors":[{"name":"Da-hai Li","affiliation":["Sch. of Mech.

Compared with the traditional single rate sampling method, the results indicate that this method has better robustness and prediction accuracy, and the prediction mean absolute percentage error is 0.66%, in which only two training data are added.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Training data","Robust control","Control system synthesis","Modeling","Mathematical model","Electrohydraulics","Servomechanisms","Robustness","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","modelling","regression analysis","servomechanisms","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector regression","online SVR","multirate sampling","control system modeling","training data density","local data-intensive sliding time window","multichannel electrohydraulic force servo synchronous loading system","prediction accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["support vector regression","multirate sampling","outlier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTM.2009.5412907","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Test and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Test and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405663/5412875/05412907.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTM.2009.5412907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling method of support vector regression using multirate sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling method of support vector regression using multirate sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412907/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412907/","accessionNumber":"11220374","conferenceDate":"5-6 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling method of support vector regression using multirate sampling","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042851S","chronDate":"5-6 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405663","isNumber":"5412875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405663","xplore-issue":"5412875","articleId":"5412907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5412958,"authors":[{"name":"Weijie Shen","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"lastName":"Weijie Shen","id":"37403532000"},{"name":"Haixin Sun","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"lastName":"Haixin Sun","id":"37403470500"},{"name":"En Cheng","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"lastName":"En Cheng","id":"37286139700"},{"name":"Fei Yuan","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"lastName":"Fei Yuan","id":"37401394000"},{"name":"Yonghuai Zhang","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"lastName":"Yonghuai Zhang","id":"37405819900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4699-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-5592"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-5606"}],"articleNumber":"5412958","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic noise","Underwater acoustics","OFDM modulation","Blanking","Underwater communication","Military communication","Demodulation","Noise reduction","Noise cancellation","Acoustic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise suppression","DFT-SOFDM system","high date rate underwater acoustic transmission scheme","underwater military communication","multicarrier transmission systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulsive noise","DFT-SOFDM","underwater acoustic","blanking","clipping"]}],"abstract":"The DFT-SOFDM is a high date rate underwater acoustic transmission scheme even for underwater military communication. It has been widely studied to overcome the complexity of underwater acoustic channels. Generally speaking, multi-carrier transmission systems have many obvious advantages. They are less sensitive to impulsive noise than single-carrier systems. The longer symbol duration provides an advantage in a presence of impulsive noise. Nevertheless, it was recently recognized that this advantage turns into a disadvantage, if the impulsive noise energy exceeds a certain threshold. In this paper, nonlinearity methods for impulsive noise suppression in DFT-SOFDM receivers are considered. The experimental results of this comparative study show that the blanking nonlinearity performs better than the clipping nonlinearity.","doi":"10.1109/ICTM.2009.5412958","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Test and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Test and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405663/5412875/05412958.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTM.2009.5412958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulsive noise suppression in DFT-SOFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5412958/","displayDocTitle":"Impulsive noise suppression in DFT-SOFDM system","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11220425","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5412958/","conferenceDate":"5-6 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulsive noise suppression in DFT-SOFDM system","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05528S","chronDate":"5-6 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405663","isNumber":"5412875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405663","xplore-issue":"5412875","articleId":"5412958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5412971,"authors":[{"name":"Yanbin Sun","affiliation":["College of Information, Hebei Polytechnic University, Tangshan, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Yanbin Sun","id":"37404470800"},{"name":"Yi An","affiliation":["Group of Logistics, Hebei Polytechnic University, Tangshan, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Yi An","id":"37391668200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4699-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-5592"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-5606"}],"articleNumber":"5412971","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5412971","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Pickling","Neural networks","Milling machines","Mathematical model","Monitoring","Servomechanisms","Valves","Production systems","Personnel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cold rolling","computerised monitoring","condition monitoring","electric drives","fault diagnosis","neural nets","pickling (materials processing)","production engineering computing","production equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis system","pickling","cold-rolling electric drives","BP neural network","on-line monitoring","electro-hydraulic servo valve"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP neural network","pickling","cold-rolling","electric drive","fault diagnosis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTM.2009.5412971","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405663/5412875/05412971.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Test and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Test and Measurement","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTM.2009.5412971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research of fault diagnosis system for pickling and cold-rolling electric drives based on BP neural network","abstract":"The Paper has exploited a system of on-line monitoring and fault diagnosis for pickling and cold-rolling electric drives, making use of configuration technologies, Matlab simulation tools and BP neural network.

Also, sub-threshold circuits are becoming more popular. At the same time, the reliability of VLSI systems has become a major concern under Single Event Upsets (SEUs). SEUs are very problematic even for circuits operating at nominal voltages. With the increasing demand for low power reliable systems, it is therefore necessary to harden DVS and sub-threshold circuits efficiently. In this paper, we perform 3D simulations of radiation particle strikes in an inverter implemented using DVS and sub-threshold design. We analyze the sensitivity of the inverter to radiation particle strikes by varying the inverter size, the inverter load, the supply voltage (VDD) and the energy of the radiation particles. From these 3D simulations, we make several observations which are important to consider during radiation hardening of DVS and sub-threshold circuits. Based on these observations, we propose several guidelines for radiation hardening of DVS and sub-threshold circuit designs. These guidelines suggest that the traditional radiation hardening approaches need to be revisited for DVS and sub-threshold designs. We also propose a charge collection model for DVS circuits. Our model can accurately estimate (with an average error of 6.3%) the charge collected at the output of a gate for different supply voltages and different gate sizes for medium and high energy particle strikes.

There has been a lot of research in the area of FFT algorithm implementation; most of the research is focused on reduction of the computational complexity by selection and efficient decomposition of the FFT algorithm. However there has not been much research on using the CORDIC structures for FFT implementations, especially for large, high speed and high throughput FFT transforms, due to the recursive nature of the CORDIC algorithms. The key ideas in this paper are replacing the sine and cosine twiddle factors in the conventional FFT architecture by non-iterative CORDIC micro-rotations which allow substantial (~50%) reduction in read-only memory (ROM) table size, and total removal of complex multipliers. A new method to derive the optimal unrolling/unfolding factor for a desired FFT application based on the MSE (mean square error) is also proposed in this paper. Implemented on a Virtex-4 FPGA, the CORDIC based FFT runs 3.9 times faster and occupies 37% less area than an equivalent complex multiplier-based FFT implementation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","digital arithmetic","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","mean square error methods","read-only storage","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT algorithm","CORDIC structures","computational complexity","sine cosine twiddle factor","cosine twiddle factor","read-only memory table size","MSE","mean square error","Virtex-4 FPGA","complex multiplier","fast Fourier transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413113","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413113","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413113.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413113","startPage":"485","endPage":"490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high throughput FFT processor with no multipliers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high throughput FFT processor with no multipliers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413113/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413113/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139701","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high throughput FFT processor with no multipliers","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"485Abdulla.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052281S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413119,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401324800"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5029-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5028-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5413119","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413119","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Microfluidics","Electrodes","Benchmark testing","Voltage control","Algorithm design and analysis","Equations","Compaction","Dynamic programming","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","biomolecular electronics","drops","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast routability","performance-driven droplet routing","digital microfluidic biochip","design complexity","DMFB design","global moving vector analysis","entropy-based equation","routing order","routing compaction","dynamic programming","routing completion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413119","endPage":"450","startPage":"445","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast routability- and performance-driven droplet routing algorithm for digital microfluidic biochips","abstract":"As the microfluidic technology advances, the design complexity of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFB) are expected to explode in the near future. One of the most critical challenges for DMFB design is the droplet routing problem, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner. In this paper, we propose a fast routability- and performance-driven droplet router for DMFBs. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a global moving vector analysis for constructing preferred routing tracks to minimize the number of used unit cells; (2) an entropy-based equation to determine the routing order of droplets for better routability; (3) a routing compaction technique by dynamic programming to minimize the latest arrival time of droplets. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves 100% routing completion for all test cases on three Benchmark Suites while the previous algorithms are not. In addition to routability, compared with the state-of-the-art high-performance routing on the Benchmark Suite I (Cho and Pan, 2008), the experimental results still show that our algorithm performed better in runtime by 40%, reduced the latest arrival time by 21%, reduced the used unit cells by 10%. Furthermore, experiment results on Benchmark Suite II and III are also very promising. Based on the evaluation of three Benchmark Suites, our algorithm demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of handling complex droplet routing problem over the existing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413119/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413119/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11139707","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A fast routability- and performance-driven droplet routing algorithm for digital microfluidic biochips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast routability- and performance-driven droplet routing algorithm for digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"445Huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088161S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5413120,"authors":[{"name":"Rance Rodrigues","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Rance","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37411595900"},{"name":"Aswin Sreedhar","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Aswin","lastName":"Sreedhar","id":"37410503700"},{"name":"Sandip Kundu","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37276072500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5029-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5028-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5413120","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lithography","Wavelet transforms","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Image motion analysis","Optical design","Process design","Manufacturing processes","Design for manufacture","Optical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design for manufacture","optimisation","photolithography","semiconductor technology","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D wavelet transform","optical lithography simulation","design for manufacturability","aerial imaging simulation","optimization methods","polygon edge detection improvement","coherent decomposition method"]}],"abstract":"Optical lithography is an indispensible step in the process flow of design for manufacturability (DFM). Optical lithography simulation is a compute intensive task and simulation performance, or lack thereof can be a determining factor in time to market. Thus, the efficiency of lithography simulation is of paramount importance. Coherent decomposition is a popular simulation technique for aerial imaging simulation. In this paper, we propose an approximate simulation technique based on the 2D wavelet transform and use a number of optimization methods to further improve polygon edge detection. Results show that the proposed method suffers from an average error of less than 5% when compared with the coherent decomposition method. The benefits of the proposed method are (i) >10X increase in performance and more importantly (ii) it allows very large circuits to be simulated while some commercial tools are severely capacity limited. Approximate simulation is quite attractive for layout optimization where it may be used in a loop and may even be acceptable for final layout verification.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413120","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413120.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical lithography simulation using wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413120/","displayDocTitle":"Optical lithography simulation using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139708","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413120/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical lithography simulation using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"427Rodrigues.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077002S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5413122,"authors":[{"name":"Chun He","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronic Science & Tech, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"He","id":"37401894700"},{"name":"Alexandros Papakonstantinou","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Papakonstantinou","id":"37396562200"},{"name":"Deming Chen","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Deming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37274186500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5029-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5028-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5413122","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":927},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel SoC architecture on FPGA for ultra fast face detection","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413122.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"418","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413122","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Face detection","Computer architecture","Parallel processing","Artificial neural networks","Video surveillance","Robot vision systems","Biometrics","Authentication","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","face recognition","field programmable gate arrays","neural nets","object detection","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SoC architecture","ultra fast face detection","system on chip","video surveillance","robotic vision","biometric authentication","artificial neural network classifiers","AdaBoost trained Haar features","feature extraction","Xilinx FX130T Virtex5 FPGA device","SSE-optimized software implementation","frequency 2.4 GHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413122","abstract":"Face detection is the cornerstone of a wide range of applications such as video surveillance, robotic vision and biometric authentication.

However aggressive voltage scaling can introduce errors in the output signal, thus degrading the algorithmic performance of the circuit. We consider the specific case of the finite impulse response (FIR) filter, and identify two different sources of errors occurring due to voltage scaling: (a) errors introduced because of increased delay along the logic path and (b) errors caused by failures in the memory due to process variations. We design a FIR filter by using a simple feedback based approach to reduce the memory errors and a linear predictor structure for correcting the logic errors. The proposed filter is more robust to both logic and memory errors caused by voltage scaling.

Recently, two/three transistor one gated-diode (2T/3T1D) DRAMs were proposed as alternatives to address the SRAM variability problem, with an emphasis on high-activity embedded cache applications. They are highly competitive with an SRAM in terms of performance, while having a smaller power and area footprint at lower technology nodes. The current evolutionary trend in transistor structures is toward an era of multi-gate devices, which makes it necessary to identify design issues and advantages of gated-diode DRAMs implemented in a multi-gate technology. In this work, we address gated-diode DRAM design in FinFET technology using mixed-mode 2D-device simulations. We revisit the model of internal voltage gain in bulk gated-diodes and extend it to provide quantitative insight into designing Fin gated-diodes, i.e., gated-diodes in FinFET technology. To this effect, we propose FinFET variants of the bulk gated-diode configuration and identify parameters that are critical to enhancing the retention time and read current in 2T/3T1D FinFET DRAMs. Additionally, we show the superiority of 2T1D FinFET DRAM over 6T FinFET SRAM having pass-gate feedback (6T PGFB) and 2T1D bulk DRAM under the effect of variations using a quasi-Monte Carlo method implemented in FinE, an environment we have developed for double-gate circuit design that integrates Sentaurus TCAD from Synopsys with the Spice3-UFDG double-gate compact model from University of Florida under a single framework. Finally, we present a new tunable threshold gated-diode FinFET amplifier which uses an n-type gated-diode for voltage-boosting, along with a p-type gated-diode for zero-suppression.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413127","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413127.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Pragmatic design of gated-diode FinFET DRAMs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139715","htmlLink":"/document/5413127/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pragmatic design of gated-diode FinFET DRAMs","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"390Bhoj.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099865S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413129,"authors":[{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"},{"name":"Tae-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406592400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5029-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5028-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5413129","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear approximation","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Very large scale integration","Viterbi algorithm","Logic arrays","Digital signal processing","Maximum likelihood estimation","Decoding","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplier-less linear approximation","table-less linear approximation","digital signal processing algorithms","digital communication algorithms","hardware complexity","square-root functions","VLSI systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413129","abstract":"Square and square-root are widely used in digital signal processing and digital communication algorithms, and their efficient realizations are commonly required to reduce the hardware complexity.

The traditional linear approximations need multipliers to calculate slope offsets and tables to store initial offset values and slope values, whereas the proposed approximations exploit the inherent properties of square-related functions to linearly interpolate with only simple operations, such as shift, concatenation and addition, which are usually supported in modern VLSI systems.

Most of these are non-volatile in nature, and compared to SRAM, they are often denser, just as fast, and have much lower energy consumption. Using 3-D stacking technology, it has been proposed that they can be used instead of SRAM in large level 2 caches prevalent in today's microprocessors. However, one of the key challenges in the use of these technologies, such as MRAM, is their higher fault probabilities arising from the larger process variation, defects in its fabrication, and the fact that the cache is much larger. This seriously affect yield. In this paper, we propose a fault resilient set associative cache architecture which we called the salvage cache. In the salvage cache, a faulty cache block is sacrificed and used to repair faults found in other blocks. We will describe in detail the architecture of the salvage cache as well as provide results of yield simulations that show that a much higher yield can be achieved viz-a-viz other fault tolerant techniques. We will also show the performance savings that arise from the use of a large next-generation L2 cache.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413145.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413145","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The salvage cache: A fault-tolerant cache architecture for next-generation memory technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The salvage cache: A fault-tolerant cache architecture for next-generation memory technologies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413145/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5413145/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139733","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The salvage cache: A fault-tolerant cache architecture for next-generation memory technologies","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"268Koh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070951S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413166,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Michel Chabloz","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, School of ICT, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jean-Michel","lastName":"Chabloz","id":"37395373900"},{"name":"Ahmed Hemani","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, School of ICT, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Hemani","id":"37265609900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5029-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5028-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5413166","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":129},"abstract":"As a replacement for the fast-fading Globally-Synchronous model, we have defined a flexible design style for SoCs, called GRLS, for Globally-Ratiochronous, Locally-Synchronous, which does not rely on global synchronization and is based on using rationally-related clock frequencies derived from the same source.

The validity of the method and its resistance to non-idealities such as jitter, misalignments and clock drifts are formally proven while experimental results including overhead are presented for 90 nm technology. Despite allowing much greater flexibility, the overhead of our method is comparable to that of state-of-the-art mesochronous communication techniques.

Therefore, it is critical to detect these faults during factory test. Testing for a delay fault requires the application of a pair of test vectors in an at-speed manner. To maximize the delay fault detection capability, it is desired that the vectors in this pair are independent. Independent vector pairs cannot always be applied to a circuit implemented with standard scan design approaches. However, this can be achieved by using enhanced scan flip-flops, which store two bits of data. This paper has two contributions. First, we develop a pulsed flip-flop (PFF) design. Second, we present an enhanced scan flipflop design, based on our PFF circuit. We have compared the performance of our pulse based flip-flop with recently published pulse based flip-flop designs, as well as a traditional master-slave D flip-flop. Our PFF shows significant improvements in power and timing compared to the other designs. Our pulse based enhanced scan flip-flop (PESFF) has 13% lower power dissipation and 26% better timing than a conventional D flipflop based enhanced scan flip-flop (DESFF). The layout area of our PESFF is 5.2% smaller than the DESFF. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our design is more robust to process variations than the DESFF.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413168","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413168.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","startPage":"97","endPage":"102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust pulsed flip-flop and its use in enhanced scan design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A robust pulsed flip-flop and its use in enhanced scan design","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413168/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139756","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5413168/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust pulsed flip-flop and its use in enhanced scan design","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"097Kumar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05784S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413169,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37289905800"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404297700"},{"name":"Jyothi B.

Yet the difficulty in the integration of on-chip inductors still limits its application in practice. This paper resolves such a key issue with sub-50 \u00bfm magnetic inductors, which are fully compatible with the CMOS process. These inductors leverage soft magnetic coils to achieve inductances up to 4nH, Q-factor of 3 at 1 GHz with a device diameter of only 30-50 \u00bfm, resulting in area savings of nearly 100X as compared to conventional design. The latency and noise performance of the resonant clock network is demonstrated to be comparable to those using conventional inductors without soft magnetic materials. In addition, inductors with integrated magnetic materials significantly reduce mutual coupling and eddy current loss in the power grid below the clock network. These design advantages enable high density of on-chip distributed oscillators, providing better phase averaging, lower power and superior noise characteristics as compared to traditional buffer-tree based clock network.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413169","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413169.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling resonant clock distribution with scaled on-chip magnetic inductors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enabling resonant clock distribution with scaled on-chip magnetic inductors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11139757","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413169/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413169/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling resonant clock distribution with scaled on-chip magnetic inductors","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"103Sinha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047776S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5413183,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309060400"},{"name":"Kenneth S.

However, most asynchronous circuits or protocols cannot be proven conformant to a specification without adding timing assumptions. Relative Timing (RT) is an approach to model and verify circuits and protocols that require timing assumptions to operate correctly. The process of creating path-based RT constraints has previously been done by hand with the aid of a formal verification engine. This time consuming and error prone method vastly restricts the application of RT and the capability to implement circuits and protocols. This paper describes an algorithm for automatic generation of RT constraints based on signal traces generated from a formal verification (FV) engine that supports relative timing constraints. This algorithm has been implemented in a CAD tool called Automatic Relative Timing Identifier based on Signal Traces (ARTIST) which has been embedded into the FV engine. A set of asynchronous and clocked designs and protocols have been verified and proven to be hazard-free with the RT constraints generated by ARTIST which would have taken months to perform by hand. A comparison of RT constraints between hand-generated and ARTIST generated constraints is also described in terms of efficiency and quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139771","htmlLink":"/document/5413183/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic synthesis of computation interference constraints for relative timing verification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic synthesis of computation interference constraints for relative timing verification","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"016Xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06855S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5413185,"authors":[{"name":"Nada Amin","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Nada","lastName":"Amin","id":"37409407100"},{"name":"William Thies","affiliation":["Microsoft Research India, India"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Thies","id":"37282559200"},{"name":"Saman Amarasinghe","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Saman","lastName":"Amarasinghe","id":"37273317200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5029-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5028-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5413185","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":540},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413185","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design automation","Microfluidics","Nonhomogeneous media","Soft lithography","Automatic control","Instruction sets","Valves","Pressure control","Actuators","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","instruction sets","microfluidics","printed circuits","soft lithography","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer-aided design","microfluidic chips","multilayer soft lithography","lab-on-a-chip","droplet based devices","design automation techniques","instruction set architecture","routing valves","AutoCAD","Micado","control layer","pressure actuators"]}],"abstract":"Microfluidic chips are emerging as a powerful platform for automating biology experiments. As it becomes possible to integrate tens of thousands of components on a single chip, researchers will require design automation tools to push the scale and complexity of their designs to match the capabilities of the substrate. However, to date such tools have focused only on droplet-based devices, leaving out the popular class of chips that are based on multilayer soft lithography. In this paper, we develop design automation techniques for microfluidic chips based on multilayer soft lithography. We focus our attention on the control layer, which is driven by pressure actuators to invoke the desired flows on chip. We present a language in which designers can specify the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of a microfluidic device. Given an ISA, we automatically infer the locations of valves needed to implement the ISA. We also present novel algorithms for minimizing the number of control lines needed to drive the valves, as well as for routing valves to control ports while admitting sharing between the control lines. To the microfluidic community, we offer a free computer-aided design tool, Micado, which implements a subset of our algorithms as a practical plug-in to AutoCAD. Micado is being used successfully by microfluidic designers. We demonstrate its performance on three realistic chips.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413185","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406656/5413104/05413185.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2009.5413185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided design for microfluidic chips based on multilayer soft lithography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided design for microfluidic chips based on multilayer soft lithography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139773","htmlLink":"/document/5413185/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided design for microfluidic chips based on multilayer soft lithography","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"002Thies.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057654S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406656","isNumber":"5413104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406656","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5413104","articleId":"5413185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413209,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo J.

However, their implementation is typically based on individual architectures, unable of being reconfigured with different instruments/modules usually required by every experiment. In this paper, we discuss practical guidelines for implementing reconfigurable weblabs that support both local and remote control interfaces. The underlying infrastructure is based on reconfigurable, low-cost, FPGA-based boards supporting several peripherals that are used for the local interface. The remote interface is powered by a module capable of communicating with an Ethernet based network and that can either correspond to an internal core of the FPGA or an external device. These two approaches are discussed in the paper, followed by a practical implementation example.","doi":"10.1109/ICELIE.2009.5413209","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Conference on E-Learning in Industrial Electronics (ICELIE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Conference on E-Learning in Industrial Electronics (ICELIE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405662/5413192/05413209.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELIE.2009.5413209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based weblab infrastructures guidelines and a prototype implementation example","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413209/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based weblab infrastructures guidelines and a prototype implementation example","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11138865","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413209/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based weblab infrastructures guidelines and a prototype implementation example","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0057if000485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080051S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405662","isNumber":"5413192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405662","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5413192","articleId":"5413209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5413228,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00e9mi Dubroca","affiliation":["ISITV, LSEET UMR-CNRS 6017, University of Sud Toulon Var, La Valette-du-Var, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Dubroca","id":"37396582000"},{"name":"Christophe De Luigi","affiliation":["ISITV, LSEET UMR-CNRS 6017, University of Sud Toulon Var, La Valette-du-Var, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"De Luigi","id":"37328841000"},{"name":"Eric Moreau","affiliation":["ISITV, LSEET UMR-CNRS 6017, University of Sud Toulon Var, La Valette-du-Var, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Moreau","id":"37284223800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5179-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5180-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5413228","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Source separation","Tensile stress","Blind source separation","Algebra","Statistics","Reactive power","Computer simulation","Iterative algorithms","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convolution","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PARAFAC decomposition","blind source separation","MIMO convolutive mixture","sequential separation scheme","extraction filter","fixed point method","parallel factor decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind Source Separation","Higher Order Statistics","PARAFAC Decomposition"]}],"abstract":"The paper deals with the problem of blind source separation after a MIMO convolutive mixture.

Simulation results show that the higher-order methods improve the detection performance and also reduce the complexity for large-scale networks.","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413230","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413230.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Higher-Order PCA for anomaly detection in large-scale networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413230/","displayDocTitle":"Higher-Order PCA for anomaly detection in large-scale networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140338","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413230/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Higher-Order PCA for anomaly detection in large-scale networks","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p85kim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064373S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413231,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitri Nion","affiliation":["Group Science Engineering and Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Nion","id":"37294571700"},{"name":"Lieven De Lathauwer","affiliation":["Group Science Engineering and Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lieven","lastName":"De Lathauwer","id":"37294570700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5179-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5180-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5413231","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Argon","Closed-form solution","Least squares approximation","Matrix decomposition","Conferences","Iterative algorithms","Multiaccess communication","Source separation","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","code division multiple access","iterative methods","optimisation","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["third-order tensor","joint block diagonalization","component decomposition","iterative optimization algorithms","blind CDMA signal separation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413231","abstract":"In this paper, we show that the block component decomposition in rank-(L,L,1) terms of a third-order tensor, referred to as BCD-(L,L,1), can be reformulated as a joint block diagonalization (JBD) problem, provided that certain assumptions on the dimensions are satisfied. This JBD-based reformulation leads to a new uniqueness bound for the BCD-(L,L,1). We also propose a closed-form solution to solve exact JBD problems.

We assume a network with m nodes each observing an i.i.d. Gaussian source; the nodes communicate and perform local processing with the goal of computing the average of the sources to within a prescribed mean squared error distortion. A general cutset lower bound on the network rate distortion function is established and shown to be achievable to within a factor of 2 via a centralized protocol in the star network. A lower bound on the network rate distortion function for distributed weighted-sum protocols that is larger than the cutset bound by a factor of log m is established. We also establish an upper bound on the expected network rate distortion function for gossip-based weighted-sum protocols that is only a factor of log log m larger than this lower bound. The results suggest that using distributed protocols results in a factor of log m increase in communication relative to centralized protocols.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadratic Gaussian gossiping","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413234","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413234.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quadratic Gaussian gossiping","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413234/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadratic Gaussian gossiping","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p69su.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040509S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413235,"authors":[{"name":"Cesar F.

The channel is modeled by incorporating antenna correlation at the BS. In contrast to the perfect CSI case where instantaneous MSE duality is considered, the average mean square error (AMSE) duality is exploited. To show the application of our AMSE duality we consider the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transceiver design for the downlink multiuser MIMO systems. Our objective is to minimize the sum MSE constrained with a total BS power and provide robustness against channel uncertainties. In the uplink channel, the power allocation part of this problem is formulated as a geometric program (GP). Based on the solution of GP and the AMSE duality analysis, we propose an iterative algorithm that performs optimization alternatively between the uplink and the downlink channels.

Following the linear mixing model, each pixel spectrum of the hyperspectral image is decomposed as a linear combination of pure endmember spectra. The estimation of the unknown endmember spectra and the corresponding abundances is conducted in a unified manner by generating the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters under a hierarchical Bayesian model. The proposed model accounts for non-negativity and full-additivity constraints, and exploits the fact that the endmember spectra lie on a lower dimensional space.

We consider solving a blind identification problem based on JD, where at least one of the matrices under JD is positive definite. We then compare two methods to solve the problem: The first method consists of the so-called Hard-Whitening (HW) followed by orthogonal JD (OJD), and the second method is based on non-orthogonal JD (NOJD). We identify a bias-variance trade-off in this problem, and argue that there is a region depending on the noise level, the number of sources and the number of (statistics) matrices used in the JD process, where the method based on OJD can have less estimation error than the one based on NOJD, while the former always has higher estimation bias than the latter. Simulations support the arguments presented. We also report a constraint proposed in the literature which might be helpful in finding a good trade-off point between bias and variance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bias-variance dilemma in Joint Diagonalization and Blind Source Separation","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413266","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413266.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A bias-variance dilemma in Joint Diagonalization and Blind Source Separation","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413266/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140374","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bias-variance dilemma in Joint Diagonalization and Blind Source Separation","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p324afsari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066345S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5413271,"authors":[{"name":"Arie Yeredor","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Arie","lastName":"Yeredor","id":"37283864600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5179-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5180-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5413271","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source separation","Symmetric matrices","Maximum likelihood estimation","Equations","Statistics","Conferences","Iterative methods","Blind source separation","Virtual manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","Gaussian processes","higher order statistics","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid exact-approximate joint diagonalization","classical approximate joint diagonalization problem","maximum likelihood source separation","second-order statistics","Gaussian sources","joint diagonality criterion","positive-definite target-matrices","blind source separation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413271","abstract":"We consider a particular form of the classical approximate joint diagonalization problem, often encountered in maximum likelihood source separation based on second-order statistics with Gaussian sources.

These SNR expressions are first used to study the near-far robustness by analyzing their asymptotic behavior when the signal from one of the users is significantly stronger than the signal received from the other terminal. Subsequently we demonstrate how to achieve individual SNR targets for both terminals via a combined strategy of user power control and the algebraic norm-maximizing (ANOMAX) transmit strategy at the relay. We also derive a simple necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee that the region of achievable SNR targets is convex.

Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to identify the time delays of the multipath components. However, these methods require high sampling rates. In this paper, we develop a unified approach to time delay estimation from low rate samples of the output of a multipath medium. Our approach results in a sampling theorem for analog signals defined over an infinite union of subspaces. The proposed method leads to perfect recovery of the multipath delays from samples of the channel output at the lowest possible rate, which depends only on the number of multipath components and the transmission rate, and not on the bandwidth of the probing signal. By properly manipulating the low-rate samples, we show that the time delays can be recovered using the well-known ESPRIT algorithm. Combining results from sampling theory with those obtained in the context of direction of arrival estimation methods, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions on the transmitted pulse and the sampling functions in order to ensure perfect recovery of the channel parameters at the minimal possible rate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413300","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413300.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"204","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath medium identification using efficient sampling schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multipath medium identification using efficient sampling schemes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5413300/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140408","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413300/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath medium identification using efficient sampling schemes","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p201gedalyahu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055014S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5413301,"authors":[{"name":"Yue M.

As an emerging topic MIMO radar doesn't have an IEEE definition and if taken literally includes many techniques that have existed much longer than the term itself. In this paper we set MIMO in the context of diversity sensing and draw on the physical interpretation implied by differing concepts to explain expected performance. In this way we present MIMO and related techniques as new and largely unexplored series of radar system design freedoms that offer additional capability. This provides a powerful new paradigm based on diversity for future radar sensors with enormous potential when combined with cognitive processing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413307.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar: From a different perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Frequency","Speckle","Radar cross section","Polarization","Radar imaging","Clutter","Object detection","Synthetic aperture radar","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","radar system design","radar sensors","cognitive processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar: From a different perspective","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413307/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140415","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar: From a different perspective","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p185baker.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036317S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413310,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292963000"},{"name":"Rick S.

In this paper, we revisit an earlier examined MIMO radar waveform design problem which optimizes both minimum mean-square error estimation (MMSE) and mutual information (MI). We formulate a new waveform design problem and provide some further results, which complement the previous study. More specifically, we present an iterative optimization algorithm based on the alternating projection method, to determine waveform solutions that can simultaneously satisfy a structure constraint and optimize the design criteria. Numerical examples are provided, which illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, we find that the waveform solutions obtained through our proposed algorithm can achieve very close and virtually indistinguishable performance from that predicted in the previous study.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413310.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"172","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternating projection for MIMO radar waveform design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar","Design optimization","Constraint optimization","Iterative algorithms","Surges","Estimation error","Mutual information","Iterative methods","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO radar","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar waveform design","multiple-input multiple-output radar","minimum mean-square error estimation","mutual information","MMSE","iterative optimization algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Alternating projection for MIMO radar waveform design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413310/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140418","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternating projection for MIMO radar waveform design","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p169yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072428S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413311,"authors":[{"name":"Satyabrata Sen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Satyabrata","lastName":"Sen","id":"37411627200"},{"name":"Arye Nehorai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Arye","lastName":"Nehorai","id":"37265777100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5179-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5180-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5413311","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar tracking","OFDM","MIMO","Mutual information","Target tracking","Polarization","Algorithm design and analysis","Frequency diversity","Signal resolution","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","target tracking","telecommunication signalling","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM MIMO radar design","low-angle tracking","information theoretic waveform design algorithm","target tracking","co-located multiple-input-multiple-output radar","wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signalling scheme","frequency diversity","polarization-sensitive transceivers","scattering coefficients","sequential Monte Carlo method","particle filter","optimal waveform design technique","mutual information criterion","adaptive waveform design"]}],"abstract":"We develop an information theoretic waveform design algorithm for target tracking in the presence of multipath.

The lower bound on the MSE is derived for the joint estimation of the vector of unknown parameters, consisting of the target location and the mismatch of the allegedly known system parameters, i.e., phase offsets at the radars. Synchronization errors are modeled as being random and Gaussian. A closed-form expression for the hybrid CRB is derived for the case of orthogonal waveforms. The bound on the target localization MSE is expressed as the sum of two terms, the first represents the CRB with no phase mismatch, and the second captures the mismatch effect. The latter is shown to depend on the phase error variance, the number of mismatched transmitting and receiving sensors and the system geometry. For a given phase synchronization error variance, this expression offers the means to analyze the achievable localization accuracy. Alternatively, for a predetermined localization MSE target value, the derived expression may be used to determine the necessary phase synchronization level in the distributed system.","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413314","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of phase synchronization mismatch sensitivity for coherent MIMO radar systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of phase synchronization mismatch sensitivity for coherent MIMO radar systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413314/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140422","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5413314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of phase synchronization mismatch sensitivity for coherent MIMO radar systems","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p153godrich.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04146S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413317,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00e9my Boyer","affiliation":["Laboratiore des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes (L2S, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud XI, CNRS, SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9my","lastName":"Boyer","id":"37330520400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5179-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5180-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5413317","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar antennas","Background noise","Clutter","Spaceborne radar","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Reflector antennas","Stochastic processes","Doppler radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","encoding","MIMO radar","radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colocated MIMO radar","orthogonal waveform coding","closed form expression analysis","structured noise","clutter echoes","background noise","multiple-input multiple-output radar system","multiple antennas","noncoherent orthogonal waveforms","radar station","moving target velocity estimation","single-input multiple-output radar","SIMO radar","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we derive and analyze closed form (nonmatrix) expression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for the location and the velocity of moving targets contaminated by a structured noise (clutter echoes) and a background noise.

Moreover, we obtain a general beamforming structure at the relay node, which is optimal for any objective functions, e.g., transmission rate, mean-square-error (MSE), bit-error-rate (BER), etc.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413326.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"112","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On communication protocol and beamforming design for amplify-and-forward N-way relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Relays","Peer to peer computing","Tin","Conferences","Computer networks","Wireless application protocol","Jacobian matrices","Data engineering","Constraint theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","least mean squares methods","protocols","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication protocol","beamforming design","amplify-and-forward N-way relay networks","wireless relay network","bit-error-rate","transmission rate","mean-square-error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["N-way relay","amplify-and-forward","beamforming","optimal design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On communication protocol and beamforming design for amplify-and-forward N-way relay networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413326/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140434","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On communication protocol and beamforming design for amplify-and-forward N-way relay networks","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p109gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074609S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413327,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Taheri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Taheri","id":"37400370800"},{"name":"Sergiy A.

We consider the problem of the total transmit power minimization subject to two constraints that maintain the transceivers' SNRs above given thresholds \u00bf\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and \u00bf\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n. For this problem, we obtain a semi-closed-form solution for the beamforming weight vector. Our solution is based on the observation that beamforming weight vector depends on the sum of SNR thresholds \u00bf\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n + \u00bf\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n. As long as this sum does not change, the beamforming weight vector will not change.

Based on this equivalent one-way relaying scheme, the beamforming weight vector is obtained in a closed form if a certain intermediate parameter is given. This parameter is the transmit power of the source in the equivalent one-way relaying scheme and can be obtained efficiently using a simple bisection method. Once this parameter is obtained, the beamforming weight vector can be obtained in a closed form.","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413328","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413328.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413328","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","startPage":"101","endPage":"104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A semi-closed-form solution to optimal decentralized beamforming for two-way relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A semi-closed-form solution to optimal decentralized beamforming for two-way relay networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413328/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413328/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140436","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A semi-closed-form solution to optimal decentralized beamforming for two-way relay networks","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p101shahbazpanahi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063955S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5413329,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Abdelkader","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Abdelkader","id":"37398898900"},{"name":"Shahram Shahbazpanahi","affiliation":["University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Shahbazpanahi","id":"37273468400"},{"name":"Alex Gershman","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Gershman","id":"37273469600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5179-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5180-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5413329","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Relays","OFDM","Intersymbol interference","Multipath channels","Propagation delay","Councils","Costs","Conferences","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","delays","intersymbol interference","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radio networks","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint subcarrier power loading","distributed beamforming","OFDM-based asynchronous relay networks","propagation delays","intersymbol interference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","amplify-and-forward operation","multipath channel network","channel impulse response","max-min fair design approach","signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous relay networks","cooperative communications","network beamforming"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider an asynchronous relay network where different relaying paths are subject to different propagation delays thus causing inter-symbol-interference (ISI) at the destination. To eliminate such an ISI, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is deployed at the source and destination but not at the relays. In fact each relay performs a simple amplify-and-forward operation: it multiply its received signal with a complex coefficient. We model such a network as a multipath channel where the equivalent channel impulse response can be carefully adjusted through optimal design of the complex relay weights. Based on this model, we use a max-min fair design approach where the smallest of the subcarrier SNRs is maximized subject to individual constraints on the source and relay transmit powers. Our numerical results show that the proposed asynchronous scheme achieves SNRs which are only 2 dB lower than those achieved by the synchronous scheme where the relays perfectly compensate their corresponding delays.","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413329","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407636/5413223/05413329.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2009.5413329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint subcarrier power loading and distributed beamforming in OFDM-based asynchronous relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413329/","displayDocTitle":"Joint subcarrier power loading and distributed beamforming in OFDM-based asynchronous relay networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140437","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413329/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint subcarrier power loading and distributed beamforming in OFDM-based asynchronous relay networks","confLoc":"Aruba, Netherland Antilles","sourcePdf":"p105abdelkader.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048462S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5407636","isNumber":"5413223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5407636","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5413223","articleId":"5413329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413365,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Henschel","affiliation":["Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Henschel","id":"37397551000"},{"name":"Wei Lee Woon","affiliation":["Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Wei Lee","lastName":"Woon","id":"37395145600"},{"name":"Thomas W\u00e4chter","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"W\u00e4chter","id":"37301010600"},{"name":"Stuart Madnick","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Madnick","id":"37268793600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5700-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5698-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5699-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5413365","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Taxonomy","Iterative algorithms","Databases","Biomedical measurements","Ontologies","Benchmark testing","Frequency","Mesh generation","Gold","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","filtering theory","graph theory","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generality based algorithm variant","automatic taxonomy generation","Heymann algorithm","variant complexity","systematic threshold evaluation","betweenness centrality","unweighted similarity graph","threshold fine-tuning","closeness centrality","entropy-based filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IIT.2009.5413365","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405659/5413354/05413365.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIT.2009.5413365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of generality based algorithm variants for automatic taxonomy generation","abstract":"We compare a family of algorithms for the automatic generation of taxonomies by adapting the Heymann-algorithm in various ways.

By means of simulations we report that the accuracy can be increased significantly, making this approach interesting for further investigations.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413382","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1596","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413382.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of nonlinear filtering and confidence information on optical flow estimation in a Lucas & Kanade framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The impact of nonlinear filtering and confidence information on optical flow estimation in a Lucas & Kanade framework","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413382/","accessionNumber":"11141778","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413382/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of nonlinear filtering and confidence information on optical flow estimation in a Lucas & Kanade framework","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048141S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413383,"authors":[{"name":"Ka-Man Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Ka-Man Wong","id":"37278688500"},{"name":"Lai-Man Po","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Lai-Man Po","id":"37270836200"},{"name":"Kwok-Wai Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, CHU, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Kwok-Wai Cheung","id":"38181907500"},{"name":"Ka-Ho Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Ka-Ho Ng","id":"37291984900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413383","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Video coding","Parameter estimation","Video compression","Video codecs","Accuracy","Computer science","Educational institutions","Computer science education","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","motion compensation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block-matching translation","zoom motion-compensated prediction","sub-sampling","video coding standards","video compression","multiple reference frames","camera zooming","object motions","video frames"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Coding","Motion Compensated Prediction","Translation and Zoom Motion"]}],"abstract":"In modern video coding standards, motion compensated prediction (MCP) plays a key role to achieve video compression efficiency. Most of them make use of block matching techniques and assume the motions are pure translational. Some attempts toward a more general motion model usually too complex to be practical in near future. In this paper, a new Block-Matching Translation and Zoom Motion-Compensated Prediction (BTZMP) is proposed to extend the pure translational model to a more general model with zooming in a practical way. It adopts the camera zooming and object motions that becomes zooming while projected on the video frames. The proposed BTZMP significantly improve motion compensated prediction. Experimental results show that BTZMP can give prediction gain up to 1.09dB compared to conventional sub-pixel block-matching MCP. In addition, BTZMP can be incorporated with Multiple Reference Frames (MRF) technique to give extra improvement, evidentially by the prediction gain ranging up to 2.08dB in the empirical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Matching Translation And Zoom Motion-Compensated Prediction by sub-sampling","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413383","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413383.pdf","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Block-Matching Translation And Zoom Motion-Compensated Prediction by sub-sampling","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413383/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141779","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Matching Translation And Zoom Motion-Compensated Prediction by sub-sampling","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059132S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413400,"authors":[{"name":"Taichi Joutou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Taichi Joutou","id":"37400415500"},{"name":"Keiji Yanai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Keiji Yanai","id":"37374951300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413400","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1650},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A food image recognition system with Multiple Kernel Learning","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413400.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"288","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413400","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Kernel","Support vector machines","Cameras","Image classification","Medical services","Prototypes","Object recognition","Support vector machine classification","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","health care","image classification","image texture","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["food image recognition system","multiple kernel learning","eating habits","image features","food image classification system","health care"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["food image","multiple kernel learning","generic object recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413400","abstract":"Since health care on foods is drawing people's attention recently, a system that can record everyday meals easily is being awaited.

We use an existing illumination normalization technique in the logarithm DCT domain. The main contribution in this paper is that we apply the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm for feature extraction in the DCT domain. By this, we skip the inverse DCT step and reduce the computational cost. Experimental results on the Yale B database show that we obtain the same results exactly as applying PCA in the spatial domain with the advantage of the reduced computational cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413447.pdf","startPage":"4157","endPage":"4160","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination invariant face recognition in logarithm Discrete Cosine Transform domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Face recognition","Discrete cosine transforms","Principal component analysis","Computational efficiency","Biometrics","Robustness","Humans","Feature extraction","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","face recognition","feature extraction","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illumination invariant face recognition","logarithm discrete cosine transform domain","principal component analysis","PCA","feature extraction","DCT","Yale B database","biometrics","automatic person identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","Discrete Cosine Transform","PCA","Logarithm transform","Illumination normalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Illumination invariant face recognition in logarithm Discrete Cosine Transform domain","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413447/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150696","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination invariant face recognition in logarithm Discrete Cosine Transform domain","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0004157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049987S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5413449,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed El Aroussi","affiliation":["LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"El Aroussi","id":"37320411800"},{"name":"Mohammed El Hassouni","affiliation":["LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"El Hassouni","id":"37320413000"},{"name":"Sanaa Ghouzali","affiliation":["LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Sanaa","lastName":"Ghouzali","id":"37320412600"},{"name":"Mohammed Rziza","affiliation":["LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Rziza","id":"37320407000"},{"name":"Driss Aboutajdine","affiliation":["LRIT, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Driss","lastName":"Aboutajdine","id":"37284909000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413449","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"abstract":"In this paper, an efficient local appearance feature extraction method based steerable pyramid (S-P) is proposed for face recognition.

This paper presents a novel palmprint based identification approach which uses the textural information available on the palmprint by employing the non subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). After establishing the region of interest (ROI), the two dimensional (2-D) spectrum is divided into fine slices, using iterated directional filter banks. Next, directional energy component for each block from the decomposed subband outputs is computed. The proposed algorithm captures both local and global details in a palmprint as a compact fixed length palm code. Palmprint matching is then performed using normalized Euclidean distance classifier. The algorithm is tested on a total of 7752 palm images, acquired from the standard database of Polytechnic University of Hong Kong. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system by exhibiting Decidability Index of 2.8125 and equal error rate of 0.1604%, better than the reported techniques in literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5413471/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141879","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Directional energy based palmprint identification using Non Subsampled Contourlet Transform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional energy based palmprint identification using Non Subsampled Contourlet Transform","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046882S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413474,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Deng","affiliation":["TNList and Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, China"],"lastName":"Yue Deng","id":"37087801225"},{"name":"Dong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dong Li","id":"37087147674"},{"name":"Xudong Xie","affiliation":["TNList and Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37307108100"},{"name":"Kin-Man Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kin-Man","lastName":"Lam","id":"37345646000"},{"name":"Qionghai Dai","affiliation":["TNList and Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, China"],"lastName":"Qionghai Dai","id":"37087072119"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413474","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":460},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413474","abstract":"This paper proposes a spectral graph based algorithm for face image repairing, which can improve the recognition performance on occluded faces.

However, contrary to fault diagnostics which is a mature research and industrial work, failure prognostics is a new field for which few applications exist. In the last decade, the interest for this activity has led to some open and industrial standards where the main objective is to provide users with a guidelines allowing them to perform failure prognostics for a large class of industrial systems. However, these standards, rightly, do not emphasize on any particular example to illustrate their content. The present paper aims at explaining the process of failure prognostics, presented in the standard ISO 13381-1, through an electromechanical example. The purpose is to help beginner researchers in the field of industrial failure prognostics to assimilate the main tasks of the process proposed by the standard. The prognostics process is chosen because it represents the key task among the rest of topics proposed and published by the standard. Thus, the comprehension of this part is important to develop prognostics methods and algorithms based on the solid recommendations given by the international organization for standardization.","doi":"10.1109/PHM.2010.5413482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2010.5413482","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405660/5413335/05413482.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ISO 13381-1 standard's failure prognostics process through an example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"The ISO 13381-1 standard's failure prognostics process through an example","conferenceDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413482/","accessionNumber":"11140873","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413482/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ISO 13381-1 standard's failure prognostics process through an example","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"MU3056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058328S","chronDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5405660","isNumber":"5413335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405660","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5413335","articleId":"5413482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":5413483,"authors":[{"name":"Sarra Sakji-Nsibi","affiliation":["Unit\u00e9 de Recherche en Imagerie Satellitaire (URISA), Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sarra","lastName":"Sakji-Nsibi","id":"38273717700"},{"name":"Amel Benazza-Benyahia","affiliation":["Unit\u00e9 de Recherche en Imagerie Satellitaire (URISA), Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Amel","lastName":"Benazza-Benyahia","id":"38272348100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413483","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image retrieval","Wavelet transforms","Indexing","Wavelet coefficients","Image coding","Wavelet domain","Hidden Markov models","Parametric statistics","Content based retrieval","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image retrieval","statistical analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copula based statistical models","multicomponent image retrieval","wavelet transform domain","multicomponent image indexing","cross-component correlations","inter-scale similarities","wavelet based retrieval system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image retrieval","wavelet transform","crosscomponent dependencies","inter-scale dependencies","copulas theory"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we are interested in multicomponent image indexing in the wavelet transform (WT) domain.

The contribution of this work consists in choosing a parametric model which reflects the main dependencies existing between the resulting coefficients consisting of cross-component correlations and inter-scale similarities. The copula concept is introduced for building an appropriate statistical model of all the wavelet coefficients.

The use of condition monitoring techniques will generally increase plant availability and reduce downtime costs, but in some cases it will also tend to over-maintaining the plant in question. There is obviously a need for appropriate decision support in plant maintenance planning utilising available condition monitoring information, but compared to the extensive literature on diagnosis, relatively little research has been done on the prognosis side of condition based maintenance. In plant prognosis, a key, but often uncertain quantity to be modelled is the residual life prediction based on available condition information to date. This paper shall focus upon such a residual life prediction of the monitored items in condition based maintenance and review the recent developments in modelling residual life prediction using stochastic filtering. We first demonstrate the role of residual life prediction in condition based maintenance decision making, which highlights the need for such a prediction. We then discuss in detail the basic filtering model we used for residual life prediction and the extensions we made. We finally present briefly the result of the comparative studies between the filtering based model and other models using empirical data. The results show that the filtering based approach is the best in terms of prediction accuracy and cost effectiveness.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Filtering","Decision making","Condition monitoring","Predictive models","Petroleum","Production","Degradation","Fault diagnosis","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","decision making","maintenance engineering","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic filtering based data driven approach","residual life prediction","residual life condition","maintenance decision making support","condition monitoring","condition based maintenance","plant prognosis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PHM.2010.5413485","publicationTitle":"2010 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405660/5413335/05413485.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2010.5413485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic filtering based data driven approach for residual life prediction and condition based maintenance decision making support","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic filtering based data driven approach for residual life prediction and condition based maintenance decision making support","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413485/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413485/","accessionNumber":"11140875","conferenceDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic filtering based data driven approach for residual life prediction and condition based maintenance decision making support","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"MU3054wangv4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146564S","chronDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5405660","isNumber":"5413335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405660","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5413335","articleId":"5413485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5413508,"authors":[{"name":"Yongsheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yongsheng Zhang","id":"37087187487"},{"name":"Hongkai Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Hongkai Xiong","id":"37087181847"},{"name":"Li Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Li Song","id":"37087183390"},{"name":"Songyu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Songyu Yu","id":"37087190553"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413508","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413508","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resilience","Video coding","Predictive models","Laplace equations","Parameter estimation","Bidirectional control","Statistical distributions","Estimation error","Performance gain","Rate distortion theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image texture","motion estimation","parameter estimation","statistical distributions","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial nonstationary correlation noise modeling","Wyner-Ziv error resilience video coding","parameter estimation","online correlation noise modeling algorithm","bidirectional motion prediction","Laplacian mixture model","statistical distribution","motion vectors estimation error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wyner-Ziv coding","spatial nonstationary","correlation noise modeling"]}],"abstract":"Most of the Wyner-Ziv (WZ) video coding schemes in literature model the correlation noise (CN) between original frame and side information (SI) by a given distribution whose parameters are estimated in an offline process. In this paper, an online CN modeling algorithm is proposed towards a more practical WZ-based error resilient video coding (WZ-ERVC). In ERVC scenario, the side-information is typically generated from the error concealed picture instead of bi-directional motion prediction. The proposed online CN modeling algorithm achieves the so-called classification gain by exploiting the spatially non-stationary characteristics of the motion field and texture. The CN between the source and error concealed SI is modeled by a Laplacian mixture model, where each mixture component represents the statistical distribution of prediction residuals and the mixing coefficients portray the motion vectors estimation error. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains both in rate and distortion versus the conventional Laplacian model.","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413508.pdf","startPage":"2929","endPage":"2932","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial non-stationary correlation noise modeling for Wyner-Ziv error resilience video coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spatial non-stationary correlation noise modeling for Wyner-Ziv error resilience video coding","htmlLink":"/document/5413508/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11150732","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial non-stationary correlation noise modeling for Wyner-Ziv error resilience video coding","confLoc":"Cairo","sourcePdf":"0002929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054833S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5413511,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Chen","affiliation":["INTEL, Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293281700"},{"name":"Kapil Dhingra","affiliation":["Columbia University, USA"],"firstName":"Kapil","lastName":"Dhingra","id":"37397520500"},{"name":"Wen Wu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37406346900"},{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405195400"},{"name":"Rahul Sukthankar","affiliation":["INTEL, Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Sukthankar","id":"37282878500"},{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280192200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413511","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1992},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Videos","Food technology","Face recognition","Image recognition","Testing","Databases","Histograms","Object detection","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","data privacy","image motion analysis","object detection","pattern classification","stereo image processing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pittsburgh fast-food image dataset","visual dataset","motion structure","video privacy-preserving","fast food chains","image capturing","discriminative classifier","object recognition","fast food recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Food image dataset","object recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413511","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413511.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PFID: Pittsburgh fast-food image dataset","abstract":"We introduce the first visual dataset of fast foods with a total of 4,545 still images, 606 stereo pairs, 303 360\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sup>\n videos for structure from motion, and 27 privacy-preserving videos of eating events of volunteers.

First, the projection matrix of the 2D rendered image is estimated; then, using this matrix, a rendered watermark is formed by warping the original watermark pattern. Finally, symmetric phase only matched filtering is used to find the correlation between the rendered image and the rendered watermark.

We exploit the property of dimensionality reduction inherent in compressive sensing/sampling (CS) for image hash design. The gained benefits include (1) the hash size can be kept small and (2) the CS-based hash is computationally secure. We study the use of visual information fidelity (VIF) for hash comparison under Stirmark attacks. We further derive the relationships between the hash of an image and both of its MSE distortion and visual quality measured by VIF, respectively. Hence, based on hash comparisons, both the distortion and visual quality of a query image can be approximately estimated without accessing its original version. We also derive the minimum distortion for manipulating an image to be unauthentic to measure the security of our scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413606","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413606.pdf","startPage":"1285","endPage":"1288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing-based image hashing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413606/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing-based image hashing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150871","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing-based image hashing","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026437S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"17","articleId":"5413606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413608,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Niu","affiliation":["Center of Prognostics and System Health Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Gang Niu","id":"37411533500"},{"name":"Satnam Singh","affiliation":["Diagnosis and Prognosis Group GM India Science Laboratory, GM Global Research and Development, Bangalore, India"],"lastName":"Satnam Singh","id":"38631889100"},{"name":"Steven W.

Visual communications, as well as image and video analysis, benefit in great manner from spatial information such as depth for various applications. Highly accurate visual depth estimation often involves complex optimization algorithms in order to fit proper estimation models to data. From a stereo/multiview matching perspective, local and global algorithms exist. Commonly, the latter are more complex and accurate, as data models are used to take the global structure into account. Belief Propagation has proven to be a good global algorithmic framework for depth estimation. By means of an iterative procedure, it is able to regularize, according to set of local smoothness and geometry constrains, an initial estimation of depth by a local approach such as simple block matching. However, information transfer from iteration to iteration by means of message passing can be excessively demanding in terms of memory bandwidth and usage. In this paper, a new Belief Propagation based algorithm with multiview matching with depth/color segmentation is proposed together with a strategy for message passing compression. Experimental results show the algorithm to be competitive with best performing ones in the state of the art, while reducing by a factor 10 the memory usage, with marginal loss in performance, of a typical Belief Propagation strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413610","startPage":"2353","endPage":"2356","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413610.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth estimation based on multiview matching with depth/color segmentation and memory efficient Belief Propagation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Belief propagation","Iterative algorithms","Message passing","Image segmentation","Visual communication","Image analysis","Information analysis","Data models","Iterative methods","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image matching","image segmentation","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth estimation","multiview matching","memory efficient belief propagation","segmentation","information transfer","message passing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth estimation","Belief Propagation","Multiview-matching","Segmentation","Efficient Message Passing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Depth estimation based on multiview matching with depth/color segmentation and memory efficient Belief Propagation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413610/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150873","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth estimation based on multiview matching with depth/color segmentation and memory efficient Belief Propagation","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0002353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038892S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5413615,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A compact representation of the image is first produced by assembling a feature vector consisting of pseudo-random projections of the decimated image. Then, the quantized projections are encoded to form a hash, which is robustly embedded as a watermark in the image. By recovering the watermark the random projections are obtained, and then used to estimate the distortion of the received image. If tampering is sufficiently sparse or compressible in some basis description, a map of the introduced modification is recovered. The system relies on compressive sensing and distributed source coding principles to reduce the size of the hash of a 1024 \u00d7 1024 image, to about 4,000 bits. With this hash length, tampering sparse up to 20% and with a tampering energy around a PSNR of 15 dB can be successfully localized.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413615","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413615.pdf","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressive-sensing based watermarking scheme for sparse image tampering identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413615/","displayDocTitle":"A compressive-sensing based watermarking scheme for sparse image tampering identification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150932","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413615/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressive-sensing based watermarking scheme for sparse image tampering identification","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072897S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5413642,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengrong Li","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhengrong","lastName":"Li","id":"37404750100"},{"name":"Ross Hayward","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Ross","lastName":"Hayward","id":"37410776200"},{"name":"Jinglan Zhang","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinglan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37337408900"},{"name":"Yuee Liu","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Yuee","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405173200"},{"name":"Rodney Walker","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Rodney","lastName":"Walker","id":"37403805400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413642","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vegetation mapping","Reflectivity","Image reconstruction","Image segmentation","Data mining","Neurons","Space technology","Neural networks","Remote sensing","Electromagnetic wave absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image reconstruction","image segmentation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic tree crown detection","automatic tree crown delineation","spectral feature space","PCNN","pulse coupled neural network","morphological reconstruction","vegetation information extraction","high resolution multispectral aerial images","image segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tree crown delineation","spectral feature","PCNN","morphological reconstruction","image segmentation"]}],"abstract":"The application of object-based approaches to the problem of extracting vegetation information from images requires accurate delineation of individual tree crowns.

First, we propose a multiple partial models method to increase the robustness of button panel detection. Second, we do button recognition by combining structural inference, Hough transform, and multi-symbol recognition techniques.

The assumption states that point-pairs from the high-resolution manifold share the local geometry with the corresponding low-resolution manifold. However, the assumption does not hold always, since the one-to-multiple mapping from LR to HR makes neighbor reconstruction ambiguous and results in blurring and artifacts. To minimize the ambiguous, we utilize Locality Preserving Constraints (LPC) to avoid confusions through emphasizing the consistency of localities on both manifolds explicitly. The LPC are combined with a MAP framework, and realized by building a set of cell-pairs on the coupled manifolds. Finally, we propose an energy minimization algorithm for the MAP with LPC which can reconstruct high quality images compared with previous methods. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413691/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11151054","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413691/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Locality preserving constraints for super-resolution with neighbor embedding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locality preserving constraints for super-resolution with neighbor embedding","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07866S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5413696,"authors":[{"name":"Kwok-Wai Hung","affiliation":["Centre of Signal Processing, Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Kwok-Wai Hung","id":"37411800800"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Centre of Signal Processing, Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wan-Chi","lastName":"Siu","id":"37270783500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413696","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Frequency","Strontium","Signal resolution","Image reconstruction","Image resolution","Image restoration","Computational efficiency","Signal processing algorithms","Recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation model","frequency classification","fast video super-resolution","SAD","SR quality","fusion process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Super-resolution","Dynamic video SR","new motion compensation","fusion"]}],"abstract":"A typical dynamic reconstruction-based super-resolution video involves three independent processes: registration, fusion and restoration. Fast video super-resolution systems apply translational motion compensation model for registration with low computational cost. Traditional motion compensation model assumes that the whole spectrum of pixels is consistent between frames. In reality, the low frequency component of pixels often varies significantly. We propose a translational motion compensation model via frequency classification for video super-resolution systems. A novel idea to implement motion compensation by combining the up-sampled current frame and the high frequency part of the previous frame through the SAD framework is presented. Experimental results show that the new motion compensation model via frequency classification has an advantage of 2 dB gain on average over that of the traditional motion compensation model. The SR quality has 0.25 dB gain on average after the fusion process which is to minimize error by making use of the new motion compensated frame.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New motion compensation model via frequency classification for fast video super-resolution","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413696","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413696.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"New motion compensation model via frequency classification for fast video super-resolution","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413696/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151059","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New motion compensation model via frequency classification for fast video super-resolution","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044514S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5413700,"authors":[{"name":"Lex Schaul","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lex","lastName":"Schaul","id":"37397294800"},{"name":"Cl\u00e9ment Fredembach","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e9ment","lastName":"Fredembach","id":"37271564800"},{"name":"Sabine S\u00fcsstrunk","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"S\u00fcsstrunk","id":"37271567600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413700","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1825},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Light scattering","Rayleigh scattering","Particle scattering","Mie scattering","Layout","Filters","Image fusion","Cameras","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colour photography","image colour analysis","image enhancement","infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color image dehazing","near-infrared","landscape photography","distant objects","image contrast enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Haze","Scattering","Near-infrared","Image fusion","Edge-preserving filters","Multi-resolution"]}],"abstract":"In landscape photography, distant objects often appear blurred with a blue color cast, a degradation caused by atmospheric haze.

Also, an implicit prediction method that can obviate the transmission of side information is proposed. The experimental results show that there are about 0.35\u223c1.0dB gains for the luminance (Y) channel, and 0.5\u223c3.0dB gains for the chrominance (Cb or Cr) channels at the medium to high bit-rates.

We aim at providing an efficient high-quality JPEG color image enhancement algorithm, in terms of color boosting and low computational cost. For that purpose, the high-performance recently proposed iCAM06 model has been adopted, where a wide range of color appearance phenomena are predicted in an efficient manner. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a pseudo-pixel extraction algorithm is applied to the four low-frequency DCT coefficients of each block, resulting in a scaled RGB version of the input image (directly in the DCT domain), where the iCAM06 model is then applied. To cope with the problem of inadequate information of small-sized images, as only 6.25% of the DCT coefficients are used, a 2-fold upsampling is performed at a preprocessing stage. The proposed algorithm outperforms relevant methods, as it is validated by the comparative results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5413744/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141685","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the use of color appearance modeling for efficient compressed-domain image enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of color appearance modeling for efficient compressed-domain image enhancement","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046129S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413760,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Leontaris","affiliation":["Image Technology Research, Dolby Laboratories, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Leontaris","id":"37272645200"},{"name":"Alexis M.

Simulation results indicated that the functional link network showed higher signal to noise ratio in comparison to the pi-sigma neural networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413785/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11227240","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413785/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speech prediction using higher order neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech prediction using higher order neural networks","confLoc":"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569245873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059686S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405659","isNumber":"5413354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405659","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5413354","articleId":"5413785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5413787,"authors":[{"name":"Serkan Kiranyaz","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Serkan","lastName":"Kiranyaz","id":"37397595000"},{"name":"Turker Ince","affiliation":["Izmir University of Economics, Izmir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Turker","lastName":"Ince","id":"37397595100"},{"name":"Moncef Gabbouj","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Moncef","lastName":"Gabbouj","id":"37276556200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5700-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5698-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5699-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5413787","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413787","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is attracting an ever-growing attention and more than ever it has found many application areas for many challenging optimization problems. In this paper, we draw the focus on a major drawback of the PSO algorithm: the poor gbest update. This can be a severe problem, which causes pre-mature convergence to local optima since gbest as the common term in the update equation of all particles, is the primary guide of the swarm. Therefore, we basically seek a solution for the social problem in PSO, i.e. \u00bfWho will guide the guide?\u00bf which resembles the rhetoric question posed by Plato in his famous work on government: \u00bfWho will guard the guards?\u00bf (Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?). Stochastic approximation (SA) is purposefully adapted into two approaches to guide (or drive) the gbest particle (with simultaneous perturbation) towards the right direction with the gradient estimate of the underlying surface (or function) whilst avoiding local traps due to its stochastic nature. We purposefully used simultaneous perturbation SA (SPSA) for its low cost and since SPSA is applied only to the gbest (not the entire swarm), both approaches have thus a negligible overhead cost over the entire PSO process. Yet we have shown over a wide range of non-linear functions that both approaches significantly improve the performance of PSO especially if the parameters of SPSA suits to the problem in hand.","doi":"10.1109/IIT.2009.5413787","startPage":"40","endPage":"44","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405659/5413354/05413787.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIT.2009.5413787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic approximation driven Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic programming","Costs","Rhetoric","Government","Differential equations","Newton method","Power generation economics","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","convergence","particle swarm optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","gbest update","premature convergence","social problem","simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic approximation driven Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413787/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11227288","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic approximation driven Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569245799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076664S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405659","isNumber":"5413354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405659","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5413354","articleId":"5413787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5413825,"authors":[{"name":"Lai-Kuan Wong","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lai-Kuan Wong","id":"37401201200"},{"name":"Kok-Lim Low","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Kok-Lim Low","id":"37267827600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413825","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":800},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Data mining","Image retrieval","Content based retrieval","Image color analysis","Information analysis","Classification algorithms","Thumb","Photography","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saliency-enhanced image aesthetics class prediction","image feature extraction","5-fold cross-validation classification","visual saliency model","discriminative global image features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aesthetics","saliency","classification"]}],"abstract":"We present a saliency-enhanced method for the classification of professional photos and snapshots.

In order to ensure maximum coverage of the observed scene, we have implemented an ad-hoc tool based on the particle swarm optimization. The camera is modeled as a 2D function. A Rayleigh distribution is used to characterize the relevance of the observed object with respect to the distance from the camera and a Gaussian distribution is adopted to model the horizontal field-of-view. Knowing the environment characteristics and the location of obstacles and walls, it is possible to derive a reliable positioning of the sensors. Results are first presented for very simple scenarios; the algorithm is then run to solve the problem in a more realistic environment model.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413833","startPage":"3485","endPage":"3488","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413833.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Camera placement using particle swarm optimization in visual surveillance applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Particle swarm optimization","Video surveillance","Monitoring","Indoor environments","Layout","Gaussian distribution","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Sensor systems","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","particle swarm optimisation","position control","sensor placement","video cameras","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["camera placement","particle swarm optimization","visual surveillance applications","ad-hoc tool","Rayleigh distribution","Gaussian distribution","sensors positioning","camera model","video cameras positioning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video surveillance","camera model","PSO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Camera placement using particle swarm optimization in visual surveillance applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413833/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150624","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Camera placement using particle swarm optimization in visual surveillance applications","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046645S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5413849,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah A.

The results of the comparison indicate that our proposed directional transforms can provide better compression of prediction residuals than the directional transforms proposed for images.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413857","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","startPage":"613","endPage":"616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional wavelet transforms for prediction residuals in video coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Directional wavelet transforms for prediction residuals in video coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413857/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141747","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5413857/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional wavelet transforms for prediction residuals in video coding","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0000613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046888S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5413866,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyan Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoyan Luo","id":"37399489100"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jun Zhang","id":"37293680000"},{"name":"Jingyu Yang","affiliation":["TNList, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jingyu Yang","id":"37406106900"},{"name":"Qionghai Dai","affiliation":["TNList, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qionghai Dai","id":"37273514100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413866","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":706},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Entropy","Performance evaluation","Image sampling","Image coding","Knowledge engineering","Automation","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image fusion","image reconstruction","imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing imaging","image fusion scheme","random projections","multiple input image measurements","entropy metrics","image transformation coefficients","image reconstruction","gradient projection for sparse reconstruction algorithm","block-based CS framework","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image fusion","compressed sensing","entropy"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient image fusion scheme for compressed sensing (CS) imaging, in which fusion is performed on the random projections before reconstruction. Specifically, the measurements of multiple input images are fused into composite measurements via weighted average, in which the weights are calculated based on entropy metrics of the original measurements. Then the fused image with transformation coefficients in a selected basis is reconstructed from the composite measurements by the gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR) algorithm.

For the fixed or portable applications, the channel can be considered as a static. In this paper, we propose to use channel prediction in order to improve the performances of resource allocation algorithms, in term of outage probability and average throughput. Moreover, for a dynamic OFDMA system, when different traffics are offered at each time slot, a good scheduling of the available resources among the users is necessarily. We propose an algorithm of resource allocation based on both the prediction of the channel and the traffic in order to overcome the buffer overflow. For a Constant Bit Rate (CBR), we show that the channel prediction yields a significant average throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive approach for OFDMA resource allocation over fixed wireless channels","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5413884","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5400046/5412201/05413884.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5413884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Predictive approach for OFDMA resource allocation over fixed wireless channels","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413884/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150600","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive approach for OFDMA resource allocation over fixed wireless channels","confLoc":"Medenine, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SC203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068059S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5400046","isNumber":"5412201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5400046","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5412201","articleId":"5413884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5413897,"authors":[{"name":"Jana Zujovic","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jana","lastName":"Zujovic","id":"37397724600"},{"name":"Thrasyvoulos N.

Thus, structural similarity metrics (SSIM) attempt to incorporate \u00bfstructural\u00bf information in image comparisons. The recently proposed structural texture similarity metric (STSIM) relies entirely on local image statistics. We extend this idea further by including a broader set of local image statistics, basing the selection on metric performance as compared to subjective evaluations. We utilize both intra- and inter-subband correlations, and also incorporate information about the color composition of the textures into the similarity metrics.

However, 3D method is currently limited by its registration and computation cost. In this paper, we propose to investigate a solution named asymmetric face recognition scheme, enrolling people in 3D environment but performing identification in 2D. The goal is to limit the use of 3D data to where it really helps to improve recognition performances. In our approach, local binary patterns (LBP) is used as an efficient facial representation for both 2D texture images and 3D range images. A weighted Chi square distance is used as matching score between the 2D LBP facial representations; canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is applied to learn the mapping between LBP-based range face images (3D) and LBP facial texture images (2D). Both matching scores are further fused to obtain the final result. Compared with the traditional 2D/2D algorithms, the proposed asymmetric face recognition scheme achieves better accuracy; while avoiding the high cost of data acquisition and computation in 3D/3D approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413901","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413901.pdf","startPage":"3325","endPage":"3328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric 3D/2D face recognition based on LBP facial representation and canonical correlation analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413901/","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric 3D/2D face recognition based on LBP facial representation and canonical correlation analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141787","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413901/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric 3D/2D face recognition based on LBP facial representation and canonical correlation analysis","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053055S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413903,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Rashidy Kanan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamidreza Rashidy","lastName":"Kanan","id":"37270279200"},{"name":"Yongsheng Gao","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37335964500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413903","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Image recognition","Robustness","Face detection","Testing","Image databases","Partitioning algorithms","Area measurement","Eyes","Geometrical optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image matching","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expression variant face recognition","local statistical approaches","weighted matching method","AWPPZMA","single model databases"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413903","abstract":"Despite remarkable progress on face recognition, little attention has been given to robustly recognize expression variant faces from a single sample image per person.

The proposed weighting method gives more significance to those parts of the face with facial expression variations that change less compared to neutral face image and less significance to those parts that change more. In this contribution, we use the difference between local area in the input face and its corresponding local area in the neutral face image as a measure of observable structure changes.

Simulations using our proposed fitness functions and a fitness function based on inside-outside function show that our fitness function based on the pseudo-Euclidean distance performs better.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413905","startPage":"529","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413905.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms for 3d reconstruction with supershapes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413905/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms for 3d reconstruction with supershapes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413905/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11141791","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms for 3d reconstruction with supershapes","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0000529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087426S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5413918,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Warrell","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Warrell","id":"37397712400"},{"name":"Simon J.D.

The new tracking algorithm, cascade particle filter, is proposed to fill such demands in real environments by constructing the object model while tracking the objects. We have been investigating to implement accurate object recognition on embedded systems in real-time. In order to apply the cascade particle filter to embedded applications such as surveillance, automotives, and robotics, a hardware accelerator is indispensable because of limitations in power consumption.

We compare holistic approaches: Fisherface (FLDA), the null space approach (NLDA) and Eigenfeature Regularization and Extraction (ERE) with feature based approaches: SIFT and PDSIFT. Experiments on the ORL and AR databases show that the performance of PDSIFT is significantly better than the original SIFT approach. Moreover, PDSIFT can achieve comparable performance as the most successful holistic approach ERE and significantly outperforms FLDA and NLDA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition using sift features","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413956","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413956.pdf","startPage":"3313","endPage":"3316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition using sift features","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413956/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150686","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition using sift features","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050172S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5413963,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc-Son Vu","affiliation":["GIPSA Laboratory, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"lastName":"Ngoc-Son Vu","id":"37391309700"},{"name":"Alice Caplier","affiliation":["GIPSA Laboratory, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Caplier","id":"37266382200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413963","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3326},"abstract":"Illumination variations that might occur on face images degrade the performance of face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method of illumination normalization based on retina modeling by combining two adaptive nonlinear functions and a Difference of Gaussians filter. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the Yale B database and the Feret illumination database using two face recognition methods: PCA based and Local Binary Pattern based (LBP). Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves very high recognition rates even for the most challenging illumination conditions. Our algorithm has also a low computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413963.pdf","startPage":"3289","endPage":"3292","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination-robust face recognition using retina modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Retina","Lighting","Photoreceptors","Humans","Gaussian processes","Adaptive filters","Degradation","Image databases","Reflectivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","eye","face recognition","feature extraction","filtering theory","lighting","nonlinear functions","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["retina modeling","illumination normalization","adaptive nonlinear functions","Gaussians filter","Yale B database","Feret illumination database","face recognition","PCA","principal component analysis","local binary pattern","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","illumination invariant","retinal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Illumination-robust face recognition using retina modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413963/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150689","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination-robust face recognition using retina modeling","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110273S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5413975,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Portilla","affiliation":["Imaging and Vision Department, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC), Instituto de \u00f3ptica, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Portilla","id":"37301434300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5413975","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":639},"abstract":"Sparse optimization in overcomplete frames has been widely applied in recent years to ill-conditioned inverse problems. In particular, analysis-based sparse optimization consists of achieving a certain trade-off between fidelity to the observation and sparsity in a given linear representation, typically measured by some \u00bf\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n quasi-norm. Whereas most popular choice for p is 1 (convex optimization case), there is an increasing evidence on both the computational feasibility and higher performance potential of non-convex approaches (0 \u00bf p < 1). The extreme p = 0 case is especial, because analysis coefficients of typical images obtained using typical pyramidal frames are not strictly sparse, but rather compressible. Here we model the analysis coefficients as a strictly sparse vector plus a Gaussian correction term. This statistical formulation allows for an elegant iterated marginal optimization. We also show that it provides state-of-the-art performance, in a least-squares error sense, in standard deconvolution tests.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05413975.pdf","startPage":"3909","endPage":"3912","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5413975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image restoration through l0 analysis-based sparse optimization in tight frames","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Image analysis","Deconvolution","Image coding","Inverse problems","Optical imaging","Optical sensors","Particle measurements","High performance computing","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","image restoration","inverse problems","iterative methods","mean square error methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","L0 analysis-based sparse optimization","tight frames","overcomplete frames","inverse problems","linear representation","convex optimization","Gaussian correction","iterated marginal optimization","least-squares error","deconvolution tests"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image deconvolution","image restoration","optimization","regularization","wavelets","sparsity","tight frames"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5413975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Image restoration through l0 analysis-based sparse optimization in tight frames","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5413975/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141854","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image restoration through l0 analysis-based sparse optimization in tight frames","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056133S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5413975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5413980,"authors":[{"name":"Amol Borkar","affiliation":["Center of Signal and Image Processing (CSIP, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Amol","lastName":"Borkar","id":"37294886200"},{"name":"Monson Hayes","affiliation":["Center of Signal and Image Processing (CSIP, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Monson","lastName":"Hayes","id":"37274863700"},{"name":"Mark T.

The proposed direction calculation method shows very comparable image coding performance to the conventional one, whereas its computational cost is relatively very low.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive directionalwavelet transform using pre-directional filtering","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414014","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414014.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive directionalwavelet transform using pre-directional filtering","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414014/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150745","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive directionalwavelet transform using pre-directional filtering","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0000001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075481S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5414033,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjiang Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjiang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37397293200"},{"name":"Qionghai Dai","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qionghai","lastName":"Dai","id":"37273514100"},{"name":"Xiangyang Ji","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyang","lastName":"Ji","id":"37271425200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414033","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","MIMO","OFDM modulation","Parity check codes","AWGN","Block codes","Error correction codes","Video coding","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","combined source-channel coding","MIMO communication","parity check codes","resource allocation","space-time codes","video coding","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","cooperative video transmission","multiple-input multiple-output architecture","MIMO architecture","MIMO system","joint source-channel coding","low-density parity-check codes","LDPC","diversity-embedded space-time block codes","DE-STBC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative transmission","joint sourcechannel coding","diversity-multiplexing-coding gain tradeoff","scalable video coding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414033","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414033.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint resources allocation for cooperative video transmission","abstract":"This paper proposes a cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture to transmit the video reliably.

Similar to 2D-GARCH model, this new model can capture heavy tailed marginal distribution and the intrascale dependencies of wavelet coefficients. Also, 2D-GARCH-M model introduces additional flexibility in the model formulation in comparison with 2D-GARCH model, which can result in better characterization of SAR images' subbands and improved restoration in noisy environments. Then, we design a Bayesian estimator for estimating the clean image wavelet coefficients. Finally, we compare our proposed method with various speckle suppression methods applied on actual and synthetic SAR images and verify the performance improvement in utilizing the new strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5414050/","accessionNumber":"11150819","displayDocTitle":"A novel wavelet domain statistical approach for denoising SAR images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel wavelet domain statistical approach for denoising SAR images","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003861.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048912S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5414098,"authors":[{"name":"Emad S.

The quadratic component captures the second order nonlinearities in the echo data. Grayscale images from the quadratic component, referred to as quadratic B-mode (QB-mode) images, typically have higher contrast and increased dynamic range than the standard B-mode images (without loss in spatial resolution). An SVD-based algorithm for finding the coefficients of the SoVF based on a linear plus quadratic prediction model of the RF data was developed and validated in a variety of imaging situations, including in vivo. This approach, while successful, may produce images with ripple artifacts due to the truncation of the kernel. Adaptive SoVF implementations based on both LMS and RLS methods have been developed and are shown to produce artifact-free QB-mode images using relatively small kernels, i.e. well suited for real-time implementation. In this paper, we show results of imaging microbubble ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) to demonstrate the increased sensitivity and specificity of QB-mode imaging compared to conventional methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","startPage":"2641","endPage":"2644","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414098.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear post-beamforming filtering of pulse-echo ultrasound for contrast enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5414098/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear post-beamforming filtering of pulse-echo ultrasound for contrast enhancement","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150899","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear post-beamforming filtering of pulse-echo ultrasound for contrast enhancement","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0002641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058554S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5414103,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Montillo","affiliation":["Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA","CIS Department, Rutgers University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Montillo","id":"37395160300"},{"name":"Haibin Ling","affiliation":["Computer and Information Science Department, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Ling","id":"37291439800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414103","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":492},"abstract":"Predicting the age of a person through face image analysis holds the potential to drive an extensive array of real world applications from human computer interaction and security to advertising and multimedia.

We adopt the Gaussian Scale Mixture Fields of Experts (GSM FOE) model and the smoothness constraint as image prior, and use the iterative re-weight least-square (IRLS) algorithm to produce the temporal result. The residual deconvolution suite is used to restore the lost image details. We denoise the result using our std-controlled cross bilateral filter. The experimental results are much better than those of previous approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414143","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414143.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-quality non-blind motion deblurring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-quality non-blind motion deblurring","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414143/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141584","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5414143/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-quality non-blind motion deblurring","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0000153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048983S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5414155,"authors":[{"name":"Suzana Domingues","affiliation":["Laborat\u00f3rio de Projeto de Circuitos Integrados (LPC), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Suzana","lastName":"Domingues","id":"37394664400"},{"name":"Leo H.

For a static version of the above problem, Compressed Sensing (CS) provides a provably exact and computationally efficient solution. But most existing solutions for the actual problem are either offline and non-causal or cannot compute an exact reconstruction (for truly sparse signal sequences), except using as many measurements as those needed for CS. The key idea of our proposed solution (modified-CS) is to design a modification of CS when a part of the support set is known (available from reconstructing the previous image). We demonstrate the exact reconstruction property of modified-CS on full-size image sequences using much fewer measurements than those required for CS. Greatly improved performance over existing work is demonstrated for approximately sparse signals or noisy measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414208.pdf","startPage":"3045","endPage":"3048","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified compressive sensing for real-time dynamic MR imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Noise measurement","Image coding","Wavelet domain","Image sequences","Current measurement","Wavelet transforms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Discrete Fourier transforms","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image sequences","magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","real-time dynamic MR imaging","natural images","linear projection measurement","image sparsity basis","real-time MR image reconstruction","compressed sensing","exact reconstruction","sparse signal sequences","image sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","image sequence reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modified compressive sensing for real-time dynamic MR imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414208/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11150929","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified compressive sensing for real-time dynamic MR imaging","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069212S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5414216,"authors":[{"name":"Kishor Sarawadekar","affiliation":["Department of E & ECE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Kishor","lastName":"Sarawadekar","id":"37395229700"},{"name":"Swapna Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of E & ECE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Swapna","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37276973900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414216","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Block codes","Field programmable gate arrays","Data analysis","Performance analysis","Multiplexing","Encoding","HDTV","Logic design","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","field programmable gate arrays","image coding","multiplexing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient VLSI architecture","bit plane encoder","JPEG 2000","bit plane coder","embedded block coding","optimal truncation","FPGA implementation","context windows","multiplexer based coding style","Xilinx XC2VP30","logic resources","flip-flop slices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["JPEG 2000","EBCOT","Bit Plane Coder"]}],"abstract":"In this paper an optimized architecture of bit plane coder for Embedded Block Coding with Optimal Truncation (EBCOT) algorithm targeting its FPGA implementation is proposed.

First, each watermark bit is spread over N-mutually distinct points of the cover signal and the decision variable at the decoder is formed from the weighted average of N-decision statistics. Attack channel is modeled as Rayleigh distribution followed by AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise). Diversity technique is then applied to form the resultant watermarked image from the weighted average of multiple copies in order to improve detection performance where WSIR (watermark signal to interference ratio) is used as weight factor to achieve low BER (bit error rate). Genetic algorithms (GA) is used to partition embedded bits into multiple groups, namely very strong, strong, weak and very weak based on the normalized magnitudes of their decision variables. Performance of the GA based multiple group combined interference cancellation (MGCIC) for four, three and two groups with conventional interference cancellation (IC) are then reported. A significant improvement in detection performance and capacity is seen with GA based group combined interference cancellation (GCIC) relative to conventional interference cancellation (IC) at the cost of slight increase in computation complexity. Simulation results show that bit error rate (BER) for watermark decoding is reduced as the embedded bits are divided into more number of groups and optimal partitioning of these groups are made through the use of GA.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414262","startPage":"3649","endPage":"3652","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414262.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity assisted GCIC for spread spectrum watermark detection using genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Watermarking","Genetic algorithms","Interference cancellation","Bit error rate","AWGN","Decoding","Detection algorithms","Statistical distributions","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error statistics","genetic algorithms","image coding","interference suppression","Rayleigh channels","spread spectrum communication","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity assisted GCIC","spread spectrum watermark detection","genetic algorithm","group combined interference cancellation","GCIC technique","decision variable","weighted average","N-decision statistics","attack channel","Rayleigh distribution","additive white Gaussian noise","image watermarking","watermark signal to interference ratio","bit error rate","computation complexity","watermark decoding","AWGN channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spread Spectrum watermark","PAD","GA","Payload capacity","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Diversity assisted GCIC for spread spectrum watermark detection using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414262/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151084","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity assisted GCIC for spread spectrum watermark detection using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055444S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5414263,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Here, we propose the use of double embedding in the QIM framework where a single coefficient is modified twice, using two quantizers, to embed two bits. The motivation behind substituting single embedding with double embedding in the QIM framework for a certain steganographic scheme is to increase its hiding rate without significantly increasing the embedding distortion and the stego scheme's detectability against steganalysis. We empirically determine the best way to couple the double embedding framework with a repeat accumulate code based error correction scheme. For moderate noise levels, the use of double embedding is seen to be significantly advantageous over single embedding.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414263","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414263.pdf","startPage":"3653","endPage":"3656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double embedding in the quantization index modulation framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414263/","displayDocTitle":"Double embedding in the quantization index modulation framework","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151085","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414263/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double embedding in the quantization index modulation framework","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048937S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5414286,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Sarkis","affiliation":["Institute of Data Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Sarkis","id":"37295019000"},{"name":"Klaus Diepold","affiliation":["Institute of Data Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Diepold","id":"37295012700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414286","dbTime":"41 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":925},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Image coding","Transform coding","Image reconstruction","Stereo vision","Layout","MPEG 4 Standard","Testing","Computer vision","Video compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","nonlinear systems","variational techniques","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth map compression","compressed sensing","reconstruction scheme","non-linear conjugate gradient minimization scheme","JPEG","JPEG 2000","error rate","compression ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conjugate gradient methods","image coding","image representation","stereo vision"]}],"abstract":"We propose in this paper a new scheme based on compressed sensing to compress a depth map.

Most of these algorithms capture the image of a scene by taking projections of the imaged scene with a large set of different random patterns. Unfortunately, these methods require thousands of serial measurements in order to reconstruct a high quality image, which makes them impractical for most real-world imaging applications. In this work, we explore the idea of performing sparse image capture from a single image taken in one moment of time. Our framework measures a subset of the pixels in the photograph and uses compressed sensing algorithms to reconstruct the entire image from this data. The benefit of our approach is that we can get a high-quality image while reducing the bandwidth of the imaging device because we only read a fraction of the pixels, not the entire array. Our approach can also be used to accurately fill in the missing pixel information for sensor arrays with defective pixels. We demonstrate better reconstructions of test images using our approach than with traditional reconstruction methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414289","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","startPage":"2133","endPage":"2136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel framework for imaging using compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel framework for imaging using compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414289/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151111","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5414289/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel framework for imaging using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0002133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077441S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5414291,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Blackburn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Blackburn","id":"37411239700"},{"name":"Minh N.

Recently proposed directional lifting offers transforms sensitive to edges that are not aligned with the coordinate axes, yet the concatenation of separate 1-D slices implicitly assumes independent directional slices and could create large or isotropic support. True 2-D filters and lifting schemes will avoid both of these problems. By aligning the support of the filters with the expected edge, the filters will create fewer non-zero coefficients. Because these filters correspond to interpolation, the theory of Neville filters can automatically determine the coefficients. For images that consist of two bilinear functions divided by a line, geometric lifting demonstrates a 2-4 times reduction of the number of non-zero coefficients compared with the Daubechies order 2 wavelet. In addition, there is a gain of 2.4 dB in nonlinear approximation.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414291","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","startPage":"3817","endPage":"3820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional geometric lifting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional geometric lifting","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414291/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151112","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5414291/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional geometric lifting","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095552S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5414296,"authors":[{"name":"Erhan Ekmekcioglu","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Erhan","lastName":"Ekmekcioglu","id":"37395317500"},{"name":"Marta Mrak","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Mrak","id":"37268347400"},{"name":"Stewart Worrall","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Stewart","lastName":"Worrall","id":"37285077600"},{"name":"Ahmet Kondoz","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Kondoz","id":"37271690000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414296","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":398},"abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel video object edge adaptive upsampling scheme for application in video-plus-depth and Multi-View plus Depth (MVD) video coding chains with reduced resolution. Proposed scheme is for improving the rate-distortion performance of reduced-resolution depth map coders taking into account the rendering distortion induced in free-viewpoint videos. The inherent loss in fine details due to downsampling, particularly at video object boundaries causes significant visual artefacts in rendered free-viewpoint images. The proposed edge adaptive upsampling filter allows the conservation and better reconstruction of such critical object boundaries. Furthermore, the proposed scheme does not require the edge information to be communicated to the decoder, as the edge information used in the adaptive upsampling is derived from the reconstructed colour video. Test results show that as much as 1.2 dB gain in free-viewpoint video quality can be achieved with the utilization of the proposed method compared to the scheme that uses the linear MPEG re-sampling filter. The proposed approach is suitable for video-plus-depth as well as MVD applications, in which it is critical to satisfy bandwidth constraints while maintaining high free-viewpoint image quality.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Image reconstruction","Video coding","Rate-distortion","Adaptive filters","Decoding","Testing","Gain","Nonlinear

When it comes to image compression applications, it is relevant to estimate the number of bits required to reach a specific image quality. Although several theoretical results regarding the rate-distortion performance of CS have been published recently, there are not many practical image compression results available. The main goal of this paper is to carry out an empirical analysis of the rate-distortion performance of CS in image compression. We analyze issues such as the minimization algorithm used and the transform employed, as well as the trade-off between number of measurements and quantization error. From the experimental results obtained we highlight the potential and limitations of CS when compared to traditional image compression methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414390","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","startPage":"3049","endPage":"3052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the empirical rate-distortion performance of Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the empirical rate-distortion performance of Compressive Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414390/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151163","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5414390/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the empirical rate-distortion performance of Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069522S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5414404,"authors":[{"name":"Nour-Eddine Lasmar","affiliation":["IMS-Groupe Signal-UMR 5218 CNRS, ENSEIRB-Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux 1, France"],"firstName":"Nour-Eddine","lastName":"Lasmar","id":"37398342100"},{"name":"Youssef Stitou","affiliation":["IMS-Groupe Signal-UMR 5218 CNRS, ENSEIRB-Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux 1, France"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Stitou","id":"37398339500"},{"name":"Yannick Berthoumieu","affiliation":["IMS-Groupe Signal-UMR 5218 CNRS, ENSEIRB-Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux 1, France"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Berthoumieu","id":"37331756700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414404","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale skewed heavy tailed model for texture analysis","abstract":"This paper deals with texture analysis based on multiscale stochastic modeling. In contrast to common approaches using symmetric marginal probability density functions of subband coefficients, experimental manipulations show that the symmetric shape assumption is violated for several texture classes.

We present Asymmetric Generalized Gaussian density as a model to represent detail subbands resulting from multiscale decomposition.

Experimental results show that the NS-HDDWT transform yields better enhancement results compared to the undecimated DWT (UDWT) transform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonsubsampled higher-density discrete wavelet transform: Filter design and application in image contrast enhancement","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414406","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414406.pdf","startPage":"3165","endPage":"3168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonsubsampled higher-density discrete wavelet transform: Filter design and application in image contrast enhancement","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414406/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11168457","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonsubsampled higher-density discrete wavelet transform: Filter design and application in image contrast enhancement","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046166S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5414408,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Department Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Stankovi\u0107","id":"37392809100"},{"name":"Lina Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Department Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Stankovi\u0107","id":"37403591400"},{"name":"Samuel Cheng","affiliation":["Department Electrical and computer Engineering, University of Oklahama, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37276497200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414408","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414408","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image sampling","Matching pursuit algorithms","Video compression","Discrete cosine transforms","Iterative algorithms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Layout","Iterative decoding","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","image sampling","iterative methods","magnetic resonance imaging","time-frequency analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive image sampling","side information","Nyquist rate","intraframe correlation","interframe correlation","signal recovery algorithms","discrete cosine transform","iterative algorithm","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","magnetic resonance imaging","MRI","video sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","Image reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sampling is a novel framework that exploits sparsity of a signal in a transform domain to perform sampling below the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we apply compressive sampling to reduce the sampling rate of images/video. The key idea is to exploit the intra- and inter-frame correlation to improve signal recovery algorithms. The image is split into non-overlapping blocks of fixed size, which are independently compressively sampled exploiting sparsity of natural scenes in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain. At the decoder, each block is recovered using useful information extracted from the recovery of a neighboring block. In the case of video, a previous frame is used to help recovery of consecutive frames. The iterative algorithm for signal recovery with side information that extends the standard orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is employed. Simulation results are given for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and video sequences to illustrate advantages of the proposed solution compared to the case when side information is not used.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414408","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414408.pdf","startPage":"3037","endPage":"3040","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive image sampling with side information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Compressive image sampling with side information","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5414408/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151180","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414408/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive image sampling with side information","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0003037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108353S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5414423,"authors":[{"name":"Weisheng Dong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China","Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Weisheng Dong","id":"37087290174"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280177000"},{"name":"Guangming Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Guangming Shi","id":"37087289981"},{"name":"Xiaolin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281235500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414423","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":878},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414423","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Interpolation","Image resolution","Redundancy","Back","Image restoration","Filtering","Filters","Robustness","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image reconstruction","image restoration","interpolation","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive image enlargement","nonlocal iterative back projection algorithm","jaggy artifacts","ringing artifacts","image reconstruction quality","visual perception","image interpolation","image restoration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image interpolation","back-projection","image restoration","non-local method"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel non-local iterative back-projection (NLIBP) algorithm for image enlargement. The iterative back-projection (IBP) technique iteratively reconstructs a high resolution (HR) image from its blurred and downsampled low resolution (LR) counterpart. However, the conventional IBP methods often produce many \u201cjaggy\u201d and \u201cringing\u201d artifacts because the reconstruction errors are back projected into the reconstructed image isotropically and locally. In natural images, usually there exist many non-local redundancies which can be exploited to improve the image reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose to incorporate adaptively the non-local information into the IBP process so that the reconstruction errors can be reduced. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed NLBP can reconstruct faithfully the HR images with sharp edges and texture structures.

For example, the projections based on principal component analysis work better than random projections for some images while the reverse is true for other images. Which feature of images makes such a distinction and what is the optimal set of projections for natural images? In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions with a novel formulation of compressed sensing.

Smoothing is achieved via a Wiener filter incorporated into iterative projected Landweber compressed-sensing recovery, yielding fast reconstruction. The proposed approach yields images with quality that matches or exceeds that produced by a popular, yet computationally expensive, technique which minimizes total variation.

By utilizing a randomly coded non-refractive mask in front of the aperture, incoherent measurements of the light passing through different regions are encoded in the captured images. A novel reconstruction algorithm is proposed to recover the original light field image from these acquisitions. Using the principles of compressive sensing, we demonstrate that light field images with high angular dimension can be captured with only a few acquisitions. Moreover, the proposed design provides images with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and therefore does not suffer from limitations common to existing light-field camera designs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414462","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414462.pdf","startPage":"2337","endPage":"2340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing of light fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414462/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing of light fields","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151234","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414462/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing of light fields","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0002337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056714S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5414472,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey S.

Interpolation techniques using only two neighboring views are generally applied when a virtual view is synthesized. Because the size of an object increases when the virtual camera moves forward, conventional methods have usually addressed this problem by interpolation techniques in order to synthesize a virtual view. However, as it generates a degraded view such as blurred images, we prevent a synthesized view from being blurred by using more images in multiview camera configuration. That is, this problem is solved by applying super-resolution concept which reconstructs a high resolution image from several low resolution images. Data fusion is performed by geometric warping with disparity maps of the multiple images followed by deblurring. Experimental results show that the image quality can further be improved by reducing blurring and halo effects in comparison with the interpolation method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5414509/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11151282","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Virtual view rendering using super-resolution with multiview images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual view rendering using super-resolution with multiview images","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0002345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065403S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5414531,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Bouhlel","affiliation":["National Engineering School of Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Bouhlel","id":"37398155400"},{"name":"Salwa Hajjaji","affiliation":["National Engineering School of Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Salwa","lastName":"Hajjaji","id":"37398154900"},{"name":"Sylvie Sevestre","affiliation":["Laboratoire MAP5, University of Paris Descertes, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Sylvie","lastName":"Sevestre","id":"37398153800"},{"name":"Pascal Laugier","affiliation":["Laboratoire dImagerie Param\u00e9trique, UPMC Paris 6 and CNRS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Laugier","id":"37272202100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414531","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Image texture analysis","Ultrasonic imaging","Malignant tumors","Nakagami distribution","Neoplasms","Pixel","Cancer","Radio frequency","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","image texture","Markov processes","medical image processing","patient treatment","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture analysis","Nakagami-MRF model","ultrasound images","primary choroidal melanomas","backscattered echo","spatial interaction","model parameters","abnormal tissue","Nakagami-MRF parameters","tumor","Markovian model","Nakagami distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Texture Characterization","Nakagami-MRF","Ultrasound Imaging","Choroidal melanoma"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the Nakagami-MRF model is proposed to model the backscattered echo from tissue and at the same time the spatial interaction found in the image.

Such problems appear in many fields including image and signal processing, and have attracted even more interest since the emergence of the compressed sensing (CS) theory. In this paper, we formalize many of these optimization problems within a unified framework of convex optimization theory, and invoke tools from convex analysis and maximal monotone operator splitting. We characterize all these optimization problems, and to solve them, we propose fast iterative convergent algorithms using forward-backward and/or Peaceman/Douglas-Rachford splitting iterations. With non-differentiable sparsity-promoting penalties, the proposed algorithms are essentially based on iterative shrinkage. This makes them very competitive for large-scale problems. We also report some experiments on image reconstruction in CS to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414555.pdf","startPage":"1461","endPage":"1464","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monotone operator splitting for optimization problems in sparse recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Inverse problems","Signal processing algorithms","Dictionaries","Pollution measurement","Signal processing","Large-scale systems","Image processing","Lagrangian functions","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","optimisation","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization problems","sparse recovery","sparse solutions","linear inverse problems","image processing","signal processing","compressed sensing theory","convex optimization theory","convex analysis","maximal monotone operator splitting","iterative convergent algorithms","forward-backward splitting","Peaceman/Douglas-Rachford splitting","non-differentiable sparsity-promoting penalties","iterative shrinkage","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convex analysis","Non-smooth optimization","Monotone operator splitting","Sparse recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Monotone operator splitting for optimization problems in sparse recovery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151329","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monotone operator splitting for optimization problems in sparse recovery","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059434S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5414582,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Jianzhong","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","Center of Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE, University of Maryland, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jianzhong Sun is a Ph.D candidate from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA).

An effective ensemble should consist of a set of learners that are both accurate and diverse. In the training stage, we use the Adaboost.R2 technique to train several weak learners (multi layer perceptron network-MLP) to increase the diversity of the individual models. In the prediction stage, we focus on the design of the fusion of the weak learner ensemble. In contrast with the traditional static weight allocation method based on the overall data set, we propose a dynamic weight allocation method, based on the performance of an individual weak learner on the subset. The idea behind this method was to use a test sample's neighbors to estimate the accuracy and bias of the individual weak learner when the learner is used to make the prediction. An improved hyperrectangle neighborhood defining method is proposed in this paper. Some experiments using MLP neural network as a weak learner on a NASA turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset were carried out. The preliminary empirical comparisons showed higher performance of the novel ensemble learning methodology for the RUL estimation of engineering systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414582/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11140914","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414582/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study of ensemble learning-based fusion prognostics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of ensemble learning-based fusion prognostics","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"MU3020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049269S","chronDate":"12-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5405660","isNumber":"5413335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405660","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5413335","articleId":"5414582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5414611,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Emir Dirik","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Polytechnic Institute of New york University, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmet Emir","lastName":"Dirik","id":"37299605500"},{"name":"Nasir Memon","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, Polytechnic Institute of New york University, USA"],"firstName":"Nasir","lastName":"Memon","id":"37283984000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5654-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5653-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5655-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"5414611","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":985},"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce tamper detection techniques based on artifacts created by color filter array (CFA) processing in most digital cameras.

In registrations, we seek an estimate of the transformation that registers the reference image and test image by optimizing their metric function (similarity measure). To date, local optimization techniques, such as the gradient decent method, are frequently used for medical image registrations. But these methods need good initial values for estimation in order to avoid the local minimum. Recently several global optimization methods such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been proposed for medical image registration. In this paper, we propose a new approach named hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) for 3-D medical image registration, which incorporates two concepts (subpopulation and crossover) of genetic algorithms into the conventional PSO. Experimental results with both mathematic test functions and medical volume data show that the proposed HPSO performs much better results than conventional gradient decent method, GA and PSO.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414613","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403221/5413332/05414613.pdf","startPage":"1753","endPage":"1756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5413332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid particle swarm optimization for 3-D image registration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid particle swarm optimization for 3-D image registration","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414613/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151361","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid particle swarm optimization for 3-D image registration","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"0001753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061461S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403221","isNumber":"5413332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403221","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5413332","articleId":"5414613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5414663,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Geyer","id":"37391100100"},{"name":"Georgios Papafotiou","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, Baden-Dattwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Papafotiou","id":"37282257300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5414663","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":420},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Torque control","Variable speed drives","Pulse width modulation","Switching loss","Pulse width modulation inverters","Medium voltage","Predictive control","Switching converters","Torque converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drives","harmonic distortion","machine control","predictive control","PWM invertors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["five-level inverter","variable speed drive","model predictive direct torque control","computational control method","medium voltage drives","total harmonic distortion","high frequency induction machine","pulse width modulation"]}],"abstract":"Model predictive direct torque control (MPDTC) is a newly developed computational control method for medium-voltage drives, which, based on the principles of model predictive control, reduces the converter's switching losses and improves the torque's total harmonic distortion (THD) with respect to standard direct torque control (DTC), while maintaining DTC's favorable dynamic and robustness properties.

To economize energy and reduce the over voltage, amplitude and rate saturation constraints will be introduced in our control law. The used adaptive fuzzy systems will be adjusted on-line according to some adaptation laws deduced from the stability analysis in the sense of Lyapunov.

In the companion paper (Part I) a new model of peak current control for SEPIC has been introduced. This model takes into account the role played by the coupling capacitor in identifying reliable stability boundary for SEPIC. This is obtained by introducing the difference between input voltage and coupling capacitor voltage in the control law. By making use of the control law model obtained in Part I, this paper presents a method to design an RC damping branch to be put in parallel to the coupling capacitor. Such RC damping branch is selected to guarantee the desired value of the damping factor of dominant complex poles of the closed current loop input-to-coupling capacitor voltage gain. A procedure to identify the optimal values for the damping branch is proposed. A converter has been mounted and its control-to output gain has been measured to verify the correctness of the results. The design approach presented in this paper can be used for all those applications where output inductor required to achieve the same damping factor would be much greater than input inductor, as discusses in companion paper Part I.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Capacitors","Inductors","Voltage","Numerical stability","Capacitance","Ceramics","Filters","Stability analysis","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","damping","DC-DC power convertors","power capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupling capacitive damping","peak-current-controlled SEPIC design","single ended primary inductor converter","current loop stability","RC damping"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5414766","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05414766.pdf","startPage":"1724","endPage":"1729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5414766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEPIC design- part II: Capacitive damping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SEPIC design- part II: Capacitive damping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414766/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414766/","accessionNumber":"11139499","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEPIC design- part II: Capacitive damping","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1724pf020443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04759S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5414766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5414775,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Rohner","affiliation":["Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Rohner","id":"37398145700"},{"name":"Steffen Bernet","affiliation":["Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Bernet","id":"37266741100"},{"name":"Marc Hiller","affiliation":["I DT LD, Siemens AG, Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Hiller","id":"37411897900"},{"name":"Rainer Sommer","affiliation":["I DT LD, Siemens AG, Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Sommer","id":"37298596200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5414775","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1863},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Samarium","Pulse width modulation","Topology","HVDC transmission","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Medium voltage","Virtual colonoscopy","Space vector pulse width modulation","Paper technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel converter","PWM scheme","voltage levels","voltage 6 kV","apparent power 6 MVA"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the principle of operation of the modular multilevel converter (M2C) and presents a new PWM scheme which can be applied for an arbitrary number of voltage levels.

In this paper, the power stage design based on efficiency optimization for forward mode has been proposed to meet specifications of 750 V input, 300 V-600 V/35 kW output and 50 kHz switching frequency. For reverse mode operation, the advanced control strategy with three phase-shift angles has been proposed, since simple phase-shift control cannot reverse power flow. The proposed control strategy is successfully verified by a 15 kW prototype.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Bidirectional control","Resonance","Capacitors","Batteries","DC-DC power converters","Hybrid electric vehicles","Distributed power generation","Energy storage","Fault currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cells (electric)","DC-DC power convertors","phase control","resonant power convertors","switching convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-voltage range bidirectional series resonant converter","clamped capacitor voltage","DC-DC converters","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","PHEV charging stations","distributed renewable power generations","battery energy storage system","high-power efficiency","fault current limiting capability","forward mode operation","reverse mode operation","advanced control strategy","three-phase-shift angles","phase-shift control","power flow","voltage 300 V to 600 V","power 35 kW","frequency 50 kHz","power 15 kW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5414786","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05414786.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5414786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel wide voltage range bi-directional series resonant converter with clamped capacitor voltage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel wide voltage range bi-directional series resonant converter with clamped capacitor voltage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414786/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414786/","accessionNumber":"11139519","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel wide voltage range bi-directional series resonant converter with clamped capacitor voltage","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0082pf016918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046802S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5414786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5414795,"authors":[{"name":"Wilson Cesar Santana","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de g\u00e9nie\u00e9lectrique, Ecole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wilson Cesar","lastName":"Santana","id":"38367598200"},{"name":"Kamal Al-Haddad","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de g\u00e9nie\u00e9lectrique, Ecole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Al-Haddad","id":"37274676300"},{"name":"Luiz Eduardo Borges da Silva","affiliation":["Departamento de Eletr\u00f4nica, Instituto de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Universidade Federal de Itajub\u00e1, Itajuba, Minas Gerais, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luiz Eduardo Borges","lastName":"da Silva","id":"38182371400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5414795","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414795","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","Power system harmonics","Impedance","Power harmonic filters","Voltage","Active filters","Harmonic distortion","Frequency","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic analysis","power apparatus","power filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active resonance dampers","harmonic impedance","distribution feeder","harmonic resistance","ARIMAX","least squares","parameters estimator","installation site voltage","voltage/current sensors","sliding-Goertzel algorithm","adaptive gains","fixed gains","active power filters"]}],"abstract":"This work presents a comparison between two control strategies for Active Resonance Dampers. This kind of equipment must act as a harmonic impedance in order to damp harmonic propagation throughout a distribution feeder. This harmonic resistance must be equal to the characteristic impedance of the distribution feeder in order to achieve optimized compensating currents and avoid over-compensate the feeder (which may amplify distortion on intermediary buses). As the analytical calculation of this impedance is a non-trivial (and maybe, impossible) task, it is proposed an ARIMAX Least-Squares based parameters estimator to determine, on line, the optimal value for the harmonic resistance. The system is modeled in a way that allows the feeder's characteristic impedance to be estimated based only on the installation site voltage (i.e., no voltage/current sensors are required on other parts of the feeder) independently on the number of buses or non-linear loads attached to them. A sliding-Goertzel algorithm is used to extract the harmonic content of the installation site voltage (thus, no PLL or d-q transforms are necessary, making the algorithm suitable for single phase systems). The proposed strategy (estimated impedance) is, then, compared with the traditional one (fixed impedance) through simulations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5414795","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05414795.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"159","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5414795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Resonance Dampers: A comparison between fixed and adaptive gains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Active Resonance Dampers: A comparison between fixed and adaptive gains","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5414795/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11138872","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414795/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Resonance Dampers: A comparison between fixed and adaptive gains","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0154pf006416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060044S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5414795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5414842,"authors":[{"name":"Maher Algreer","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering Merz Court Newcastle upon Tyne England, University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Maher","lastName":"Algreer","id":"37393353200"},{"name":"Matthew Armstrong","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering Merz Court Newcastle upon Tyne England, University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Armstrong","id":"37306600400"},{"name":"Damian Giaouris","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering Merz Court Newcastle upon Tyne England, University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Damian","lastName":"Giaouris","id":"37301128600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5414842","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":548},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation converters","DC-DC power converters","Parameter estimation","Spectral analysis","Frequency response","Control systems","Frequency estimation","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","DC-DC power convertors","fuzzy logic","PWM power convertors","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM converters","dc-dc converters","abrupt load changes","control system design","auto-tuning","adaptive control","power converter design","fuzzy logic","controller design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["system identification","parameter estimation","dc-dc converters"]}],"abstract":"System identification has an important role in control system design, particularly in auto-tuning and adaptive control applications. Recently, it has emerged as a significant research topic in power converter design. For this reason, this paper proposes a new on-line approach to identify the parameters of a dc-dc converter. The proposed method is capable of rapidly detecting and accounting for abrupt load changes during transient periods. In most situations the controller is blind to this change. However, the estimation algorithm is able to update the model parameters before the output reaches the peak overshoot value. As a result, the controller can minimise the effect of any parameter change. The proposed method depends on prediction error variation during a rapid change of load and is designed around a simple fuzzy logic structure. An adaptive forgetting factor is used to optimise the identification process, and this varies very quickly and smoothly with the step load change. Simulation results show that the identification model matches the plant during the transient period. Importantly, the convergence rate and parameters error, the two factors use to validate the algorithm, are very good during system startup and after any abrupt load change.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System identification of PWM dc-dc converters during abrupt load changes","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5414842","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05414842.pdf","startPage":"1788","endPage":"1793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5414842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"System identification of PWM dc-dc converters during abrupt load changes","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414842/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11138918","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System identification of PWM dc-dc converters during abrupt load changes","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1788pf015466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049942S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5414842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5414860,"authors":[{"name":"Iman Sadinezhad","affiliation":["University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Sadinezhad","id":"37393487800"},{"name":"Vassilios G.

The high frequency AC link is achieved by using a reduced switch-count three-phase power electronic transformer (PET). There are two primary windings and one secondary winding in each phase of the PET. The primary windings are coupled in exact phase opposition. A 3 \u00d7 3 matrix converter is used to convert the high frequency secondary voltage to the desired low frequency voltage to be applied at the generator terminals. Two modulation modes as a part of the PWM of the matrix converter are described. In the first mode of operation, the common-mode voltage is eliminated at the generator terminals however, the output voltage transfer ratio of the matrix converter is limited to 0.75. The other modulation mode has higher output voltage transfer ratio equal to 0.866 with finite high-frequency common-mode voltage at the generator terminals. A method for smooth transition between the two modes of operation is described.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5414881","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05414881.pdf","startPage":"4481","endPage":"4486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5414881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel integrated three-phase, switched multi-winding power electronic transformer converter for wind power generation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414881/","displayDocTitle":"A novel integrated three-phase, switched multi-winding power electronic transformer converter for wind power generation system","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414881/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11138955","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel integrated three-phase, switched multi-winding power electronic transformer converter for wind power generation system","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"4481pf026085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059701S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5414881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5414894,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Gabiger","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Gabiger","id":"37393249500"},{"name":"Matthias Kube","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Kube","id":"37393249700"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37266288900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5414894","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":807},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Filters","Image processing","Pipelines","Clocks","Sorting","Kernel","Computer architecture","Technological innovation","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","filtering theory","image processing","image processing equipment","logic design","parallel architectures","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous FPGA design","bilateral filter","image processing","highly parallelized pipeline structure","kernel based processing","pixel clock quadruplication"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a new FPGA design concept of a bilateral filter for image processing is presented. With the aid of this design the bilateral filter can be realized as a highly parallelized pipeline structure with very good utilization of dedicated resources. The innovation of the design concept lies in sorting the input data into groups in a manner that kernel based processing is possible. Another feature of the kernel based design concept is the increase of the clock to the quadruple of the pixel clock in the filter architecture. The sorting of the pixels and the quadruplication of the pixel clock are the key to the synchronous FPGA design using a parallelized pipeline architecture. The synchronicity of the design assures constant output delay which can be computed after the hardware specification is known. For acceleration of the design concept the separability and symmetry of the geometric filter component is utilized, also reducing the complexity of the design. Combined with parallel pipeline design a significant decrease of resource consumption can also be achieved. Thus the presented design can easily be implemented on a common medium sized FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5414894","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05414894.pdf","startPage":"1990","endPage":"1995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5414894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A synchronous FPGA design of a bilateral filter for image processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414894/","displayDocTitle":"A synchronous FPGA design of a bilateral filter for image processing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414894/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A synchronous FPGA design of a bilateral filter for image processing","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1990pf014869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059585S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5414894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5414926,"authors":[{"name":"Josep M.

Due to this property of the transmitted signal, linear power amplifiers (class A, B or AB) are usually used as a solution for the power amplifier stage. These amplifiers have high linearity, but suffer from low efficiency when the transmitted signal has low peak-to-average power ratio. The Kahn envelope elimination and restoration (EER) technique is used to enhance efficiency of RF transmitters, by combining highly efficient, nonlinear RF amplifier (class D or E) with a highly efficient envelope amplifier in order to obtain linear and highly efficient RF amplifier. This paper compares two solutions for the envelope amplifier based on a combination of multilevel converter and linear regulator. The solutions are compared regarding their efficiency, size and weight. Both solutions can reproduce any signal with maximal spectral component of 1 MHz and give instantaneous maximal power of 50 W. The efficiency measurements show that when the signals with low average value are transmitted, the implemented prototypes have up to 19% higher efficiency than linear regulator that is used as a conventional solution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency amplifiers","Transmitters","Power amplifiers","Regulators","Phase modulation","High power amplifiers","Linearity","Peak to average power ratio","Signal restoration","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convertors","power amplifiers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel architectures","envelope amplifier","modern transmitters","envelope modulation","phase modulation","transmitted signal","linear power amplifiers","power amplifier stage","peak-to-average power ratio","Kahn envelope elimination and restoration technique","RF transmitters","nonlinear RF amplifier","multilevel converter","linear regulator","spectral component","frequency 1 MHz","power 50 W"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5414936","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05414936.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5414936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of two multilevel architectures for envelope amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of two multilevel architectures for envelope amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414936/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414936/","accessionNumber":"11139043","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of two multilevel architectures for envelope amplifier","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0283pf012718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055497S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5414936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5414939,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For the discussed DC-DC converter, a galvanic isolation (isolation voltages of up to 35 kV) is required. This electrical isolation is achieved with a coreless transformer in order to obtain a cost-effective solution. Furthermore, the DC-DC converter contains a full-bridge converter being operated with low switching losses, a resonant compensation network to achieve a high overall efficiency and an output side rectifier. In this paper, the design of the coreless transformer, the appropriate compensation networks and the power electronics are discussed in detail. Moreover, measurement results obtained from a 100 W prototype, operated at a switching frequency of 410 kHz, are presented. With the proposed setup, a high overall efficiency of up to 80% and a transformer breakdown voltage of 55 kVrms is achieved. Thus, the proposed converter concept represents a very competitive solution with respect to the typically employed DC-DC converters with dry-type cast coil transformers.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5414939","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05414939.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5414939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contactless energy transmission for an isolated 100W gate driver supply of a medium voltage converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5414939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5414939/","displayDocTitle":"Contactless energy transmission for an isolated 100W gate driver supply of a medium voltage converter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139046","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5414939/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contactless energy transmission for an isolated 100W gate driver supply of a medium voltage converter","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0302pf016284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081514S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5414939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5414970,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The performance of the whole system will be affected by the suitability of the implemented harmonic identification method. In this work, the equivalences and advantages of the discrete cosine transform with respect to other Fourier based algorithms are demonstrated. It is proved in this paper that both the transient length and the phase error in presence of grid frequency deviations are halved in comparison to DFT. Therefore, it is convenient to provide a frequency adaptation feature to the discrete cosine transform. In this work it is proposed to adjust the window width to the grid fundamental frequency, and to enhance the frequency resolution by means of dithering.

The inverter is based in a full-bridge converter where a few diodes and one inductor have been added to enable single stage operation. The new topology provides an additional buck-boost converter function at the bridge level in order to extract the maximum power from photovoltaic (PV) panel. Non linear control is used to regulate the sinusoidal current injected in the grid and the PV voltage, so that maximum power point tracker, MPPT, is obtained. The new MPPT algorithm uses one cycle sampling technique to obtain the average value of the voltage and current in the panel with a small time delay. This technique eliminates errors introduced in the MPPT calculation, due to the switching ripple. The proposed algorithm also allows the operation of the control circuit at a lower frequency than the high switching frequency of the bridge converter transistors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Sampling methods","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Bridge circuits","Diodes","Inductors","Topology","Voltage control","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","maximum power point trackers","nonlinear control systems","photovoltaic power systems","power generation control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single stage inverter","PV applications","one cycle sampling technique","MPPT algorithm","maximum efficient photovoltaic grid connection","full-bridge converter","buck-boost converter","photovoltaic panel","nonlinear control","maximum power point tracker","bridge converter transistors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415029","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415029.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single stage inverter for PV applications with One Cycle Sampling technique in the MPPT algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single stage inverter for PV applications with One Cycle Sampling technique in the MPPT algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415029/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415029/","accessionNumber":"11139135","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single stage inverter for PV applications with One Cycle Sampling technique in the MPPT algorithm","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0842pf008443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055827S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5415040,"authors":[{"name":"Romeu Hausmann","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Blumenau, Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Romeu","lastName":"Hausmann","id":"37408080200"},{"name":"Rodrigo da Silva","affiliation":["Power Electronics Institute INEP, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"da Silva","id":"37398428000"},{"name":"Ivo Barbi","affiliation":["Power Electronics Institute INEP, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ivo","lastName":"Barbi","id":"37274409800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5415040","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"abstract":"A new NPC three-phase inverter with three-phase coupled inductor is presented in this paper.

One way to introduce modularity to integrated designs is to utilize intelligent power electronics building blocks as a base for power electronics systems. The main reason for moving toward a building-block-based design is that the traditional centralized control structure does not provide much flexibility and reusability. A building-block-based design needs a distributed control scheme that sets new challenges to system design. Distributed control of building blocks requires a deterministic, real-time communication scheme and accurate synchronization. The synchronization becomes an issue especially with ring-based control topologies. In this paper, a flexible time-stamping-based synchronization scheme for a cascaded ring communication topology is proposed. Further, a communication scheme suitable for building-block-based designs is presented. The achieved synchronization accuracy is analyzed in relation to a parallel connection of power semiconductors.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415042","startPage":"925","endPage":"930","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415042.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-stamping-based synchronization of power electronics building block systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Time-stamping-based synchronization of power electronics building block systems","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415042/","accessionNumber":"11139148","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415042/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-stamping-based synchronization of power electronics building block systems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0925pf012696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045395S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5415054,"authors":[{"name":"Cs.

That is done by means of a multi-objective optimization approach called Strength Pareto algorithm, which is based on Pareto Optimality concept used in Game theory literature. In the first scenario, start up regime of the converted is optimized. Settling time and overshoot are taken as two objective functions while the PID controller's gains (Kp, Ki, and Kd) are design variables. The program generates a set of optimal gains called Pareto Set corresponding to a Pareto Front, which is a set of optimal results for the objective functions. One can easily pick out any of the results based on its features and its own engineering view. Then maximum and minimum bands of the hard limiter in the loop are considered as additional variables which significantly improve the response. In another design, besides the large signal start up behavior, dynamic response of the converter is also optimized. Finally besides, optimal start up, a new objective function is defined ensuring switching stability and chaos rejection, a concept is of quite importance. Extensive simulation and some experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed design methodology to achieve a wide set of desired technical goals.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415056","startPage":"3315","endPage":"3322","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415056.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaos rejection and optimal dynamic response for boost converter using SPEA multi-objective optimization approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415056/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Chaos rejection and optimal dynamic response for boost converter using SPEA multi-objective optimization approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415056/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11139161","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaos rejection and optimal dynamic response for boost converter using SPEA multi-objective optimization approach","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3315pf023779.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073905S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5415065,"authors":[{"name":"Tadahiro Oyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadahiro","lastName":"Oyama","id":"37410023800"},{"name":"Yasue Mitsukura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture\uc2a0and\uc2a0Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasue","lastName":"Mitsukura","id":"37274166700"},{"name":"Stephen Githinji Karungaru","affiliation":["Institute of Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Stephen Githinji","lastName":"Karungaru","id":"37274047200"},{"name":"Satoru Tsuge","affiliation":["Institute of Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoru","lastName":"Tsuge","id":"37286039600"},{"name":"Minoru Fukumi","affiliation":["Institute of Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Fukumi","id":"37274047400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5415065","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wrist","Electromyography","Signal processing","Neural networks","Arm","Linear discriminant analysis","Electrodes","Optical fiber devices","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical electrodes","electromyography","feature extraction","medical signal processing","motion measurement","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal identification","EMG","neural network","electromyogram","electrode","wrist","statistical method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415065","abstract":"Recently, researches of artificial arms and pointing devices using electromyogram (EMG) have been actively done.

Due to clean and efficient power generation, the hydrogen fed fuel cell vehicle (FCVs) has received considerable attention. However, major obstacles such as cost of the hydrogen infrastructure, driving range, and cost of the fuel cell greatly influence FCV development. At the same time, proper utilization of grid power, along with a modified electrical system infrastructure, would encourage automakers to envisage plug-in versions of fuel cell vehicles. This paper presents the optimal powertrain component sizing of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric (FC-PHEV) vehicle, comprised of a fuel cell with electrolyser, Ni-MH battery as secondary energy storage, and a propulsion motor. Such a PHEV architecture provides an additional degree of freedom, as the grid power can be used to recharge batteries, or for the electrolysis of water, to generate hydrogen and oxygen, which increases the driving range of vehicle as well as the overall powertrain efficiency. Hence, the overall performance and efficiency are much superior when compared to ordinary PHEV or FC-HEV powertrains. This paper uses a small vehicle power train for modelling and simulation purposes. Optimal sizing of the power train components using multi-objective genetic algorithm will be presented. Moreover, overall vehicle performance and fuel economy for different driving loads will also be analysed. Finally, an overall cost analysis will also be presented.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415111","startPage":"3741","endPage":"3746","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415111.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal powertrain component sizing of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicle using multi-objective genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415111/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal powertrain component sizing of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicle using multi-objective genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415111/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11139211","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal powertrain component sizing of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicle using multi-objective genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3741pf025976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101527S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5415122,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Wrzecionko","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Wrzecionko","id":"37393747500"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Biela","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Biela","id":"37283640800"},{"name":"Johann W.

Hence, a lot of research on package configurations for power semiconductor operation above 175?C is currently carried out, especially within the automotive industry due to the possible high ambient temperatures occurring in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). This paper shows, that a higher junction temperature though does not necessarily guarantee a higher utilization of the SiC chips with respect to the current that the device can conduct without overheating. The reason is, that for most power devices the power losses start to increase very rapidly at high junction temperatures while the power that can be dissipated always increases linearly with the junction temperature. The junction temperature, where the device current starts to decrease at, is derived for different SiC chips using measured onstate conduction and switching losses in this paper. This paper furthermore analyzes in detail, how the junction temperature on the one hand is influenced by boundary conditions and on the other hand influences itself the core parameters of a converter such as efficiency, the required chip area (i. e. cost) as well as the volumetric power density and thus forms an additional degree of freedom in the design of a power electronic converter. While calculating the optimum junction temperature and analyzing its impact on the system performance, it is demonstrated, how these results can help to find the best suited power semiconductor device for the particular application. The performance of the calculations is shown on a design applied to a drive inverter for hybrid electric vehicles with normally-off SiC JFETs. Operated close to the optimum junction temperature of the SiC JFETs, it reaches a power density of 51 kW/l for the power modules and the air-cooling system, which is shown to be doubled by increasing chip size and using an advanced power semiconductor package with a lower thermal resistance from junction to ambient than the for this case assumed 1 K/W.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415122.pdf","endPage":"3841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SiC power semiconductors in HEVs: Influence of junction temperature on power density, chip utilization and efficiency","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415122","startPage":"3834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"SiC power semiconductors in HEVs: Influence of junction temperature on power density, chip utilization and efficiency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415122/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11139222","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5415122/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SiC power semiconductors in HEVs: Influence of junction temperature on power density, chip utilization and efficiency","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3834pf025925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054438S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5415123,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In addition, the optimization includes an algorithm to determine the chip size required for the semiconductor devices under consideration of the thermal characteristics and efficiency requirements.

The converter provides a constant current waveform to the load parting from a DC bus voltage. The converter, operating with a peak current control, keeps the current through the LEDs constant independently of the bus voltage. This is carried out internally by self-adjusting the switching frequency of the converter. Thus, the requirements of the capacitance of the bus capacitor are greatly diminished, allowing the avoidance of electrolytic technology. Also, low frequency PWM dimming can be carried out easily.

It aims energy savings, high luminous efficiency and high useful life with the replacement of incandescent or compact fluorescent lamps by LEDs without any change in the electrical system installation. In order to supply the LEDs by mains with a constant current, the Buck converter has been used because it provides an output voltage lower than the input one. The circuit has been designed to supply 36 to 52 high-brightness LEDs connected in series, resulting in a converter output voltage between 90 V and 187 V. The load can also be composed of power LEDs. The main disadvantage of series connection is that the damage of one LED can results in an open-circuit, disconnecting the entire group. The proposed idea to solve this problem is the introduction of Diacs connected in parallel with groups of LEDs. So, if one LED burns, the Diac in parallel with this group keeps the current path, guaranteeing the operation of the others groups. To verify the proposed idea, prototypes of the lamp have been implemented and tested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5415169/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139265","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design procedure for a compact lamp using high-intensity LEDs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design procedure for a compact lamp using high-intensity LEDs","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3506pf025909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058042S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5415171,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The proposal aims energy saving, high luminous efficacy and high useful life when replacing traditional emergency lighting systems, using fluorescent lamps by LEDs. The use of E-27 socket (the same used in traditional incandescent lamps), provides the advantage of easy installation, with the simple replacement of the lamp without any change in the electrical installation. To supply the LEDs by mains and by battery a Buck and a Boost converter were employed. The converters work without electrolytic capacitors which has advantages such as reducing of size and cost of the circuit and increasing the driver's useful life. The battery can be composed of three rechargeable Ni-MH batteries (1.2 V) or a Li-Ion battery (3.6 V). The design complies with the Brazilian standard and international standard for emergency lighting systems. The complete circuit was implemented and the experimental results show a satisfactory behavior of the lamp.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415171","startPage":"3494","endPage":"3499","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415171.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact emergency lamp using power LEDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Compact emergency lamp using power LEDs","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415171/","accessionNumber":"11139267","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415171/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact emergency lamp using power LEDs","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3494pf025879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049459S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5415189,"authors":[{"name":"Alexis Marcano-Cede\u00f1o","affiliation":["Group of Automation in Signals and Communications,UPM, Technical University Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Marcano-Cede\u00f1o","id":"38272441400"},{"name":"J.

During training phase, the AMP training algorithm gives more relevance to the less frequent patterns and subtracts relevance to the frequent ones, achieving a much more efficient training, while at least maintaining the MLP's performance. AMP is specially recommended when few patterns are available to train the network. In this paper, we implement an Artificial Metaplasticity MLP (AMMLP) in order to classify defects in wood images. The defects are three different types of knots found in wood surfaces. Classification is based on the features obtained from Gabor filters. Experimental results show that AMMLPs reach better accuracy than the classical BP algorithm as well as with recently proposed algorithms applied on the same database.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415189","startPage":"3422","endPage":"3427","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415189.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wood defects classification using Artificial Metaplasticity neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Gabor filters","Feature extraction","Aerospace industry","Backpropagation algorithms","Frequency","Band pass filters","Spatial databases","Communication industry","Manufacturing industries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gabor filters","image classification","information theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","wood"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wood defects classification","artificial metaplasticity neural network","neural network training algorithm","biological metaplasticity property","neurons","Shannon information theory","MLP","wood images","Gabor filters","multilayer perceptron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wood defects classification using Artificial Metaplasticity neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415189/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139284","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wood defects classification using Artificial Metaplasticity neural network","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3422pf025755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058104S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5415200,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In addition, genetic algorithms, one of powerful intelligent search techniques, was employed in order to optimize a set of parameters required by the developed extended Luenberger speed observer.

for phase and symmetrical components estimation in power systems","abstract":"An original three-phase neural approach for phase and symmetrical components estimation is proposed in this paper. This neural structure can be used for power quality control, in an active power filtering scheme for example. The approach is composed of a neural symmetrical voltage components extraction and a neural phase detection technique. These functional tasks are decomposed and approximated by the learning of Adaline neural networks. The whole neural architecture is implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP) and is applied to a three-phase power system. The presented analysis substantiates the immunity of the proposed approach under distorted utility conditions. Experimental results, under various utility conditions, demonstrate its phase tracking and voltage components extraction abilities. Its performance and robustness are also compared to a conventional phase-lock loop (PLL) on a three-phase power supply with varying parameters and distorted by harmonics and random noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415210/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11139321","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415210/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for phase and symmetrical components estimation in power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for phase and symmetrical components estimation in power systems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3252pf025011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074792S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5415211,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Pigazo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computers, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Pigazo","id":"37266997500"},{"name":"V\u00edctor M.

The FBD method considers the averaged load conductance in order to obtain an accurate reference signal for compensation purposes, as a drawback, a whole period at the fundamental grid frequency is required in the most general case for evaluation of the averaged load conductance.

This concept is called more electric aircraft (MEA), which involves the introduction of the electromechanical actuators (EMAs) and the electro-hydraulics actuators (EHAs) for the actuation of the flight surfaces of wide-body aircraft, moving from the \u00bffly-by wire\u00bf to the \u00bfpower-by wire\u00bf concept. The resulting step change in aircraft electrical loading will have far reaching implications for the electrical generation system. Considerable effort is being directed towards realizing the so-called more electric engine (MEE), which foresee an integration of the electrical generator directly inside the main gas turbine engine. Also the entire electrical distribution system is subject to radical revisiting, with a trend which is leaving the constant frequency AC energy distribution in favor of variable frequency or DC solutions. Hence, it is evident the MEA trend increments the technical challenges and research topics for the electrical engineering in the aeronautic applications. The aim of the paper is the presentation, from the electrical engineering point of view, of some of the most challenging application of electric machines and drives in the incoming new aircraft generation. There are too many on board electric components and systems to be analyzed: the authors centre the attention on the most safety critical drives: flight surface actuators, fuel pumps and generators.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415238","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415238.pdf","startPage":"2587","endPage":"2594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The safety critical electric machines and drives in the more electric aircraft: A survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The safety critical electric machines and drives in the more electric aircraft: A survey","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415238/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11139347","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415238/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The safety critical electric machines and drives in the more electric aircraft: A survey","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2587pf027502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099336S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5415261,"authors":[{"name":"M.

They aim at decreasing the time to detect all the tags in range (identification delay). In FSA, the maximum identification rate (average number of tags identified per slot) is achieved when the number of contending tags matches the cycle length (number of slots in a frame). Therefore, the reader should ideally know the actual number of competing tags. However, in RFID scenarios this figure varies randomly, and the reader has to guess the number of contenders somehow.

cascaded H-bridge multilevel converters for grid connection of photovoltaic systems is analyzed. The use of the multilevel converter introduces a series of advantages: improved power quality (lower current ripple), smaller filters, reduced switching frequency, no need of boost dc-dc stage and possible elimination of step-up transformer, all of which have a positive impact on the system efficiency. However it requires a more sophisticated control method specially due to dc-link voltage drifts produced by circulating power in the converter. The proposed control method is based on traditional voltage oriented control with a cascaded dc-link voltage control and grid current control loop. Two extra stages are added to this traditional control scheme, one to introduce maximum power point tracking for each module or string, and another to control the dc-link voltages drift due to circulating power in the converter. The latter is performed by the addition of a simple feedforward control strategy directly in the modulation stage. The proposed control method is modular and easy to adapt for any number of converters in series. Simulation results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5415332/","accessionNumber":"11139566","displayDocTitle":"Control of a cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter for grid connection of photovoltaic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of a cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter for grid connection of photovoltaic systems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3976pf027456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068508S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5415342,"authors":[{"name":"Masakuni Oshiro","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masakuni","lastName":"Oshiro","id":"37411764700"},{"name":"Toshihiro Nishimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37287475800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5415342","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Kernel","Speckle","Ultrasonic imaging","Image edge detection","PSNR","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Lesions","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","fuzzy neural nets","medical image processing","speckle","tumours","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image quality improvement","fuzzy neural network","Epanechnikov kernel","ultrasound imaging","speckle noise","MultiLayer BackPropagation Neural Networks","lesion boundaries","autoedge detection","Detail Variance","Background Variance","breast tumor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415342","abstract":"Ultrasound (US) imaging is considered as one of the most advanced diagnostic tools in medical use. However, a drawback of the medical US imaging is its poor quality of the image, which is affected by speckle noise. In this paper, a Multi-Layer Back-Propagation Neural Networks (MLBPNNs) with the Epanechnikov fuzzy function is proposed to reduce the speckle, and while at the same time, enhance the lesion boundaries of the US image. The main goal of the proposed method is to improve the quality of US image so as to improve the quality of the humans interpretation and the computer systems auto-edge detection. In order to automatically detect the lesion boundary by a computer system, an edge enhancement is required. Evaluating the simulation results by Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE), Detail Variance (DV), and Background Variance (BV), the proposed method demonstrates an increased performance of reducing the speckle and enhancing the edge. The proposed method has higher PSNR than conventional methods and can remove the speckle sufficiently, so that tumor boundaries of real US breast tumor image could be preserved and detected.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415342","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415342.pdf","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2135","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"US image improvement using fuzzy Neural Network with Epanechnikov kernel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"US image improvement using fuzzy Neural Network with Epanechnikov kernel","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11139575","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5415342/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"US image improvement using fuzzy Neural Network with Epanechnikov kernel","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2130pf011487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057489S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5415371,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuyoshi Mutoh","affiliation":["Tokyo Metropolitan University, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuyoshi","lastName":"Mutoh","id":"37270731700"},{"name":"Satoru Manaka","affiliation":["Tokyo Metropolitan University, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoru","lastName":"Manaka","id":"37394308500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5415371","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Friction","Road vehicles","Vehicle driving","Wheels","Propulsion","Torque control","Control systems","Acceleration","Prototypes","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","electric propulsion","electric vehicles","road safety","road vehicles","torque","wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle","driving performance","low friction coefficient roads","front-and-rear-wheel-independent-drive","FRID EV","propulsion systems","driving torques","braking torques","road surface conditions"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on a front-and-rear-wheel-independent-drive-type-electric vehicle (FRID EV) which is being developed as the next generation EV with ideal characteristics of driving performance.

The FRID EV has the function for performing efficient acceleration and deceleration on all roads by suitably distributing the driving or braking torques to the front and rear wheels according to the road surface conditions. The function enables safe running on slippery roads, i. e., low \u00bf-roads like frozen roads, by simultaneously controlling slip ratios of the front and rear wheels in consideration of load movement.

Phase shedding is an established technique to improve the efficiency of multi-phase converters at light load, by changing the active number of phases depending on the load current level. In order to minimize the output voltage deviation due to phase shedding and the transient time required to recover the nominal operating conditions, a minimum time algorithm is investigated. The proposed technique is insensitive to the power stage parameters, as its operation relies only on the steady-state duty-cycle and the number of phases to be turned-on or turned-off. The minimum response time is achieved through a feedforward action undertaken as soon as the phase shedding command is received. The proposed approach is validated through experimental tests on a synchronous buck converter prototype.

Finally, the digital circuit is implemented in the FPGA, and the simulations are experimentally verified.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415392","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415392.pdf","startPage":"2913","endPage":"2918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of a digital controller for a dc-dc converter using floating point arithmetic","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11138967","htmlLink":"/document/5415392/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of a digital controller for a dc-dc converter using floating point arithmetic","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2913pf022268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095334S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5415402,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, when the controller parameters or its structure have to be adapted to internal and external varying conditions, e.g., when a self-optimizing control system is pursued, a static implementation might not lead to the best utilization of reconfigurable resources. This contribution outlines the implementation of a self-optimizing system composed of several possible hardware and software realizations of controllers for a permanent magnet servo motor. How well a specific controller realization is suited to the current situation is evaluated based on control quality and realization effort (i.e., CPU time, reconfigurable area). A System-on-Chip architecture is presented, which enables an on-line exchange of FPGA- and CPU-based realizations of controllers to optimize resource utilization and control quality. It is shown that by using dynamic hardware reconfiguration, such self-optimizing controller can be implemented based on FPGA technology. Furthermore, the design-flow including self-developed tools is outlined. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme works satisfactory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5415402/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11138976","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based realization of self-optimizing drive-controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based realization of self-optimizing drive-controllers","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2848pf027847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08932S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5415403,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Kaminski","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Machines, Drives and Measurements, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Kaminski","id":"38270962600"},{"name":"Teresa Orlowska-Kowalska","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Machines, Drives and Measurements, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Orlowska-Kowalska","id":"38276030200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5415403","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415403","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Shafts","Digital signal processing","System testing","Couplings","Mechanical variables control","State feedback","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drives","field programmable gate arrays","machine control","matrix algebra","neurocontrollers","parameter estimation","power engineering computing","signal reconstruction","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural speed estimator","elastic coupling","neural network based estimator","load machine","two-mass drive system","reconfigurable field-programmable gate array","parallel signal processing","NI CompactRIO controller","input vector preprocessing","FPGA matrix","signal reconstruction","electrical drive system","parameters identification"]}],"abstract":"In this paper implementation of neural network based estimator of the load machine speed for two-mass drive system on a reconfigurable field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is presented.

The main part of research is concentrated on implementation of neural networks estimators with required internal structure in FPGA matrices.

Majority of the said controllers are designed to work with brushless dc motors. However, many existing two-axis and three-axis gimbaled systems work with conventional analog PID controllers, brushed dc motors and synchros as position sensors. Whenever there is a need for a replacement of the electronics of similar systems, the analog electronics is replaced by digital equivalent. The choice of using off-the-shelf solutions is rather limited because of the prime mover and the output sensing devices. Design and implementation of a case-specific processor based solution is often the only cost-effective option. The present work proposes the step-by-step procedure for the fast prototyping of a digital PID controller for brushed dc motors on an FPGA-based Soft-Core Microcontroller. The input section consists of an analog signal conditioner for scaling the reference input and the sensed feedback signal, a serial analog-to-digital converter (SADC) and a programmable gain amplifier (PGA). The output stage consists of an H-bridge power amplifier for driving the armature circuit of the dc servo motor (DCSM). The platform used is a Spartan 3E FPGA (x3s500E) with an embedded 8-bit PicoBlaze microcontroller. Though a single-axis implementation is documented, it can easily be extended for two-axis and three-axis systems using multiple soft-core processors embedded on the same FPGA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415406.pdf","startPage":"2825","endPage":"2830","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast prototyping of a digital PID controller on a FPGA based soft-core microcontroller for precision control of a brushed DC servo motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Three-term control","Digital control","Field programmable gate arrays","Microcontrollers","Servomechanisms","DC motors","Micromotors","Servomotors","Brushless DC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","analogue-digital conversion","brushless DC motors","field programmable gate arrays","microcontrollers","motion control","power amplifiers","servomotors","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast prototyping","digital PID controller","soft-core microcontroller","precision control","brushed DC servo motor","digital proportional integral derivative controllers","digital motion control","brushless dc motors","gimbaled systems","synchros","position sensors","case-specific processor","cost-effective option","feedback signal","serial analog-to-digital converter","programmable gain amplifier","H-bridge power amplifier","armature circuit","dc servo motor","Spartan 3E FPGA","x3s500E","PicoBlaze microcontroller","multiple soft-core processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast prototyping of a digital PID controller on a FPGA based soft-core microcontroller for precision control of a brushed DC servo motor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415406/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11138980","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast prototyping of a digital PID controller on a FPGA based soft-core microcontroller for precision control of a brushed DC servo motor","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2825pf010006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049333S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5415408,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Mart\u00edn","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Alcala, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Mart\u00edn","id":"37403801100"},{"name":"Emilio Bueno","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Alcala, Spain"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Bueno","id":"37270955400"},{"name":"Francisco J.

This is especially true in systems where the used sampling period is greater than the computation time delay.

A systematic way of converting a Simulink specification into VHDL code is described which mainly involves customized fixed-point hardware definition, Data Flow Graph (DFG) extraction, Algorithm State Machine with Data path (ASMD) representation and VHDL specification of the system, inter alia.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A methodology for optimizing the FPGA implementation of industrial control systems","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2009.5415408","startPage":"2811","endPage":"2816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2009.5415408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5414636","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405664/5414636/05415408.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A methodology for optimizing the FPGA implementation of industrial control systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415408/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11138982","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A methodology for optimizing the FPGA implementation of industrial control systems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2811pf025429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052133S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405664","isNumber":"5414636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405664","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5414636","articleId":"5415408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5415429,"authors":[{"name":"Ab\u00edlio Azenha","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porta, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ab\u00edlio","lastName":"Azenha","id":"37351825000"},{"name":"Adriano Carvalho","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porta, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Adriano","lastName":"Carvalho","id":"37284756000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4648-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4649-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4650-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"5415429","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Radio frequency","Artificial neural networks","RF signals","Equations","Wireless application protocol","Vehicles","Automatic control","Communication system control","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic guided vehicles","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","protocols","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network approach","AGV localization","trilateration","radio frequency localization","automated guided vehicles","wireless protocols","received signal strength indication","ANN learning","quasi-structured environments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415429","abstract":"This paper describes radio frequency (RF) localization for indoors quasi-structured environments using an artificial neural network (ANN) approach.

One of the imaging systems will require a 11.75 T magnet with a 900 mm warm bore. Regarding the large aperture and field strength, this magnet is a real challenge when compared to the largest MRI systems ever built, it is being developed within an ambitious R&D program, Iseult, focused on high field MRI. The conservative MRI magnet design principles are not readily applicable, other concepts taken from high energy physics or fusion experiments, namely the Tore Supra tokamak magnet system, will be used. The coil will thus be made of a niobium-titanium conductor cooled by a He II bath at 1.8 K, permanently connected to a cryoplant. Due to the high level of stored energy, about 340 MJ, and a relatively high nominal current, about 1500 A, the magnet will be operated in a non-persistent mode with a conveniently stabilized power supply. In order to take advantage of superfluid helium properties and regarding the high electromagnetic stresses on the conductors, the winding will be made of wetted double pancakes meeting the Stekly criterion for cryostability. The magnet will be actively shielded to fulfill the specifications regarding the stray field. In order to develop the magnet design on an experimental basis, an ambitious R&D program has been set-up based on magnet prototypes, high field test facility (Seht) and stability experiments.

The existence of the hysteresis friction nonlinearity from pivot bearing, which is represented as the LuGre hysteresis friction model here, increases the position error signal of read-write head and deteriorates the performance of HDD servo systems. To compensate for the effect of the hysteresis friction nonlinearity, NN is adopted to approximate its unknown bounding function. With the proposed control, all the closed-loop signals are ensured to be bounded while the tracking error converges into a neighborhood of zero. Comprehensive comparisons between the conventional proportional-integral-derivative control (without friction compensator) and the proposed adaptive NN control (with friction compensator) are provided in experiment results. It is shown that the proposed control can mitigate the effect of the hysteresis friction nonlinearity and improve the track seeking performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2010.2041233","startPage":"351","endPage":"358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5715605/05415528.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2010.2041233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Control of Hard Disk Drives With Hysteresis Friction Nonlinearity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Hard disks","Hysteresis","Friction","Pi control","Servosystems","Servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","disc drives","friction","hard discs","magnetic bearings","magnetic hysteresis","neurocontrollers","servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural network control","hard disk drive","hysteresis friction nonlinearity","friction compensator","servo control","pivot bearing","LuGre hysteresis friction model","read-write head","HDD servo system","closed-loop signal","adaptive NN control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","hard disk drive (HDD)","hysteresis friction compensation","neural networks (NNs)","pivot nonlinearity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Control of Hard Disk Drives With Hysteresis Friction Nonlinearity","volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5415528/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11832640","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Control of Hard Disk Drives With Hysteresis Friction Nonlinearity","sourcePdf":"tcst-sge-2041233-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062837S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5715605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5715605","articleId":"5415528","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5415534,"authors":[{"name":"Daizhan Cheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Sciences, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5592241/5415534/5415534-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daizhan Cheng (F'06) received the Ph.D. degree from Washington University, St. Louis, MO, in 1985.","He is currently a Professor with Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing.

To overcome this, we first obtain crude ML frequency-offset estimators using single-time-slot samples from the received time-domain OFDM block. These crude frequency estimators are shown to have unique closed-form solutions. We then optimally combine these crude frequency estimators in the linear-minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) sense for a more accurate solution. Finally, by alternatively updating the LMMSE frequency estimator and the ML channel estimator through adaptive iterations, we successfully avoid the use of a multidimensional log-likelihood function, hence obviating the complex task of global solution search and, meanwhile, achieve good estimation performance. Our estimators have mean square errors (MSEs) tightly close to Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) with a wide tracking range.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2042738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05415535.pdf","startPage":"2093","endPage":"2097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2042738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Adaptive Iteration Algorithm for Frequency Tracking and Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415535/","displayDocTitle":"Effective Adaptive Iteration Algorithm for Frequency Tracking and Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","volume":"59","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285981","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415535/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Adaptive Iteration Algorithm for Frequency Tracking and Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2042738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051879S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5415535","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5415537,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Salem","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5484898/5415537/5415537-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Salem (S\u201906) received the B.Sc. degree in communications and electronics and the M.Sc. degree from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2000 and 2006, respectively.

Advanced and intelligent radio resource management (RRM) schemes are known to be crucial toward harnessing these opportunities in future OFDMA-based relay-enhanced cellular networks. However, it is not very clear how to address the new RRM challenges (such as enabling distributed algorithms, intra-cell/inter-cell routing, intense and dynamic co-channel interference (CCI), and feedback overhead) in such complex environments comprising a plethora of relay stations (RSs) of different functionalities and characteristics. Employment of conventional RRM schemes in such networks will highly be inefficient if not infeasible. The next-generation networks are required to meet the expectations of all wireless users, irrespective of their locations. High-data-rate connectivity, mobility, and reliability, among other features, are examples of these expectations. Therefore, fairness is a critical performance aspect that has to be taken into account in the design of prospective RRM schemes. This paper reviews some of the prominent challenges involved in migrating from the conventional cellular architecture to the relay-based type and discusses how intelligent RRM schemes can exploit the opportunities in relay-enhanced OFDMA-based cellular networks. We identify the role of multiantenna systems and explore the current approaches in literature to extend the conventional schedulers to next-generation relay networks. This paper also highlights the fairness aspect in such networks in the light of the recent literature, provides some example fairness metrics, and compares the performances of some representative algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunities and Challenges in OFDMA-Based Cellular Relay Networks: A Radio Resource Management Perspective","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2042736","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5484898/05415537.pdf","startPage":"2496","endPage":"2510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2042736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415537","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415537/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2010","displayDocTitle":"Opportunities and Challenges in OFDMA-Based Cellular Relay Networks: A Radio Resource Management Perspective","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5415537/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"Jun 2010","accessionNumber":"11392325","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunities and Challenges in OFDMA-Based Cellular Relay Networks: A Radio Resource Management Perspective","sourcePdf":"tvt-adinoyi-2042736.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14422S","chronDate":"Jun  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5484898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5484898","articleId":"5415537","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5415539,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoting Wang","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5592241/5415539/5415539-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoting Wang received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Wuhan University, Hubei, China, in 2005 and a Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., in 2006, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.","His research interests include the theory of quantum control and its applications in quantum information science."]},"firstName":"Xiaoting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407483400"},{"name":"Sophie G.

A control design based on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance as a Lyapunov function is considered. The control dynamics is redefined on an extended space where the LaSalle invariance principle can be correctly applied even for non-stationary target states. LaSalle's invariance principle is used to derive a general characterization of the invariant set, which is shown to always contain the critical points of the Lyapunov function. Critical point analysis of the latter is used to show that, for generic states, it is a Morse function with n! isolated critical points, including one global minimum, one global maximum and n!-2 saddles. It is also shown, however, that the actual dynamics of the system is not a gradient flow, and therefore a full eigenvalue analysis of the linearized dynamics about the critical points of the dynamical system is necessary to ascertain stability of the critical points. This analysis shows that a generic target state is locally asymptotically stable if the linearized system is controllable and the invariant set is regular, and in fact convergence to the target state (trajectory) in this case is almost global in that the stable manifolds of all other critical points form a subset of measure zero of the state space. On the other hand, if either of these sufficient conditions is not satisfied, the target state ceases to be asymptotically stable, a center manifold emerges around the target state, and the control design ceases to be effective.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lyapunov method","Trajectory","Control design","Target tracking","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Stability analysis","Control systems","Convergence","State-space methods","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","control system analysis","convergence","critical points","discrete time systems","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","invariance","linearisation techniques","Lyapunov methods","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov method","quantum states control","trajectory tracking","Hilbert-Schmidt distance","LaSalle invariance principle","non-stationary target states","critical point analysis","generic states","Morse function","eigenvalue analysis","state space","linearized dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eigenvalue analysis","LaSalle invariance principle","quantum systems","trajectory tracking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2043292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5592241/05415539.pdf","startPage":"2259","endPage":"2270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5592241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2043292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Lyapunov Method for Control of Quantum States","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Lyapunov Method for Control of Quantum States","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415539/","volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415539/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11559930","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Lyapunov Method for Control of Quantum States","sourcePdf":"tac-schirmer-2043292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106664S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5592241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5592241","articleId":"5415539","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":5415540,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis K.

With the introduction of robots in everyday life, especially in providing services to people with special needs (i.e., elderly, people with impairments, or people with disabilities), there is a strong necessity for simple and natural control interfaces. In this paper, electromyographic (EMG) signals from muscles of the human upper limb are used as the control interface between the user and a robot arm. EMG signals are recorded using surface EMG electrodes placed on the user's skin, making the user's upper limb free of bulky interface sensors or machinery usually found in conventional human-controlled systems. The proposed interface allows the user to control in real time an anthropomorphic robot arm in 3-D space, using upper limb motion estimates based only on EMG recordings. Moreover, the proposed interface is robust to EMG changes with respect to time, mainly caused by muscle fatigue or adjustments of contraction level. The efficiency of the method is assessed through real-time experiments, including random arm motions in the 3-D space with variable hand speed profiles.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2010.2040832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2010.2040832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5475408/05415540.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EMG-Based Robot Control Scheme Robust to Time-Varying EMG Signal Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"An EMG-Based Robot Control Scheme Robust to Time-Varying EMG Signal Features","volume":"14","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11328271","pubMedId":"20172839","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415540/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EMG-Based Robot Control Scheme Robust to Time-Varying EMG Signal Features","sourcePdf":"titb-artemiadis-2040832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080405S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5475408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"5475408","articleId":"5415540","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5415542,"authors":[{"name":"Cheolhwan Oh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Utah Valley State University, Orem, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5441221/5415542/5415542-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheolhwan Oh (S'97\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1989, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2005.","From 2006 to 2008, he was a Researcher at the Bindley Bioscience Center, Purdue University.

For example, to well characterize a natural scene image, it is essential to find a set of visual features to represent its color, texture, and shape information and encode each feature into a vector. Therefore, we have a set of vectors in different spaces to represent the image. Conventional spectral-embedding algorithms cannot deal with such datum directly, so we have to concatenate these vectors together as a new vector. This concatenation is not physically meaningful because each feature has a specific statistical property. Therefore, we develop a new spectral-embedding algorithm, namely, multiview spectral embedding (MSE), which can encode different features in different ways, to achieve a physically meaningful embedding. In particular, MSE finds a low-dimensional embedding wherein the distribution of each view is sufficiently smooth, and MSE explores the complementary property of different views. Because there is no closed-form solution for MSE, we derive an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm to obtain the low-dimensional embedding. Empirical evaluations based on the applications of image retrieval, video annotation, and document clustering demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2039566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2039566","startPage":"1438","endPage":"1446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5593944/05415552.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5593944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiview Spectral Embedding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiview Spectral Embedding","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11641537","pubMedId":"20172832","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5415552/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiview Spectral Embedding","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-xia-2039566-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094091S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5593944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"301","xplore-issue":"5593944","articleId":"5415552","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5415562,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed classification model is formed according to the current neuroscience trends, since it adopts the independency of two emotional dimensions, namely arousal and valence, as dictated by the bidirectional emotion theory, whereas it is gender-specific. A two-step classification procedure is proposed for the discrimination of emotional states between EEG signals evoked by pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, which also vary in their arousal/intensity levels. The first classification level involves the arousal discrimination. The valence discrimination is then performed. The Mahalanobis (MD) distance-based classifier and support vector machines (SVMs) were used for the discrimination of emotions. The achieved overall classification rates were 79.5% and 81.3% for the MD and SVM, respectively, significantly higher than in previous studies. The robust classification of objective emotional measures is the first step toward numerous applications within the sphere of human-computer interaction.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2010.2041553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5475408/05415563.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2010.2041553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Emotion Aware Computing: An Integrated Approach Using Multichannel Neurophysiological Recordings and Affective Visual Stimuli","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Toward Emotion Aware Computing: An Integrated Approach Using Multichannel Neurophysiological Recordings and Affective Visual Stimuli","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415563/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11328272","pubMedId":"20172835","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415563/","volume":"14","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Emotion Aware Computing: An Integrated Approach Using Multichannel Neurophysiological Recordings and Affective Visual Stimuli","sourcePdf":"titb-bamidis-2041553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18519S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5475408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5475408","articleId":"5415563","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5415565,"authors":[{"name":"Sudharman K.

In this paper, we formalize this concept by developing a general game-theoretic framework for the DSL and by carefully identifying requirements for the coexistence of primary and secondary systems via spectrum leasing. In contrast to hierarchical spectrum access, spectrum owners in proposed DSL networks, which are denoted as primary users, dynamically adjust the amount of secondary interference that they are willing to tolerate in response to the demand from secondary transmitters. The secondary transmitters, in turn, opportunistically attempt to achieve maximum possible throughput, or another suitably defined reward, while not violating the interference limit that is set by the primary users. The new game-theoretic model, however, allows the secondary users to encourage the spectrum owners to push the interference cap upward based on demand. We have proposed a general structure for the utility functions of primary users and secondary users that allows the primary users to control the price and the demand for spectrum access based on their required quality of service (QoS). We establish that, with these utility functions, the DSL game has a unique Nash equilibrium to which the best response adaptation finally converges. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed coexistence and best response adaptations can be achieved with no significant interaction between the two systems. In fact, it is shown that the only requirement is that the primary system periodically broadcasts two parameter values. We use several examples to illustrate the system behavior at the equilibrium and use the performance at the equilibrium to identify suitable system design parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415565/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2010","publicationDate":"Jun 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415565/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11392320","volume":"59","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Leasing: A New Paradigm for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Leasing: A New Paradigm for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-jayaweera-2042741.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057414S","chronDate":"Jun  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5484898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5484898","articleId":"5415565","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5415566,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia","School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5484898/5415566/5415566-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nan Yang (S\u201909) received the B.S. degree in electronics in 2005 from China Agricultural University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2007 from the Beijing Institute of Technology, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","From 2008 to 2010, he was a visiting Ph.D. student with the School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

A thorough and exact analysis is conducted to analyze the outage probability of MRNs under dissimilar Nakagami-m fading conditions. More specifically, we derive new closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the probability density function (pdf) of the highest end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) associated with the strongest destination with the single user and Rayleigh fading as special cases. In particular, we provide new results for channel-state information (CSI)-based-gain relaying and fixed-gain relaying. We then demonstrate that the achievable diversity order is equal to either the first-hop fading parameter or the product of the second-hop fading parameter and the number of destinations. Furthermore, we derive compact closed-form expressions for the moments of the highest end-to-end SNR, from which other moment-based measures such as the average SNR and the amount of fading are deduced. Our results highlight the performance improvements offered by opportunistic scheduling and reveal the impact of the relay location with unbalanced hops on the overall performance. Various numerical examples illustrate the proposed analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability of Multiuser Relay Networks in Nakagami-- Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2042828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5484898/05415566.pdf","startPage":"2120","endPage":"2132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2042828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415566/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2010","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability of Multiuser Relay Networks in Nakagami-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5415566/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"Jun 2010","accessionNumber":"11392330","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability of Multiuser Relay Networks in Nakagami-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-elkashlan-2042828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114673S","chronDate":"Jun  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5484898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5484898","articleId":"5415566","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5415567,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Galindo-Serrano","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5415567/5415567-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ana Galindo-Serrano received the telecommunication and electronic engineering degree from Instituto Superior Polit\u00e9cnico Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverria, La Habana, Cuba, in 2007.

In particular, we consider a secondary CR system based on the IEEE 802.22 standard for wireless regional area networks (WRANs), and we model it as a multiagent system where the multiple agents are the different secondary base stations in charge of controlling the secondary cells. We propose a form of real-time multiagent reinforcement learning, which is known as decentralized Q-learning, to manage the aggregated interference generated by multiple WRAN systems. We consider both situations of complete and partial information about the environment. By directly interacting with the surrounding environment in a distributed fashion, the multiagent system is able to learn, in the first case, an efficient policy to solve the problem and, in the second case, a reasonably good suboptimal policy. Computational and memory requirement considerations are also presented, discussing two different options for uploading and processing the learning information. Simulation results, which are presented for both the upstream and downstream cases, reveal that the proposed approach is able to fulfill the primary-user interference constraints, without introducing signaling overhead in the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415567/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","volume":"59","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11286001","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5415567/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Q-Learning for Aggregated Interference Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Q-Learning for Aggregated Interference Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-galindoserrano-2043124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06982S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5415567","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5415569,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Zher Poh","affiliation":["Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5475408/5415569/5415569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming-Zher Poh (S'09) received the B.Sc.

Consequently, considerable work is currently underway to identify new microbes based on genetic characterizations, and one limitation is that the majority of sequencing schemes will miss rare populations of microbes as large numbers are pooled for analysis. One approach to overcome this obstacle is to presort the microbes from a heterogeneous field sample based on size, as many microbes live in small clusters, and then analyze the various strains using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in situ</i>\n hybridization. In this paper, a multilayered microfluidic device has been developed for the size-based separation of heterogeneous microbial samples as a first step toward this goal. This device is fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane and soft lithographic techniques. The device includes three successive constrictions with reducing heights and was employed to successfully separate a heterogeneous population of microparticles and field samples obtained from Lake Michigan. The device was found to trap the microparticles and environmental samples with efficiency between 89% and 98% when the particles were larger than the constrictions and 97% for the unknown environmental sample.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Size-Based Separation of Microparticles in a Multilayered Microfluidic Device","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2040459","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5441232/05415574.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2040459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Size-Based Separation of Microparticles in a Multilayered Microfluidic Device","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5415574/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208129","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Size-Based Separation of Microparticles in a Multilayered Microfluidic Device","sourcePdf":"jmems-eddington-2040459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078922S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5441232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5441232","articleId":"5415574","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5415581,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Herzel","affiliation":["IHP GmBH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5545511/5415581/5415581-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frank Herzel was born in G\u00fcstrow, Germany, in 1963.

One of the major challenges in such research is extracting an informative subset of features that can best discriminate between the different forearm movements. In this paper, a new dimensionality reduction method, referred to as orthogonal fuzzy neighborhood discriminant analysis (OFNDA), is proposed as a response to such a challenge. Unlike existing attempts in fuzzy linear discriminant analysis, the objective of the proposed OFNDA is to minimize the distance between samples that belong to the same class and maximize the distance between the centers of different classes, while taking into account the contribution of the samples to the different classes. The proposed OFNDA is validated on EMG datasets collected from seven subjects performing a range of 5 to 10 classes of forearm movements. Practical results indicate the significance of OFNDA in comparison to many other feature projection methods (including locality preserving and uncorrelated variants of discriminant analysis) with accuracies ranging from 97.66% to 87.84% for 5 to 10 classes of movements, respectively, using only two EMG electrodes.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2039480","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5464455/05415600.pdf","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1419","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2039480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Fuzzy Neighborhood Discriminant Analysis for Multifunction Myoelectric Hand Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Fuzzy Neighborhood Discriminant Analysis for Multifunction Myoelectric Hand Control","volume":"57","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11340761","pubMedId":"20172801","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5415600/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Fuzzy Neighborhood Discriminant Analysis for Multifunction Myoelectric Hand Control","sourcePdf":"tbme-khushaba-2039480-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090918S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5464455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5464455","articleId":"5415600","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5415601,"authors":[{"name":"Rajet Krishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA","Center of Excellence in Wireless Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5508692/5415601/5415601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajet Krishnan (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the University of Kerala, India, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Kansas State University, Manhattan, in 2009.","He is currently a Research Engineer at the Center of Excellence in Wireless Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India where he is currently engaged in research on investigating interference management techniques in 4G (LTE-A and 802.16 m) wireless systems.

In this paper, we propose an automated, two-stage PPG data processing method to minimize the effects of motion artifacts. The technique is based on our prior work related to motion artifact detection (stage 1) [R. Krishnan, B. Natarajan, and S. Warren, ``Analysis and detection of motion artifacts in photoplethysmographic data using higher order statistics,'' in \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Acoust., Speech, Signal Process. (ICASSP 2008)</i>\n, Las Vegas, Nevada, Apr. 2008, pp. 613-616] and motion artifact reduction (stage 2) [R. Krishnan, B. Natarajan, and S. Warren, ``Motion artifact reduction in photoplethysmography using magnitude-based frequency domain independent component analysis,'' in \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Proc. 17th Int. Conf. Comput. Commun. Network</i>\n, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Aug. 2008, pp. 1-5]. Regarding stage 1, we present novel and consistent techniques to detect the presence of motion artifact in PPGs given higher order statistical information present in the data. We analyze these data in the time and frequency domains (FDs) and identify metrics to distinguish between clean and motion-corrupted data. A Neyman-Pearson detection rule is formulated for each of the metrics. Furthermore, by treating each of the metrics as observations from independent sensors, we employ hard fusion and soft fusion techniques presented in [Z. Chair and P. Varshney, ``Optimal data fusion in multiple sensor detection systems,'' \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">IEEE Trans. Aerosp. Electron. Syst., AES</i>\n, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 98-101, Jan. 1986] and [C. C. Lee and J. J. Chao, ``Optimum local decision space partitioning for distributed detection,'' \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">IEEE Trans. Aerosp. Electron. Syst., AES</i>\n, vol. 25, no. 7, pp. 536-544, Jul. 1989], respectively, in order to fuse individual decisions into a global system decision. For stage two, we propose a motion artifact reduction method that is effective even in the presence of severe subject movement. The approach involves an enhanced preprocessing unit consisting of a motion detection unit (MDU, developed in this paper), period estimation unit, and Fourier series reconstruction unit. The MDU identifies clean data frames versus those corrupted with motion artifacts. The period estimation unit determines the fundamental frequency of a corrupt frame. The Fourier series reconstruction unit reconstructs the final preprocessed signal by utilizing the spectrum variability of the pulse waveform. Preprocessed data are then fed to a magnitude-based FD independent component analysis unit. This helps reduce motion artifacts present at the frequencies of the reconstruction components. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the overall motion artifact reduction method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Approach for Detection and Reduction of Motion Artifacts in Photoplethysmographic Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2039568","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5508692/05415601.pdf","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2039568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508692","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415601/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Approach for Detection and Reduction of Motion Artifacts in Photoplethysmographic Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5415601/","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11510508","pubMedId":"20172800","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Approach for Detection and Reduction of Motion Artifacts in Photoplethysmographic Data","sourcePdf":"tbme-krishnan-2039568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112477S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5508692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5508692","articleId":"5415601","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5415604,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Hong Guan","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5545511/5415604/5415604-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi-Hong Guan graduated in mathematics from the Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China, in 1979, and received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 1994.","From 1994 to 1996, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communications, the South China University of Technology.

Due to the lack of sensors that can be worn comfortably during normal daily activity and over extensive periods of time, research in this area is limited to laboratory settings or artificial clinical environments. We developed a novel, unobtrusive, nonstigmatizing, wrist-worn integrated sensor, and present, for the very first time, a demonstration of long-term, continuous assessment of EDA outside of a laboratory setting. We evaluated the performance of our device against a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved system for the measurement of EDA during physical, cognitive, as well as emotional stressors at both palmar and distal forearm sites, and found high correlations across all the tests. We also evaluated the choice of electrode material by comparing conductive fabric with Ag/AgCl electrodes and discuss the limitations found. An important result presented in this paper is evidence that the distal forearm is a viable alternative to the traditional palmar sites for EDA measurements. Our device offers the unprecedented ability to perform comfortable, long-term, and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in situ</i>\n assessment of EDA.

The modeled soils are characterized by surface roughness, correlation length, bulk moisture content, vertical moisture gradient, and small air-filled-void content. Simulation results include both backscatter and interferometric phase, and we are particularly interested in assessing the potential of the latter as a proxy for soil moisture. We find that differences in homogeneous bulk moisture result in only small phase differences (< 5?). In contrast, combinations of vertical moisture gradients and small air-filled voids, which may typically exist in more realistic soils, can produce phase changes > 30? for HH and > 50? for VV when the soil moisture is varied from 3% to 30% in the uppermost 2 cm of the soil. Phase changes of this magnitude are easily detectable by spaceborne InSAR techniques. While a strong phase response to a change in mean bulk moisture is common to vertical moisture gradient and small air-filled-void cases, their corresponding backscatter responses are very different. A vertical moisture gradient makes the backscatter response dramatically flatter compared with the case of uniform moisture; in contrast, the introduction of air-filled voids barely alters the backscatter. Thus, it may be possible to infer near-surface soil-structure parameters such as vertical gradients or fractions of voids and inhomogeneities from combined SAR phase and backscatter data. Future SAR sensors could be optimized for this purpose. Prior theoretical work based on the assumption of vertically uniform soil-moisture distributions may need to be adjusted, and the lack of a theory that accommodates more complex soil structures may explain why backscatter inversions have yet to result in a viable operational system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote

The main difficulty that the proposed method circumvents is the presence of fractional derivatives in the time-domain representation of the polarization relation. The latter is approximated by a set of auxiliary differential equations using Pad approximants, where each approximant corresponds to a single relaxation time of the Cole-Cole model. The auxiliary differential equations are discretized by means of central differences and are further employed within a conventional FDTD scheme. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulating the propagation of a wideband Gaussian pulse that excites a one-dimensional Cole-Cole medium with two relaxation times.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","volume":"9","accessionNumber":"11156343","publicationDate":"2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415637/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Modeling of Wave Propagation in Cole-Cole Media With Multiple Relaxation Times","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Modeling of Wave Propagation in Cole-Cole Media With Multiple Relaxation Times","sourcePdf":"lawp-irekanos-2043410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03066S","chronDate":"2010","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5423326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5423326","articleId":"5415637","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5415642,"authors":[{"name":"Tariq Al-Khasib","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5484898/5415642/5415642-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tariq Al-Khasib (S'99) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan, in 2001 and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2004.

In addition, DiffSIC is able to achieve the optimal SIC detection order that results in the best overall system performance. To develop DiffSIC, we introduce analytical methods toward finding instantaneous symbol error rates (SERs) for zero-forcing SIC (ZF-SIC) and minimum mean square error SIC (MMSE-SIC) detectors. Furthermore, we devise two procedures to reduce the computational complexity associated with the computation of SER and the enumeration of detection orders. We present a number of numerical results that clearly demonstrate the ability of DiffSIC to accomplish service differentiation and overall performance improvement in

Internet traffic among residential and business customers are driving the migration of today's end user's network access from cable to optical fiber and superbroadband wireless systems The integration of optical and wireless systems operating at much higher carrier frequencies in the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) range is considered to be one of the most promising solutions for increasing the existing capacity and mobility, as well as decreasing the costs in next-generation optical access networks. In this paper, several key enabling technologies for very high throughput wireless-over-fiber networks are reviewed, including photonic mm-wave generation based on external modulation or nonlinear effects, spectrum-efficient multicarrier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing and single-carrier multilevel signal modulation. We also demonstrated some applications in wireless-over-fiber trials using these enabling techniques. The results show that the integrated systems are practical solutions to offer very high throughput wireless to end users in optically enabled wireless access networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5524641/05415646.pdf","startPage":"2376","endPage":"2397","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2041748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2041748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Effective Optical Millimeter Technologies and Field Demonstrations for Very High Throughput Wireless-Over-Fiber Access Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical modulation","Integrated optics","Optical fiber networks","Nonlinear optics","OFDM modulation","IP networks","Telecommunication traffic","Optical fiber cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","millimetre waves","optical fibre subscriber loops","radio access networks","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-effective optical millimeter technology","very high throughput wireless-over-fiber access systems","Internet traffic","end user network access","superbroadband wireless systems","millimeter wave range","next-generation optical access networks","very high throughput wireless-over-fiber networks","photonic mm-wave generation","nonlinear effects","external modulation","spectrum-efficient multicarrier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","single-carrier multilevel signal modulation","wireless access networks","optical fiber cable"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["External modulation","field trial","millimeter-wave (mm-wave)","multilevel modulation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","radio over fiber (ROF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Effective Optical Millimeter Technologies and Field Demonstrations for Very High Throughput Wireless-Over-Fiber Access Systems","volume":"28","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/5415646/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11465569","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Effective Optical Millimeter Technologies and Field Demonstrations for Very High Throughput Wireless-Over-Fiber Access Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-yu-2041748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.247568S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5524641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5524641","articleId":"5415646","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5415658,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Y.

The ability to automatically detect and quantify extent of LI on histopathology imagery could potentially result in the development of an image based prognostic tool for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2+) BC patients. Lymphocyte segmentation in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained BC histopathology images is complicated by the similarity in appearance between lymphocyte nuclei and other structures (e.g., cancer nuclei) in the image. Additional challenges include biological variability, histological artifacts, and high prevalence of overlapping objects. Although active contours are widely employed in image segmentation, they are limited in their ability to segment overlapping objects and are sensitive to initialization. In this paper, we present a new segmentation scheme, expectation-maximization (EM) driven geodesic active contour with overlap resolution (EMaGACOR), which we apply to automatically detecting and segmenting lymphocytes on HER2+ BC histopathology images. EMaGACOR utilizes the expectation-maximization algorithm for automatically initializing a geodesic active contour (GAC) and includes a novel scheme based on heuristic splitting of contours via identification of high concavity points for resolving overlapping structures. EMaGACOR was evaluated on a total of 100 HER2+ breast biopsy histology images and was found to have a detection sensitivity of over 86% and a positive predictive value of over 64%. By comparison, the EMaGAC model (without overlap resolution) and GAC model yielded corresponding detection sensitivities of 42% and 19%, respectively. Furthermore, EMaGACOR was able to correctly resolve over 90% of overlaps between intersecting lymphocytes. Hausdorff distance (HD) and mean absolute distance (MAD) for EMaGACOR were found to be 2.1 and 0.9 pixels, respectively, and significantly better compared to the corresponding performance of the EMaGAC and GAC models. EMaGACOR is an efficient, robust, reproducible, and accurate segmentation technique that could potentially be applied to other biomedical image analysis problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expectation\u2013Maximization-Driven Geodesic Active Contour With Overlap Resolution (EMaGACOR): Application to Lymphocyte Segmentation on Breast Cancer Histopathology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2041232","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5484937/05415659.pdf","startPage":"1676","endPage":"1689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2041232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Expectation\u2013Maximization-Driven Geodesic Active Contour With Overlap Resolution (EMaGACOR): Application to Lymphocyte Segmentation on Breast Cancer Histopathology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5415659/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11442108","pubMedId":"20172780","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expectation\u2013Maximization-Driven Geodesic Active Contour With Overlap Resolution (EMaGACOR): Application to Lymphocyte Segmentation on Breast Cancer Histopathology","sourcePdf":"tbme-fatakdawala-2041232.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119708S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5484937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"5484937","articleId":"5415659","onlineDate":"17 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5415665,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Piazza","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5484898/5415665/5415665-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniele Piazza (S'03\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering and the Laurea degree (high honors) in telecommunication engineering with specialization in radio-frequency communications from Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering with specialization in reconfigurable antennas and multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) communications from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, in 2009.","Since 2006, he has been with the Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, where he is currently a Researcher.

The benefits offered by each state (i.e., excited radiation pattern and polarization) of the RCPAs are investigated in both line-of-sight (LOS) and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The analysis shows the effectiveness of each array configuration in increasing the diversity level of the system and the amount of signal power received in LOS and NLOS communication links.

Support vector machine regression is employed for grade prediction. This is the first time that the nucleus region can be detected automatically in slit lamp images. The system is validated using clinical images and clinical ground truth on >5000 images. The success rate of structure detection is 95% and the average grading difference is 0.36 on a 5.0 scale.

Genetic algorithm is used for optimization and finding optimal control parameters. To indicate capability of controllers, three scenarios have been chosen. In the first scenario only SVC has been implemented for adjusting of control parameters. The second scenario has applied PSS solely in the system. Third scenario considers both SVC and PSS for finding optimal control parameters. Then the result will be compared. Two approaches have been applied for adjusting of SVC and PSS parameters. In the first approach objective function has been calculated according to system eigenvalues in only one operating point. But in the second approach adjusting of parameters by objective function have been calculated using system eigen values in several operating points. In latest approach six operating points in different loading levels (light, normal, heavy) have been selected to cover search space. The results show that although in the first approach system stability improvement in some system modes, others modes may be unstable. In contrast second approach leads to improvement all of system modes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Damping","Static VAr compensators","Power system stability","Power system dynamics","Power system interconnection","Power system security","Optimal control","Frequency","Power system planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","genetic algorithms","oscillations","power system stability","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system oscillation damping","static VAR compensator","genetic algorithm","power system stability enhancement","generator","optimal control parameters","system eigenvalues","objective function approach","system stability improvement approach"]}],"publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electric Power and Energy Conversion Systems, (EPECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electric Power and Energy Conversion Systems, (EPECS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5405665/5415682/05415692.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing power system oscillation damping using coordination between PSS and SVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing power system oscillation damping using coordination between PSS and SVC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415692/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415692/","accessionNumber":"11139627","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing power system oscillation damping using coordination between PSS and SVC","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"91120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060429S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5405665","isNumber":"5415682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5405665","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5415682","articleId":"5415692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"College of Engineering","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5415695,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Using low density parity check (LDPC) coding, detected data is continually improved by a detection structure that implements multiple iterations through a set of soft-input soft-output (SISO) and message-passing (MP) blocks. A specially constructed LDPC code is used to optimize performance in the presence of inter-symbol interference (ISI). Also, Reed-Solomon error correction coding (ECC) is retained for optimal data integrity.

The gains from TDMR come primarily from more powerful coding and signal processing algorithms that allow the bits to be packed more tightly on the disk, and yet be retrieved with acceptable error rates. In this paper, we present some preliminary results for an advanced channel model based on micromagnetic simulations, coined the Grain Flipping Probability model. This model requires a one-time computationally complex characterization phase, but subsequently provides fast and accurate two-dimensional (2-D) readback waveforms that include effects captured from micromagnetic simulations and the statistical effects derived from the granularity of the recording medium. We also show the performance of several detectors over a pre-existing TDMR channel model directly as a function of channel density rather than the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2035635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2035635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5415754/05415778.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Models and Detectors for Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Channel Models and Detectors for Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording","volume":"46","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415778/","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138047","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415778/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Models and Detectors for Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording","sourcePdf":"tmag-sann-2035635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07536S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5415754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5415754","articleId":"5415778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5415799,"authors":[{"name":"Xia Fang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/5412123/5415799/5415799-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xia Fang was born in Hubei, China, on January 14, 1984.

The main significance of this highly nontraditional timing recovery structure is that unlike the traditional PLLs, the loop's overall tracking ability and the steady-state jitter performance can be controlled more or less separately. The effective bandwidth of the PLL is set much lower than the traditional PLL for given input phase error fluctuations. As a result, the PLL jitter is made considerably smaller than traditional systems. On the other hand, the tracking ability of the overall loop depends largely on the window parameter associated with the phase estimator operating inside the Viterbi-like trellis detector. The window parameter has only a small effect on the loop jitter. The new PLL design is tested via tracking speed, timing jitter and error rate performance comparisons against a timing recovery method based on traditional PLL design. Simulation results in a turbo equalizer setting are also presented that validate the new PLL design methodology proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2035927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2035927","startPage":"830","endPage":"836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5415754/05415804.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Phase-Locked Loop Design: Understanding the Impact of a Phase-Tracking Channel Detector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"New Phase-Locked Loop Design: Understanding the Impact of a Phase-Tracking Channel Detector","volume":"46","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11138049","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5415804/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Phase-Locked Loop Design: Understanding the Impact of a Phase-Tracking Channel Detector","sourcePdf":"tmag-jmoon-2035927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094004S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5415754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5415754","articleId":"5415804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5415808,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroyuki Katada","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Katada","id":"37319684400"},{"name":"Mitsuhiro Hashimoto","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuhiro","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37268991800"},{"name":"Yosuke Urakami","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Yosuke","lastName":"Urakami","id":"37411468700"},{"name":"Sarbanoo Das","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Sarbanoo","lastName":"Das","id":"37278512000"},{"name":"Masato Shiimoto","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Shiimoto","id":"37393243900"},{"name":"Mikito Sugiyama","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Mikito","lastName":"Sugiyama","id":"37396230900"},{"name":"Takayuki Ichihara","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Ichihara","id":"37305231800"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Hoshiya","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Hoshiya","id":"37266594800"},{"name":"Kiwamu Tanahashi","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiwamu","lastName":"Tanahashi","id":"37314944900"},{"name":"Kazuhiro Nakamoto","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Odawara, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Nakamoto","id":"37321272600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5415808","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"We investigated medium noise using spinstand testing and calculation from the view point of head/media integration for 1 Tb/in \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, focusing on two kinds of noise sources: transition noise in the track center and track edge noise. A quantitative relationship between transition noise and magnetic cluster size of media was clarified. This relationship indicates that the transition noise can be reduced by reducing the magnetic cluster. In the track edge noise, there are two noise sources: edge line fluctuation and increase in transition length at the edges. The edge line fluctuation noise degrades low density SNR. We show that a high cross-track field gradient of writer and small magnetic cluster of media are effective to reduce the edge line fluctuation. The increase in transition length at the edges degrades high linear density SNR. The transition length at the edges increases as transition curvature increases. Both increase in transition length at the edges and large transition curvature make the magnetic write width narrow and erase band width wide.

This is envisioned to be achieved by shingled writing, a write-process in which the corner-writer partially overwrites the previously written adjacent track, effectively writing very closely spaced narrow tracks with no guard bands. Since the tracks are very narrow, they can be read by an array of read-elements whose spacing is equal to the narrow track pitch, creating a two-dimensional (2-D) array of readback signals (the two dimensions being the cross-track and the down-track dimensions). In the absence of an array of read elements, the same 2-D readback can be obtained by progressive scans of a single read element that reads one narrow track at a time and stores the readback signal in a 2-D array. In this paper, we present simple magnetic grain media models and shingled-write process models that capture the essence of TDMR. We assume that the granular recording medium consists of randomly shaped tiles (each tile represents a grain), randomly covering the medium plane. We then derive a suitable 2-D read/write process model. Using proper information-theoretic inequalities and bounding techniques, we derive methods to bound the capacities of TDMR channels. The results reveal that information capacities in excess of 0.6 user bits per grain are possible to attain over TDMR channels.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2035636","startPage":"812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5415754/05415815.pdf","endPage":"818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2035636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415815/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Modeling and Capacity Bounds for Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording","volume":"46","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5415815/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11138058","publicationDate":"March 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Modeling and Capacity Bounds for Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording","sourcePdf":"tmag-akavcic-2035636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051237S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5415754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5415754","articleId":"5415815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5415832,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Cheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5415817/5415832/5415832-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fu-Cheng Wang (S'01\u2013M'03) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1968.

RGB LED is the next-generational illuminant for general lighting or liquid crystal display backlighting. The most important feature for a polychromatic illuminant is color adjustability; however, for lighting applications using RGB LEDs, color is sensitive to temperature variations. Therefore, suitable control techniques are required to stabilize both luminous intensity and chromaticity coordinates. In this paper, a robust control system was proposed for achieving luminous intensity and color consistency for RGB LED lighting in a three-step process. First, a multivariable electrical-thermal model was used to obtain RGB LED luminous intensity, in which a lookup table served as a feedforward compensator for temperature and power variations. Second, robust control algorithms were applied for feedback control design. Finally, the designed robust controllers were implemented to control the luminous and chromatic outputs of the system. From the experimental results, the proposed multivariable robust control was deemed effective in providing steady luminous intensity and color for RGB LED lighting.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2026476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5415817/05415832.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"428","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2026476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariable Robust Control for a Red\u2013Green\u2013Blue LED Lighting System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Multivariable Robust Control for a Red\u2013Green\u2013Blue LED Lighting System","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5415832/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11149617","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariable Robust Control for a Red\u2013Green\u2013Blue LED Lighting System","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2026476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073348S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5415817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5415817","articleId":"5415832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5415853,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungchul Kwak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungchul","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37406622100"},{"name":"Sungeun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sungeun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407202900"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5415853","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Power system relaying","Power generation","Bandwidth","Digital relays","Degradation","System performance","Frequency division multiplexing","Power system modeling","Distributed power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","radio repeaters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase compensation","channel dispersion","variable gain relay OFDM systems","composite channel","symbol duration","power constant","channel length","long channel estimation","source-relay link channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF) relays","channel estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"We show that the length of a composite channel is regarded up to the whole symbol duration for variable-gain relay (VGR), which generates the received power constant instantaneously. The enlarged channel length causes system burden, which is due to long-channel estimation, i.e., an increase in pilot overhead, a decrease in bandwidth efficiency, and a degradation of system performance. To prevent this effect and minimize the length of the composite channel, phase compensation of the source-relay (S-R) link channel should be added to the VGR, although this addition increases complexity.

The elegance of the concept of service curve is due to intuitive convolution formulas that determine the data departures of a system from its arrivals and its service curve. This fundamental relation constitutes the basis of the network calculus and relates it to systems theory, however, under a different, so-called min-plus algebra. As in systems theory, the particular strength of the minplus convolution is the ability to concatenate tandem systems along a network path. This facilitates the notion of network service curve that has the expressiveness to characterize whole networks by a single transfer function. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art of the deterministic and the recent probabilistic network calculus. It discusses the concept of service curves, its use in the network calculus, and the relation to systems theory under the min-plus algebra. Service curve models of common schedulers and different types of networks are reviewed and methods for identification of a system's service curve representation from measurements are discussed. After recapitulating the state of knowledge on time-varying min-plus systems theory, stochastic service curve models are surveyed. These models allow utilizing the statistical multiplexing gain in a network calculus framework that features end-to-end network analysis by convolution of service curves.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey of deterministic and stochastic service curve models in the network calculus","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2010.020110.00019","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5415859/05415864.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2010.020110.00019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2010","displayDocTitle":"Survey of deterministic and stochastic service curve models in the network calculus","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5415864/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"First Quarter 2010","accessionNumber":"11120015","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of deterministic and stochastic service curve models in the network calculus","sourcePdf":"05fidler.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.338206S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5415859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5415859","articleId":"5415864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5415865,"authors":[{"name":"Hugues Mercier","affiliation":["Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/5415859/5415865/5415865-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hugues Mercier received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, in 1997, the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Montreal, Canada, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, in 2008.

This technology can enable broadband access for a large number of customers in the access/metro area, while decreasing capital and operational expenditures for the network operator. First, the paper reviews the evolutionary path of access networks and shows the drivers from technology and business perspectives for high bandwidth and low cost. A variety of research challenges in this field is reviewed, from optical components in the physical layer to the control and management issues in the upper layers. We discuss the requisites for optical sources, optical amplifiers, and optical receivers when used in networks with high transmission rate (10 Gbps) and large power attenuation (due to large split, transmission over 100 km and beyond, and propagation), and the key topological structures that allow to guarantee physical protection (tree-and-branch, ring-and-spur). Then, some relevant demonstrations of Long-Reach Optical Access Networks developed worldwide by different research institutes are presented. Finally, Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) algorithms that allow to mitigate the effect of the increased control-plane delay in an extended-reach network are investigated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2010.020110.00040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415859","startPage":"112","endPage":"123","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5415859/05415867.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-reach optical access networks: A survey of research challenges, demonstrations, and bandwidth assignment mechanisms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5415867/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Long-reach optical access networks: A survey of research challenges, demonstrations, and bandwidth assignment mechanisms","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"First Quarter 2010","accessionNumber":"11120020","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-reach optical access networks: A survey of research challenges, demonstrations, and bandwidth assignment mechanisms","sourcePdf":"08song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084826S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5415859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5415859","articleId":"5415867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5415876,"authors":[{"name":"Patnam Hanumantha Rao","affiliation":["SAMEER- Center for Electromagnetics, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Patnam Hanumantha","lastName":"Rao","id":"37723853100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5136-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5137-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5415876","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415876","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software radio","Cognitive radio","Computer architecture","Adaptive arrays","Frequency","Broadband antennas","Polarization","Directive antennas","Switches","Antenna accessories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","cognitive radio","polarisation","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna configuration","software defined radio","cognitive radio communication architecture","wideband antenna","polarization reconfigurable antenna","frequency reconfigurable antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Reconfigurable antennas"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415876","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Computing (ICWCSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Computing (ICWCSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406659/5415872/05415876.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna configurations for software defined radio and cognitive radio communication architecture","abstract":"Cognitive radio is a new concept that utilizes the spectrum efficiently by shifting the frequency bands with time and availability.

By performing simple transformations on sub-optimum partial transmit sequence (SOPTS), better PAPR reduction than the suboptimum PTS scheme is obtained with comparable computational complexity. There is also no need for side information to be transmitted to the receiver. To further evaluate their PAPR reductions we compare the proposed schemes with the suboptimum PTS scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415881","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Computing (ICWCSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Computing (ICWCSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406659/5415872/05415881.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An OGA based approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415881/","displayDocTitle":"An OGA based approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11120223","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415881/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An OGA based approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"P62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050512S","chronDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5406659","isNumber":"5415872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406659","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5415872","articleId":"5415881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5415883,"authors":[{"name":"P.

At the first level, relatively simple nodes with basic sensing devices are used as primary detectors of intrusions. The second-level sensor node is composed of a high performance FPGA that can be dynamically reconfigured for different applications, interfaced with the camera. Thus the proposed technique reduces redundant transmission, consumes less power and bandwidth.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable FPGA based architecture for surveillance systems in WSN","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Computing (ICWCSC)","doi":"10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415883","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Computing (ICWCSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406659/5415872/05415883.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5415883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable FPGA based architecture for surveillance systems in WSN","conferenceDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415883/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11120225","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable FPGA based architecture for surveillance systems in WSN","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"P60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080922S","chronDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5406659","isNumber":"5415872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406659","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5415872","articleId":"5415883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5415894,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The routing in packet switched multi-hop networks can be described as a classical combinatorial optimization problem i.e. a shortest path routing problem in graphs. The stress is on energy efficient routing where the network optimizes between efficient routing and maximizing life of the network. The results show that the GA is efficient for energy constrained WASNs due to their fastness in computation comparing to all other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415898","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Computing (ICWCSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406659/5415872/05415898.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Computing (ICWCSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient dynamic shortest path routing in wireless Ad hoc sensor networks using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency","Routing","Genetic algorithms","Patient monitoring","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Acoustic sensors","Military computing","Application specific integrated circuits","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","genetic algorithms","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient dynamic shortest path routing","wireless ad hoc sensor networks","genetic algorithm","combinatorial optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Combinatorial optimization","Dynamic shortest path routing problem","Genetic algorithm","Packet switched multi hop networks","Wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient dynamic shortest path routing in wireless Ad hoc sensor networks using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5415898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","conferenceDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11120238","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient dynamic shortest path routing in wireless Ad hoc sensor networks using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"P36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126563S","chronDate":"2-4 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5406659","isNumber":"5415872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406659","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5415872","articleId":"5415898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5415899,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As PCM exhibits access time slightly longer but in the same range as DRAMs, several recent studies have proposed to use PCMs for designing main memory systems. Unfortunately PCM technology suffers from a limited write endurance; typically each memory cell can be only be written a large but still limited number of times (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup>\n to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">9</sup>\n writes are reported for current technology). Till now, research proposals have essentially focused their attention on designing memory systems that will survive to the average behavior of conventional applications.However PCM memory systems should be designed to survive worst-case applications, i.e., malicious attacks targeting the physical destruction of the memory through overwriting a limited number of memory cells. In this paper, we propose the design of a secure PCM-based main memory that would by construction survive to overwrite attacks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/L-CA.2010.2","doi":"10.1109/L-CA.2010.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/10208/5481950/05415929.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5481950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Phase Change Memory as a Secure Main Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Phase Change Memory as a Secure Main Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5415929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11341228","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5415929/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Phase Change Memory as a Secure Main Memory","sourcePdf":"lca2010010005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0492S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"5481950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5481950","articleId":"5415929","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5415979,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Karargyris","affiliation":["Wright State University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/51/5415964/5415979/5415979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandros Karargyris has graduated from National Technological University of Athens, Greece.

This paper proposes an FPGA-based embedded system integrating hardware that accelerates the cryptographic algorithms used in the SSL/TLS protocol. OpenSSL, an open source implementation of the SLL v3 and TLS v1 protocol, is deployed in the proposed embedded system powered with a Nios-2 embedded soft-core processor. Nios2-Linux RTOS is applied, which serves to provide Ethernet connectivity, multitasking, and support for the OpenSSL library. Key cipher functions used in SSL-driven connections, which include AES-256 symmetric encryption, SHA-2 hashing, RSA-2048 publickey cryptography, are accelerated in hardware. The embedded cryptosystem is prototyped completely on an Altera Stratix II FPGA development board. Experimental results show significant improvements in performance of the SSL transactions when the proposed embedded cryptosystem is deployed in the networking system.","doi":"10.1109/ISMS.2010.89","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415926/5416031/05416065.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMS.2010.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416031","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Acceleration of OpenSSL Cryptographic Functions for High-Performance Internet Security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416065/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Acceleration of OpenSSL Cryptographic Functions for High-Performance Internet Security","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416065/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11141371","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Acceleration of OpenSSL Cryptographic Functions for High-Performance Internet Security","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"3973a374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042745S","chronDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415926","isNumber":"5416031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415926","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5416031","articleId":"5416065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416094,"authors":[{"name":"B.

HS is a stochastic meta-heuristic that is inspired from the improvisation process of musicians. Unlike Backpropagation, HS is non-trajectory driven. By modifying an existing improved version of HS & adopting a suitable ANN data representation, we propose a training technique where two of HS probabilistic parameters are determined dynamically based on the best-to-worst (BtW) harmony ratio in the current harmony memory instead of the improvisation count. This would be more suitable for ANN training since parameters and termination would depend on the quality of the attained solution. We have empirically tested and verified our technique by training an ANN with a benchmarking problem. In terms of overall training time and recognition, our results have revealed that our method is superior to both the original improved HS and standard Backpropagation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416110/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11141415","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416110/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Harmony Search Based Supervised Training of Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmony Search Based Supervised Training of Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"3973a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071486S","chronDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415926","isNumber":"5416031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415926","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5416031","articleId":"5416110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416111,"authors":[{"name":"Ladislava Sm\u00edtkov\u00e1 Janku","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, FEE, IKT Advanced Technologies, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ladislava Sm\u00edtkov\u00e1","lastName":"Janku","id":"37402095900"},{"name":"Katerina Hyniov\u00e1","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, FEE CTU Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Katerina","lastName":"Hyniov\u00e1","id":"37402095700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5985-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5984-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3973-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0662"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-0670"}],"articleNumber":"5416111","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416111","abstract":"This paper deals with the preliminary experiments on general audio segmentation using a MMI-supervised tree-based vector quantizer and feed-forward neural network.

GA offers a stochastic global optimization technique that might suffer from two major shortcomings: slow convergence time and impractical data representation. The effect of these shortcomings is more considerable in case of larger FFANN with larger dataset. Using a non-binary real-coded data representation we offer an enhancement to the generational GA used for the training of FFANN. Such enhancement would come in two fold: The first being a new strategy to process the strings of the population by allowing the fittest string to survive unchanged to the next population depending on its age. The second is to speed up fitness computation time through the utilization of known parallel processing techniques used for matrix multiplication. The implementation was carried on master-slaves architecture of commodity computers connected via Ethernet. Using a well-known benchmarking dataset, results show that our proposed technique is superior to the standard in terms of both the overall convergence time and processing time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416112/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11141417","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416112/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Training Feed-Forward Neural Networks Using a Parallel Genetic Algorithm with the Best Must Survive Strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training Feed-Forward Neural Networks Using a Parallel Genetic Algorithm with the Best Must Survive Strategy","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"3973a096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081799S","chronDate":"27-29 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415926","isNumber":"5416031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415926","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5416031","articleId":"5416112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416117,"authors":[{"name":"Faisal Alkhateeb","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology and Computer Science, Yarmauk University, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Faisal","lastName":"Alkhateeb","id":"37403040900"},{"name":"Eslam Al Maghayreh","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology and Computer Science, Yarmauk University, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Eslam Al","lastName":"Maghayreh","id":"37402038000"},{"name":"Shadi Aljawarneh","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Information Technology, Al-Isra University, Amman, Jordan"],"firstName":"Shadi","lastName":"Aljawarneh","id":"37085893607"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5985-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5984-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3973-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0662"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-0670"}],"articleNumber":"5416117","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"abstract":"A multi-agent system (MAS) is a system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents.

This network finds the model needed in the state-space equations of the EKF, where the state variables are the battery terminal voltage at the previous sample and the SOC at the present sample. Furthermore, the covariance matrix for the process noise in the EKF is estimated adaptively. The proposed method is implemented on a Li-Ion battery to estimate online the actual SOC of the battery.

In such situations, the use of fuzzy approaches becomes a viable alternative. However, the systems constructed on the base of type 1 fuzzy systems cannot directly handle the uncertainties associated with information or data in the knowledge base of the process. One possible way to alleviate the problem is to resort to the use of type 2 fuzzy systems. In this paper, the structure of a type 2 Takagi\u2013Sugeno\u2013Kang fuzzy neural system is presented, and its parameter update rule is derived based on fuzzy clustering and gradient learning algorithm. Its performance for identification and control of time-varying as well as some time-invariant plants is evaluated and compared with other approaches seen in the literature. It is seen that the proposed structure is a potential candidate for identification and control purposes of uncertain plants, with the uncertainties being handled adequately by type 2 fuzzy sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416278/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5416278/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Type 2 Fuzzy Neural Structure for Identification and Control of Time-Varying Plants","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Type 2 Fuzzy Neural Structure for Identification and Control of Time-Varying Plants","sourcePdf":"tie-abiyev-2043036-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100715S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5609238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"5609238","articleId":"5416278","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5416281,"authors":[{"name":"Jiming Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Industrial Process Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5609238/5416281/5416281-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiming Chen (M'08) received the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2005.","He was a Visiting Scholar at the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique (INRIA) and National University of Singapore, Singapore.

The global optimum of such connections of PV modules is generally equivalent with performing the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) on all the modules. The most important disturbance occurs when the irradiance levels of modules happen to be sensibly different from a module to another - in this case, voltage-limitation requirements may be broken. The proposed supervisory algorithm then attempts to establish the best suboptimal power regime. Validation has been achieved by MATLAB/Simulink numerical simulation in the case of a single-phase grid-connected PV system, where individual MPPTs have been implemented by an extremum-seeking control, a robust and less-knowledge-demanding perturb-and-observe method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2043041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5684364/05416284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2043041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5684364","startPage":"403","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter Photovoltaic Systems: Power Optimization Issues","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter Photovoltaic Systems: Power Optimization Issues","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742172","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5416284/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter Photovoltaic Systems: Power Optimization Issues","sourcePdf":"tie-bratcu-2043041-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086289S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5684364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"5684364","articleId":"5416284","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416286,"authors":[{"name":"Isaac Soares de Freitas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Para\u00edba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5609238/5416286/5416286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Isaac Soares de Freitas (S'04\u2013M'09) was born in Itaporanga, Brazil, in 1982.

The proposed model is designed to capture the complex motion that the LAD undergoes during the cardiac cycle. The key idea is to define a local coordinate system for the heart and to parameterize both the shape and motion of the LAD in a single framework. The shape of the LAD is modeled as a parametric generalized cylinder, and the motion during the heart cycle is modeled as a composite of three components, which are as follows: 1) longitudinal deformation, 2) radial displacement, and 3) angular displacement over the cardiac cycle. The proposed framework for the LAD shape-motion estimation is generic, since it does not assume any particular tubular shape. Results obtained for four human subjects using electron beam computed tomography data are in agreement with LAD shape-motion deformations reported in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416295/","volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5416295/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11510513","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"20176530","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Functional Morphology Analysis of the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery in EBCT Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional Morphology Analysis of the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery in EBCT Images","sourcePdf":"tbme-kakadiaris-2043254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105663S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5508692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5508692","articleId":"5416295","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5416300,"authors":[{"name":"Henrik Gollee","affiliation":["Scottish Centre for Innovation in Spinal Cord Injury, Glasgow, U.K.","Centre for Rehabilitation Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5508692/5416300/5416300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Henrik Gollee (M'00) graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany, in 1995, and received the Ph.D. degree in systems and control from the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K., in 1998.","He is currently a Lecturer at the Faculty of Engineering and the Director of the Centre for Rehabilitation Engineering, Glasgow University.

The approach was evaluated in 12 neurologically intact subjects to change the parameters and operating mode of an abdominal stimulation system for respiratory assistance. No major influence of the FES on the raw EEG signal could be observed. In tests with a self-paced task, a mean accuracy of more than 90% was achieved, with detection times of approximately 7.7 s and an average information transfer rate of 12.5 bits/min. There was no significant dependency of the accuracy or time of detection on the FES stimulation intensity.

Any alteration of the cell mechanics may cause human diseases. The osmotic condition is an important factor to the physiological environment, but its effect on RBCs has been little studied. To investigate this effect, robotic manipulation technology with optical tweezers is utilized in this paper to characterize the mechanical properties of RBCs in different osmotic conditions. The effectiveness of this technology is demonstrated first in the manipulation of microbeads. Then the optical tweezers are used to stretch RBCs to acquire the force-deformation relationships. To extract cell properties from the experimental data, a mechanical model is developed for RBCs in hypotonic conditions by extending our previous work , and the finite element model is utilized for RBCs in isotonic and hypertonic conditions. Through comparing the modeling results to the experimental data, the shear moduli of RBCs in different osmotic solutions are characterized, which shows that the cell stiffness increases with elevated osmolality. Furthermore, the property variation and potential biomedical significance of this study are discussed. In conclusion, this study indicates that the osmotic stress has a significant effect on the cell properties of human RBCs, which may provide insight into the pathology analysis and therapy of some human diseases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5484937/05416305.pdf","startPage":"1816","endPage":"1825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2042448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2042448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanical Characterization of Human Red Blood Cells Under Different Osmotic Conditions by Robotic Manipulation With Optical Tweezers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Red blood cells","Robots","Biomedical optical imaging","Mechanical factors","Diseases","Data mining","Finite element methods","Stress","Pathology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biomechanics","blood","cellular biophysics","diseases","elastic constants","medical robotics","molecular biophysics","osmosis","physiological models","radiation pressure","shear modulus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechanical characterization","human red blood cells","osmotic conditions","robotic manipulation","optical tweezers","physiological functions","mechanical properties","cell mechanics","human diseases","microbeads","force-deformation relationships","mechanical model","hypotonic conditions","finite element model","isotonic condition","shear moduli","cell stiffness","pathology analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell modeling","human red blood cell (RBC)","optical tweezers","osmotic stress","robotic manipulation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Calibration","Cell Shape","Elasticity","Erythrocytes","Erythrocytes","Finite Element Analysis","Humans","Micromanipulation","Micromanipulation","Microspheres","Models, Biological","Optical Tweezers","Osmotic Pressure","Robotics","Robotics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Mechanical Characterization of Human Red Blood Cells Under Different Osmotic Conditions by Robotic Manipulation With Optical Tweezers","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5416305/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11442088","pubMedId":"20176536","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanical Characterization of Human Red Blood Cells Under Different Osmotic Conditions by Robotic Manipulation With Optical Tweezers","sourcePdf":"tbme-tan-2042448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182761S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5484937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5484937","articleId":"5416305","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416306,"authors":[{"name":"Marcello Pucci","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems for Automation (ISSIA), Italian National Council of Research, Palermo, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5662271/5416306/5416306-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marcello Pucci (M'03) received the \u201cLaurea\u201d and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy, in 1997 and 2002, respectively.

The machine reference speed is then computed on the basis of the optimal tip speed ratio. For the experimental application, a back-to-back configuration with two voltage source converters has been considered, one on the machine side and the other on the grid side. The field-oriented control of the machine has been further integrated with an intelligent sensorless technique; in particular, the so-called total least squares (TLS) EXIN full-order observer has been adopted. Finally, a comparison with a classic perturb-and-observe MPPT has been made on a real wind-speed profile.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","volume":"58","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11692759","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416306/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural MPPT Control of Wind Generators With Induction Machines Without Speed Sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural MPPT Control of Wind Generators With Induction Machines Without Speed Sensors","sourcePdf":"tie-pucci-2043043-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076307S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5662271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5662271","articleId":"5416306","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416308,"authors":[{"name":"Reinhold No\u00e9","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Optical Communication and High-Frequency Engineering, Paderborn, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/5594752/5416308/5416308-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reinhold No\u00e9 (M\u201993\u2013SM\u201909) was born in Darmstadt, Germany, in 1960.

The first extension to the CMA enables a common carrier recovery (CCR) through differential phase compensation (DPC-CMA). The second extension adapts the CMA for quadrature amplitude modulation signals (CMA-QAM). Both extensions can be combined to form a DPC-CMA for QAM signals (DPC-CMA-QAM). A new, modified DDA (MDDA) considerably increases polarization tracking speeds compared to the original DDA (ODDA). It is also usable for QAM signals. The algorithms are compared in simulations of QPSK and 16-QAM transmission systems. The results show that the DPC extension for the CMA in combination with CCR doubles laser linewidth tolerance and also the CMA-QAM triples polarization control speed compared to the standard CMA for QAM signals. The MDDA is 1.6-4 times faster than the CMA variants and is, at least when QAM signals are transmitted, more hardware-efficient.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2039920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5594752/05416308.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2039920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic Polarization Control Algorithms for Coherent Optical Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416308/","displayDocTitle":"Electronic Polarization Control Algorithms for Coherent Optical Transmission","volume":"16","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11560877","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416308/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic Polarization Control Algorithms for Coherent Optical Transmission","sourcePdf":"jstqe-noe-2039920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062368S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5594752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5594752","articleId":"5416308","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416327,"authors":[{"name":"Shanthi Pavan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5545511/5416327/5416327-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shanthi Pavan (M'01) was born in 1973.

However, we lack an efficient, reliable, and secure BSN platform that can meet increasing needs in e-healthcare applications. Many such applications require a BSN to support multiple data rates with reliable and energyefficient data transmission. In this article we propose a secure and resource-aware BSN architecture to enable real-time healthcare monitoring, especially for secure wireless electrocardiogram data streaming and monitoring. A cross-layer framework was developed based on unequal resource allocation to support efficient biomedical data monitoring. In this framework important information (e.g., critical ECG data) is identified, and extra resources are allocated to protect it. Furthermore, BSN resource factors are exploited to guarantee a strict requirement of real-time performance. In this work we integrate biomedical information processing and transmission in a unified platform, where secure data transmission in a BSN proceeds with energy efficiency and minimum delay. In particular, we present a wearable ECG device consisting of small and low-power healthnode sensors for wireless three-lead ECG monitoring. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can support real-time wireless biomedical monitoring applications.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5416337/05416345.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"19","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2010.5416345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2010.5416345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource-aware secure ECG healthcare monitoring through body sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","displayDocTitle":"Resource-aware secure ECG healthcare monitoring through body sensor networks","htmlLink":"/document/5416345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11138272","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource-aware secure ECG healthcare monitoring through body sensor networks","sourcePdf":"008CHENLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059605S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5416337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"5416337","articleId":"5416345","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416346,"authors":[{"name":"Phond Phunchongharn","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Phond Phunchongharn (p.phond@win.trlabs.ca) received her B.E. in 2005 and her M.E. in 2007, both in computer engineering, from King Mongkut's University of Technology Thunburi.

However, using wireless communications technology in a healthcare environment poses two major challenges. First, the electromagnetic interference caused to bio-medical devices by wireless devices could critically affect their performance. Second, since different types of e-health applications have different priorities, access to the wireless channel by the corresponding devices needs to be prioritized. In this article we introduce a novel cognitive-radio-based approach to address these challenges in wireless communications for e-health applications in a hospital environment. First, the requirements for a wireless communications system to be used in a healthcare environment are identified, and potential applications of cognitive radio technology for e-health applications are discussed. Then a cognitive radio system is proposed for e-health applications in a hospital environment, which protects the medical devices from harmful interference by adapting the transmit power of wireless devices based on EMI constraints. An EMI-aware handshaking protocol is proposed for channel access by two different types of applications with different priorities. The performance of this cognitive radio system for e-health applications is evaluated through simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11138273","htmlLink":"/document/5416346/","displayDocTitle":"A cognitive radio system for e-health applications in a hospital environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cognitive radio system for e-health applications in a hospital environment","sourcePdf":"009HOSSAINLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06046S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5416337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5416337","articleId":"5416346","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5416350,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ming Li (mingli@ece.wpi.edu) received his B.E and M.E degrees from Beihang University, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

WBAN has shown great potential in improving healthcare quality, and thus has found a wide range of applications from ubiquitous health monitoring and computer assisted rehabilitation to emergency medical response systems. The security and privacy protection of the data collected from a WBAN, either while stored inside the WBAN or during their transmission outside of the WBAN, is a major unsolved concern, with challenges coming from stringent resource constraints of WBAN devices, and the high demand for both security/privacy and practicality/usability. In this article we look into two important data security issues: secure and dependable distributed data storage, and fine-grained distributed data access control for sensitive and private patient medical data. We discuss various practical issues that need to be taken into account while fulfilling the security and privacy requirements.

Key to its success are the 2.4 and 5 GHz unlicensed bands. The transmit power limitations imposed due to regulatory requirements limit the range (coverage) that can be achieved by WLANs in these bands. However, the demand for \"larger\" wireless infrastructure is emerging, ranging from office/university campuses to city-wide deployments. To overcome the limitations of singlehop communication, data packets need to traverse over multiple wireless hops, and wireless mesh networks are called for. Since 2004 Task Group S has been developing an amendment to the 802.11 standard to exactly address the aforementioned need for multihop communication. Besides introducing wireless frame forwarding and routing capabilities at the MAC layer, the 802.11s amendment brings new interworking and security. In this article, we provide insights into the latest developments in 802.11s and explain how the overall mesh concept fits into the 802 set of networking standards.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2010.5416357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5416337/05416357.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2010.5416357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE 802.11s: The WLAN Mesh Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416357/","displayDocTitle":"IEEE 802.11s: The WLAN Mesh Standard","volume":"17","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11138284","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416357/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE 802.11s: The WLAN Mesh Standard","sourcePdf":"020HIERTZLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054623S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5416337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"5416337","articleId":"5416357","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5416370,"authors":[{"name":"Martijn van Eenennaam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Martijn","lastName":"van Eenennaam","id":"37403964000"},{"name":"Wouter Klein Wolterink","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Wouter Klein","lastName":"Wolterink","id":"37403963800"},{"name":"Georgios Karagiannis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Karagiannis","id":"37339824600"},{"name":"Geert Heijenk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Heijenk","id":"37295586000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5685-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5687-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9857"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9865"}],"articleNumber":"5416370","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":699},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space exploration","Communication system traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Intelligent transportation systems","Traffic control","Space technology","Intelligent networks","Intelligent vehicles","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","adaptive control","control engineering computing","mobile radio","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent transportation systems","cooperative adaptive cruise control","vehicular traffic efficiency application","channel busy time model","beacon message"]}],"abstract":"Vehicular networking is an enabling technology for intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

However, there are trade-offs in the adoption of these technologies including data capacity, continuity of connections, energy use and contention with other users. We focus on short range technologies that support both near-neighbor communication, for safety applications, and multihop communications for message propagation. Due to frequent network partitioning, opportunistic message exchange is required for message propagation. Earlier studies reveal that messages are suitably propagated in both directions of traffic as vehicle traffic density increases. In this paper we consider asymmetries in traffic density caused by directionality. For example, `rush hour' traffic fills one direction of a roadway while the other direction can be sparse. Performance analysis indicates that data dissemination under asymmetry produces a corresponding asymmetry in message propagation in the direction of higher-density traffic. This result is framed in the context of traffic density regimes and is useful in the design of vehicular networks that leverage short range communications. For a fixed traffic density in one direction, an increase in density from 0 to 20 vehicles/km in the other direction, yields a corresponding increase of 500 m/s to 1000 m/s in the messaging performance depending upon the regime.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410727/5416359/05416376.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","doi":"10.1109/VNC.2009.5416376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNC.2009.5416376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of asymmetric traffic densities on delay tolerant vehicular ad hoc networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Disruption tolerant networking","Ad hoc networks","Road vehicles","Traffic control","Routing","Safety","Analytical models","Communications technology","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric traffic densities","delay tolerant vehicular ad hoc networks","near-neighbor communication","multihop communications","message propagation","vehicle density","data dissemination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of asymmetric traffic densities on delay tolerant vehicular ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416376/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141301","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of asymmetric traffic densities on delay tolerant vehicular ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"2922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080788S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5410727","isNumber":"5416359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410727","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5416359","articleId":"5416376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5416380,"authors":[{"name":"Levente Butty\u00e1n","affiliation":["Laboratory of Cryptography and Systems Security (CrySyS), Budapest University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Technology\uc2a0and\uc2a0Economics, Hungary"],"firstName":"Levente","lastName":"Butty\u00e1n","id":"37324283900"},{"name":"Tam\u00e1s Holczer","affiliation":["Laboratory of Cryptography and Systems Security (CrySyS), Budapest University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Technology\uc2a0and\uc2a0Economics, Hungary"],"firstName":"Tam\u00e1s","lastName":"Holczer","id":"37403131200"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Weimerskirch","affiliation":["Escrypt, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Weimerskirch","id":"37403130100"},{"name":"William Whyte","affiliation":["NTRU Cryptosystems, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Whyte","id":"37391245800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5685-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5687-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9857"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9865"}],"articleNumber":"5416380","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":90,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":670},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Heart beat","Vehicle safety","Cryptography","Communication system security","Vehicle driving","Laboratories","Protection","Accidents","Digital signatures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cryptography","data privacy","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SLOW","location privacy","VANET","vehicle untraceability","vehicle communications system","pseudonym changing scheme","vehicular ad hoc network"]}],"abstract":"Untraceability of vehicles is an important requirement in future vehicle communications systems. Unfortunately, heartbeat messages used by many safety applications provide a constant stream of location data, and without any protection measures, they make tracking of vehicles easy even for a passive eavesdropper. One commonly known solution is to transmit heartbeats under pseudonyms that are changed regularly in order to obfuscate the trajectory of vehicles. However, this approach is effective only if some silent period is kept during the pseudonym change and several vehicles change their pseudonyms nearly at the same time and at the same location. Unlike previous works that proposed explicit synchronization between a group of vehicles and/or required pseudonym change in a designated physical area (i.e., a static mix zone), we propose a much simpler approach that does not need any explicit cooperation between vehicles and any infrastructure support. Our basic idea is that vehicles should not transmit heartbeat messages when their speed drops below a given threshold, say 30 km/h, and they should change pseudonym during each such silent period. This ensures that vehicles stopping at traffic lights or moving slowly in a traffic jam will all refrain from transmitting heartbeats and change their pseudonyms nearly at the same time and location. Thus, our scheme ensures both silent periods and synchronized pseudonym change in time and space, but it does so in an implicit way. We also argue that the risk of a fatal accident at a slow speed is low, and therefore, our scheme does not seriously impact safety-of-life. In addition, refraining from sending heartbeat messages when moving at low speed also relieves vehicles of the burden of verifying a potentially large amount of digital signatures, and thus, makes it possible to implement vehicle communications with less expensive equipments.","doi":"10.1109/VNC.2009.5416380","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410727/5416359/05416380.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNC.2009.5416380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLOW: A Practical pseudonym changing scheme for location privacy in VANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416380/","displayDocTitle":"SLOW: A Practical pseudonym changing scheme for location privacy in VANETs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141305","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416380/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLOW: A Practical pseudonym changing scheme for location privacy in VANETs","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"2911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051536S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5410727","isNumber":"5416359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410727","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5416359","articleId":"5416380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5416382,"authors":[{"name":"Georges Challita","affiliation":["Litis Laboratory, INSA Rouen, Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, France"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Challita","id":"37320394700"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Mousset","affiliation":["Litis Laboratory, INSA Rouen, Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Mousset","id":"37283480800"},{"name":"Fawzi Nashashibi","affiliation":["IMARA Team of INRIA Rocquencourt and the Robotics Center, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Fawzi","lastName":"Nashashibi","id":"38492117500"},{"name":"Abdelaziz Bensrhair","affiliation":["Litis Laboratory, INSA Rouen, Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, France"],"firstName":"Abdelaziz","lastName":"Bensrhair","id":"37284718700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5685-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5687-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9857"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9865"}],"articleNumber":"5416382","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Machine vision","Mobile communication","Communication system security","Road vehicles","Vehicle driving","Mobile ad hoc networks","Urban areas","Signal resolution","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","Global Positioning System","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced driver assistance systems","V2V communications","vision systems","GPS receivers","intervehicle cooperation","wireless mobile ad hoc network","particle filter"]}],"abstract":"The advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS systems) based on cooperation between vehicles can offer serious perspectives to the road security.

Glass is an excellent substrate material because of matched coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to silicon, high thermal load, dielectric constant and high optical transparency over a wide wavelength range. Commercially available thin glass foils can be used as substrate materials for electronic and optoelectronic modules. The goal of our ongoing development is to make glass based packaging competitive with polymer (e.g. chip-in-polymer) or silicon based packaging (e.g. silicon-through-via, stacked dies by wire bonding). Our work is focused on conductor trace and through-via realization as well as optical lightwave circuit integration using glass as a substrate. For through-glass-vias, holes were drilled in glass wafers by different laser technologies and evaluated. Also, optical integration of waveguides and mirrors in glass substrates were investigated. This paper presents basic design rules and a selection of technologies for glass based SiP as well as a process flow for glass interposer applications.","doi":"10.1109/EPTC.2009.5416411","publicationTitle":"2009 11th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398729/5416395/05416411.pdf","startPage":"930","endPage":"935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPTC.2009.5416411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonic System-in-Package technologies using thin glass substrates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416411/","displayDocTitle":"Photonic System-in-Package technologies using thin glass substrates","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11140973","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416411/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonic System-in-Package technologies using thin glass substrates","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"G43P0246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06148S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398729","isNumber":"5416395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398729","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5416395","articleId":"5416411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416440,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The principal advantage of metallic PCMs over other materials include: (i) much greater energy storage per unit volume than organic PCMs; and (ii) much higher thermal conductivity than both organics and inorganic salt PCMs, which allow rapid heating and energy capture. This paper presents recent results on the development of metallic TIM and PCMs for energy storage, processed by LPS of a high melting phase (HMP) with a low melting phase (LMP). A discussion of processing issues, resultant properties, and modeling results expounding the benefits of these materials is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

To overcome these challenges, different types of capillary flow underfill, bump layout designs and bump types were evaluated and a quick reliability assessment was used to select the materials and test vehicle parameters for final assembly and reliability assessment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assembly and reliability of micro-bumped chips with Through-silicon Vias (TSV)

An interposer test chip of 25 \u00d7 25 mm size, has been designed with full array TSVs of 50 um size vias at 300 um pitch. TSVs of aspect ratio 4 are formed on 8 inch wafer using DRIE process and these vias are isolated by thermal oxide, followed by barrier/seed layer of Ti/Cu deposition. TSVs are filled with solid copper (Cu) using optimized pulse reverse damascene electroplating and Cu chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process also developed to remove the over burden copper with minimum dishing. Multi layer front side metallization process has been demonstrated using electroplated Cu as re-distribution layers (RDL) and spin-on-dielectrics as RDL passivation. Solid Cu filled TSVs are exposed at the backside of the TSVs using backgrinding and Cu CMP. Thin wafer handling process was developed for backside metallization on 200 um thick interposer wafers using support wafer with temporary adhesive bonding. Low temperature dielectric process has been optimized for backside via passivation to isolate the vias from surrounding silicon and backside RDL process as temporary adhesive can not withstand for high temperature processes. The support wafer is de-bonded by sliding at high temperature, followed by cleaning of temporary adhesive material on the front side of interposer wafer using cleaning chemical. TSV interposer of 200 um thickness has been fabricated successfully and the vias are in very good connectivity from the top to the bottom. Complete interposer fabrication process issues and solutions have been discussed.","doi":"10.1109/EPTC.2009.5416509","publicationTitle":"2009 11th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398729/5416395/05416509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPTC.2009.5416509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416395","startPage":"431","endPage":"437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TSV interposer fabrication for 3D IC packaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TSV interposer fabrication for 3D IC packaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416509/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141066","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5416509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TSV interposer fabrication for 3D IC packaging","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"D22P0409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066554S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398729","isNumber":"5416395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398729","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5416395","articleId":"5416509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5416555,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Xie","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics (IME), A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274139800"},{"name":"Michelle Chew","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics (IME), A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chew","id":"37298262200"},{"name":"C.S.

Here, two methods are described for exploiting prior signatures. First, a physics-informed statistical method for evolving in-scene signatures over time is derived.

The elegant property of the technique is that it can enhance images by reducing undesirable intensity variability within the objects in the image, while improving SNR and enhancing the contrast of the edges in scalar and, more recently, vector-valued images, such as color, multispectral, and hyperspectral imagery. In this paper, we present an alternative hyperspectral anisotropic diffusion scheme that takes into account the recent advances and the specificities of hyperspectral remote sensing. In addition, the proposed anisotropic diffusion algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of hyperspectral imagery by reducing the spatial and spectral variability of the image, while preserving the edges of objects. It is also revealed that the additive operator splitting scheme of our method can increase computer efficiency. Qualitative experiments, based on a real hyperspectral remote sensing image, show significant improvements in visual effects when using our method. Quantitative analyses, based on classification accuracies, confirm the superiority and validity of the proposed diffusion algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5416584/05416595.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2009.2037800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2009.2037800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anisotropic Diffusion for Hyperspectral Imagery Enhancement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Hyperspectral imaging","Hyperspectral sensors","Remote sensing","Smoothing methods","Image edge detection","Sensor systems","Remote monitoring","Laboratories","Geology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anisotropic diffusion","hyperspectral imagery enhancement","image classification","image enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anisotropic diffusion","hyperspectral","image classification","image enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Anisotropic Diffusion for Hyperspectral Imagery Enhancement","volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5416595/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138265","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anisotropic Diffusion for Hyperspectral Imagery Enhancement","sourcePdf":"jsen-wang-2037800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099339S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5416584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5416584","articleId":"5416595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5416626,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Pan","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Pan","id":"37307880000"},{"name":"John Kim","affiliation":["KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311384600"},{"name":"Gokhan Memik","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Memik","id":"38367265800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5659-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5658-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5657-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-0897"}],"articleNumber":"5416626","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":131,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":899},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Energy consumption","Telecommunication traffic","Network-on-a-chip","Optical buffering","Scalability","Delay","Bandwidth","Optical losses","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","nanophotonics","network-on-chip","photonic switching systems","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel sharing","energy efficient nanophotonic crossbar architecture","FlexiShare","network-on-chip","high static power consumption","photonic token-stream mechanism","channel arbitration","credit distribution","router complexity","electrical power consumption","token-stream arbitrated conventional crossbar","extracted trace traffic","MineBench","SPLASH-2"]}],"abstract":"On-chip network is becoming critical to the scalability of future many-core architectures. Recently, nanophotonics has been proposed for on-chip networks because of its low latency and high bandwidth. However, nanophotonics has relatively high static power consumption, which can lead to inefficient architectures. In this work, we propose FlexiShare - a nanophotonic crossbar architecture that minimizes static power consumption by fully sharing a reduced number of channels across the network. To enable efficient global sharing, we decouple the allocation of the channels and the buffers, and introduce novel photonic token-stream mechanism for channel arbitration and credit distribution The flexibility of FlexiShare introduces additional router complexity and electrical power consumption. However, with the reduced number of optical channels, the overall power consumption is reduced without loss in performance. Our evaluation shows that the proposed token-stream arbitration applied to a conventional crossbar design improves network throughput by 5.5\u00d7 under permutation traffic. In addition, FlexiShare achieves similar performance as a token-stream arbitrated conventional crossbar using only half the amount of channels under balanced, distributed traffic. With the extracted trace traffic from MineBench and SPLASH-2, FlexiShare can further reduce the amount of channels by up to 87.5%, while still providing better performance - resulting in up to 72% reduction in power consumption compared to the best alternative.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FlexiShare: Channel sharing for an energy-efficient nanophotonic crossbar","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416626","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416626.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"FlexiShare: Channel sharing for an energy-efficient nanophotonic crossbar","conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416626/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11246497","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FlexiShare: Channel sharing for an energy-efficient nanophotonic crossbar","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076798S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416628,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Hyuk Woo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Dong Hyuk","lastName":"Woo","id":"37595936800"},{"name":"Nak Hee Seong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Nak Hee","lastName":"Seong","id":"37595914600"},{"name":"Dean L.

Several prior studies have demonstrated that this memory bandwidth problem can be addressed by employing a 3D-stacked memory architecture, which provides a wide, high frequency memory-bus interface. Although previous 3D proposals already provide as much bandwidth as a traditional L2 cache can consume, the dense through-silicon-vias (TSVs) of 3D chip stacks can provide still more bandwidth. In this paper, we contest that we need to re-architect our memory hierarchy, including the L2 cache and DRAM interface, so that it can take full advantage of this massive bandwidth. Our technique, SMART-3D, is a new 3D-stacked memory architecture with a vertical L2 fetch/write-back network using a large array of TSVs. Simply stated, we leverage the TSV bandwidth to hide latency behind very large data transfers. We analyze the design trade-offs for the DRAM arrays, careful enough to avoid compromising the DRAM density because of TSV placement. Moreover, we propose an efficient mechanism to manage the false sharing problem when implementing SMART-3D in a multi-socket system. For single-threaded memory-intensive applications, the SMART-3D architecture achieves speedups from 1.53 to 2.14 over planar designs and from 1.27 to 1.72 over prior 3D designs. We achieve similar speedups for multi-program and multi-threaded workloads on multi-core and multi-socket processors. Furthermore, SMART-3D can even lower the energy consumption in the L2 cache and 3D DRAM for it reduces the total number of row buffer misses.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416628","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416628.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An optimized 3D-stacked memory architecture by exploiting excessive, high-density TSV bandwidth","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416628/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11246492","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimized 3D-stacked memory architecture by exploiting excessive, high-density TSV bandwidth","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121029S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416629,"authors":[{"name":"Arijit Biswas","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Arijit","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37396210000"},{"name":"Charles Recchia","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Recchia","id":"37402617600"},{"name":"Shubhendu S.

This paper explains how an increase in the cache tag's Architectural Vulnerability Factor or AVF caused such a super-linear increase in the DUE rate. AVF expresses the fraction of faults that become user-visible errors. Our hypothesis is that this increase in AVF is caused by a super-linear increase in \u00bfdirty\u00bf data residence times in the L2 cache. Using proton beam irradiation, we measured the DUE rates from the write-back cache tags and analyzed the data to show that our hypothesis holds. We utilized a combination of simulation and measurements to help develop and prove this hypothesis. Our investigation reveals two methods by which dirty line residency causes super-linear increases in the L2 cache tag's AVF. One is a reduction in the miss rates as we move to the larger cache part, resulting in fewer evictions of data required for architecturally correct execution. The second is the occurrence of strided cache access patterns, which cause a significant increase in the \u00bfdirty\u00bf residency times of cache lines without increasing the cache miss rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explaining cache SER anomaly using DUE AVF measurement","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416629","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416629.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Explaining cache SER anomaly using DUE AVF measurement","conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416629/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11246516","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explaining cache SER anomaly using DUE AVF measurement","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056725S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416635,"authors":[{"name":"Jason E.

Graphite is capable of accelerating simulations by distributing them across multiple commodity Linux machines. When using multiple machines, it provides the illusion of a single process with a single, shared address space, allowing it to run off-the-shelf pthread applications with no source code modification. Our results demonstrate that Graphite can simulate target architectures containing over 1000 cores on ten 8-core servers. Performance scales well as more machines are added with near linear speedup in many cases.

This longstanding problem is further exacerbated in the multi-core processor era. Existing solutions address the simulation problem by either sampling the simulated instruction stream or by mapping the simulation models on FPGAs; these approaches achieve substantial simulation speedups while simulating performance in a cycle-accurate manner. This paper proposes interval simulation which takes a completely different approach: interval simulation raises the level of abstraction and replaces the core-level cycle-accurate simulation model by a mechanistic analytical model. The analytical model estimates core-level performance by analyzing intervals, or the timing between two miss events (branch mispredictions and TLB/cache misses); the miss events are determined through simulation of the memory hierarchy, cache coherence protocol, interconnection network and branch predictor. By raising the level of abstraction, interval simulation reduces both development time and evaluation time. Our experimental results using the SPEC CPU2000 and PARSEC benchmark suites and the M5 multi-core simulator, show good accuracy up to eight cores (average error of 4.6% and max error of 11% for the multi-threaded full-system workloads), while achieving a one order of magnitude simulation speedup compared to cycle-accurate simulation. Moreover, interval simulation is easy to implement: our implementation of the mechanistic analytical model incurs only one thousand lines of code. Its high accuracy, fast simulation speed and ease-of-use make interval simulation a useful complement to the architect's toolbox for exploring system-level and high-level micro-architecture trade-offs.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416636","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416636.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interval simulation: Raising the level of abstraction in architectural simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416636/","displayDocTitle":"Interval simulation: Raising the level of abstraction in architectural simulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11246518","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416636/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interval simulation: Raising the level of abstraction in architectural simulation","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09149S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416642,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowei Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37403105000"},{"name":"Niti Madan","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Niti","lastName":"Madan","id":"37393716300"},{"name":"Li Zhao","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292355100"},{"name":"Mike Upton","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Upton","id":"37387713800"},{"name":"Ravishankar Iyer","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Ravishankar","lastName":"Iyer","id":"37065928100"},{"name":"Srihari Makineni","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Srihari","lastName":"Makineni","id":"37281654500"},{"name":"Donald Newell","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Newell","id":"37272506400"},{"name":"Yan Solihin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Solihin","id":"37282584700"},{"name":"Rajeev Balasubramonian","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Balasubramonian","id":"37391836500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5659-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5658-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5657-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-0897"}],"articleNumber":"5416642","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1149},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416642","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Random access memory","Bandwidth","Computer architecture","Delay","Costs","Organizing","Multicore processing","Throughput","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CHOP","adaptive filter based DRAM caching","CMP server platforms","manycore architectures","on-chip tag area","caching hot pages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM cache","CHOP","adaptive filter","hot page","filter cache"]}],"abstract":"As manycore architectures enable a large number of cores on the die, a key challenge that emerges is the availability of memory bandwidth with conventional DRAM solutions. To address this challenge, integration of large DRAM caches that provide as much as 5\u00d7 higher bandwidth and as low as 1/3rd of the latency (as compared to conventional DRAM) is very promising. However, organizing and implementing a large DRAM cache is challenging because of two primary tradeoffs: (a) DRAM caches at cache line granularity require too large an on-chip tag area that makes it undesirable and (b) DRAM caches with larger page granularity require too much bandwidth because the miss rate does not reduce enough to overcome the bandwidth increase. In this paper, we propose CHOP (Caching HOt Pages) in DRAM caches to address these challenges. We study several filter-based DRAM caching techniques: (a) a filter cache (CHOP-FC) that profiles pages and determines the hot subset of pages to allocate into the DRAM cache, (b) a memory-based filter cache (CHOP-MFC) that spills and fills filter state to improve the accuracy and reduce the size of the filter cache and (c) an adaptive DRAM caching technique (CHOP-AFC) to determine when the filter cache should be enabled and disabled for DRAM caching. We conduct detailed simulations with server workloads to show that our filter-based DRAM caching techniques achieve the following: (a) on average over 30% performance improvement over previous solutions, (b) several magnitudes lower area overhead in tag space required for cache-line based DRAM caches, (c) significantly lower memory bandwidth consumption as compared to page-granular DRAM caches.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416642","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CHOP: Adaptive filter-based DRAM caching for CMP server platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"CHOP: Adaptive filter-based DRAM caching for CMP server platforms","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416642/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11246524","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416642/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CHOP: Adaptive filter-based DRAM caching for CMP server platforms","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077975S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5416645,"authors":[{"name":"Moinuddin K.

A characteristic of PCM is that it has write latency much higher than read latency. A higher write latency can typically be tolerated using buffers. However, once a write request is scheduled for service to a bank, it can still cause increased latency for later arriving read requests to the same bank. We show that for the baseline PCM system with read-priority scheduling, the write requests increase the effective read latency to 2.3x (on average), causing significant performance degradation. To reduce the read latency of PCM devices under such scenarios, we propose adaptive Write Cancellation policies. Such policies can abort the processing of a scheduled write requests if a read request arrives to the same bank within a predetermined period. We also propose Write Pausing, which exploits the iterative write algorithms used in PCM to pause at the end of each write iteration to service any pending reads. For the baseline system, the proposed technique removes 75% of the latency increase incurred by read requests and improves overall system performance by 46% (on average), while requiring negligible hardware and simple extensions to PCM controller.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416645","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416645.pdf","endPage":"11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416645/","displayDocTitle":"Improving read performance of Phase Change Memories via Write Cancellation and Write Pausing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5416645/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11246526","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving read performance of Phase Change Memories via Write Cancellation and Write Pausing","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077168S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416646,"authors":[{"name":"Mingsong Bi","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"firstName":"Mingsong","lastName":"Bi","id":"37408134600"},{"name":"Ran Duan","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Duan","id":"37411157300"},{"name":"Chris Gniady","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Gniady","id":"37302957700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5659-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5658-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5657-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-0897"}],"articleNumber":"5416646","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":254},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416646","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Energy management","Random access memory","Memory management","Power system management","Energy consumption","Hardware","Operating systems","Degradation","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","operating system kernels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-hiding energy management mechanisms","DRAM","data-intensive applications","physical memory","buffer cache","power management","energy consumption","I-O handling routines","OS kernel","memory state transition","high memory energy savings"]}],"abstract":"Current trends in data-intensive applications increase the demand for larger physical memory, resulting in the memory subsystem consuming a significant portion of system's energy. Furthermore, data-intensive applications heavily rely on a large buffer cache that occupies a majority of physical memory. Subsequently, we are focusing on the power management for physical memory dedicated to the buffer cache. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce energy consumption by transitioning DRAM into low-power states. However, transitions between different power states incur delays and may affect whole system performance. We take advantage of the I/O handling routines in the OS kernel to hide the delay incurred by the memory state transition so that performance degradation is minimized while maintaining high memory energy savings. Our evaluation shows that the best of the proposed mechanisms hides almost all transition latencies while only consuming 3% more energy as compared to the existing on-demand mechanism, which can expose significant delays.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416646","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416646.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Hiding energy management mechanisms for DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Hiding energy management mechanisms for DRAM","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5416646/","accessionNumber":"11246519","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Hiding energy management mechanisms for DRAM","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070388S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5416650,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyu Sun","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404006100"},{"name":"Yongsoo Joo","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yongsoo","lastName":"Joo","id":"37331682000"},{"name":"Yibo Chen","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yibo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407069300"},{"name":"Dimin Niu","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Dimin","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409787700"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37275778900"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies LLC, China"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37407153400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5659-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5658-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5657-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-0897"}],"articleNumber":"5416650","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416650","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Energy storage","Energy consumption","Phase change random access memory","Hard disks","File systems","Read-write memory","Random access memory","Computer buffers","Flash memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","memory architecture","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid solid-state storage architecture","NAND flash memory","erase-before-write requirement","log-based structures","phase change random access memory","energy consumption","erase operations","PRAM log region"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, many systems have employed NAND flash memory as storage devices because of its advantages of higher performance (compared to the traditional hard disk drive), high-density, random-access, increasing capacity, and falling cost. On the other hand, the performance of NAND flash memory is limited by its \u00bferase-before-write\u00bf requirement. Log-based structures have been used to alleviate this problem by writing updated data to the clean space. Prior log-based methods, however, cannot avoid excessive erase operations when there are frequent updates, which quickly consume free pages, especially when some data are updated repeatedly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture for the NAND flash memory storage, of which the log region is implemented using phase change random access memory (PRAM). Compared to traditional log-based architectures, it has the following advantages: (1) the PRAM log region allows in-place updating so that it significantly improves the usage efficiency of log pages by eliminating out-of-date log records; (2) it greatly reduces the traffic of reading from the NAND flash memory storage since the size of logs loaded for the read operation is decreased; (3) the energy consumption of the storage system is reduced as the overhead of writing and reading log data is decreased with the PRAM log region; (4) the lifetime of NAND flash memory is increased because the number of erase operations are reduced. To facilitate the PRAM log region, we propose several management policies. The simulation results show that our proposed methods can substantially improve the performance, energy consumption, and lifetime of the NAND flash memory storage\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416650","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416650.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid solid-state storage architecture for the performance, energy consumption, and lifetime improvement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid solid-state storage architecture for the performance, energy consumption, and lifetime improvement","conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11246505","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416650/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid solid-state storage architecture for the performance, energy consumption, and lifetime improvement","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065793S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416652,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew B.

Any scaling beyond the critical voltage results in exceeding the maximum allowable error rate, i.e., there are more timing errors than can be effectively and gainfully detected or corrected by an error-tolerance mechanism. This limits the effectiveness of voltage scaling as a knob for reliability/power tradeoffs. In this paper, we present power-aware slack redistribution, a novel design-level approach to allow voltage/reliability tradeoffs in processors. Techniques based on power-aware slack redistribution reapportion timing slack of the frequently-occurring, near-critical timing paths of a processor in a power- and area-efficient manner, such that we increase the range of voltages over which the incidence of operational (timing) errors is acceptable. This results in soft architectures - designs that fail gracefully, allowing us to perform reliability/power tradeoffs by reducing voltage up to the point that produces maximum allowable errors for our application. The goal of our optimization is to minimize the voltage at which a soft architecture encounters the maximum allowable error rate, thus maximizing the range over which voltage scaling is possible and minimizing power consumption for a given error rate. Our experiments demonstrate 23% power savings over the baseline design at an error rate of 1%. Observed power reductions are 29%, 29%, 19%, and 20% for error rates of 2%, 4%, 8%, and 16% respectively. Benefits are higher in the face of error recovery using Razor.

The scheduling algorithm employed by these memory controllers has a significant effect on system throughput, so choosing an efficient scheduling algorithm is important. The scheduling algorithm also needs to be scalable - as the number of cores increases, the number of memory controllers shared by the cores should also increase to provide sufficient bandwidth to feed the cores. Unfortunately, previous memory scheduling algorithms are inefficient with respect to system throughput and/or are designed for a single memory controller and do not scale well to multiple memory controllers, requiring significant finegrained coordination among controllers. This paper proposes ATLAS (Adaptive per-Thread Least-Attained-Service memory scheduling), a fundamentally new memory scheduling technique that improves system throughput without requiring significant coordination among memory controllers. The key idea is to periodically order threads based on the service they have attained from the memory controllers so far, and prioritize those threads that have attained the least service over others in each period. The idea of favoring threads with least-attained-service is borrowed from the queueing theory literature, where, in the context of a single-server queue it is known that least-attained-service optimally schedules jobs, assuming a Pareto (or any decreasing hazard rate) workload distribution. After verifying that our workloads have this characteristic, we show that our implementation of least-attained-service thread prioritization reduces the time the cores spend stalling and significantly improves system throughput. Furthermore, since the periods over which we accumulate the attained service are long, the controllers coordinate very infrequently to form the ordering of threads, thereby making ATLAS scalable to many controllers. We evaluate ATLAS on a wide variety of multiprogrammed SPEC 2006 workloads and systems with 4-32 cores and 1-16 memory controllers, and compare its performance to five previously proposed scheduling algorithms. Averaged over 32 workloads on a 24-core system with 4 controllers, ATLAS improves instruction throughput by 10.8%, and system throughput by 8.4%, compared to PAR-BS, the best previous CMP memory scheduling algorithm. ATLAS's performance benefit increases as the number of cores increases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Control systems","Throughput","Multicore processing","Queueing analysis","Bandwidth","Feeds","Algorithm design and analysis","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital storage","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","Pareto distribution","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip multiprocessor","scheduling algorithm","multiple memory controllers","ATLAS memory scheduling","adaptive per-thread least-attained-service","single-server queue","Pareto workload distribution","multiprogrammed SPEC 2006 workloads"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416658","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416658","displayPublicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410726/5416625/05416658.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2010.5416658","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416625","publicationTitle":"HPCA - 16 2010 The Sixteenth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATLAS: A scalable and high-performance scheduling algorithm for multiple memory controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ATLAS: A scalable and high-performance scheduling algorithm for multiple memory controllers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416658/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","conferenceDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416658/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11246515","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATLAS: A scalable and high-performance scheduling algorithm for multiple memory controllers","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.220451S","chronDate":"9-14 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410726","isNumber":"5416625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410726","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5416625","articleId":"5416658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5416674,"authors":[{"name":"Dominique Guinard","affiliation":["SAP Research and Institute of Pervasive Computing, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/5560013/5416674/5416674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dominique Guinard received the BSc degree in computer science and management and the MSc degree in computer science from the Universities of Fribourg and Bern.

In such infrastructures, composed of large numbers of networked, resource-limited devices, the discovery of services and on-demand provisioning of missing functionality is a significant challenge. We propose a process and a suitable system architecture that enables developers and business process designers to dynamically query, select, and use running instances of real-world services (i.e., services running on physical devices) or even deploy new ones on-demand, all in the context of composite, real-world business applications.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2010.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/5560013/05416674.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2010.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interacting with the SOA-Based Internet of Things: Discovery, Query, Selection, and On-Demand Provisioning of Web Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Interacting with the SOA-Based Internet of Things: Discovery, Query, Selection, and On-Demand Provisioning of Web Services","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416674/","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11501323","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416674/","volume":"3","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interacting with the SOA-Based Internet of Things: Discovery, Query, Selection, and On-Demand Provisioning of Web Services","sourcePdf":"tsc2010030223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078015S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"5560013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"456","xplore-issue":"5560013","articleId":"5416674","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5416676,"authors":[{"name":"Saras Saraswathi","affiliation":["Center of Bioinformatics and Biological Statistics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/5686865/5416676/5416676-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saras Saraswathi received the bachelor of arts degree in mathematics from the University of Delhi, India, in 1977, the master's degree in computer science from Old Dominion University in 1985, and the MS degree in bioinformatics from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2007.

Utilizing the analytical analysis, our accelerator reduces in the average number of cycles executed per instruction up to 50 percent for one of the CPUs in the multicore system.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.41","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5586714/05416684.pdf","startPage":"1494","endPage":"1507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache-Based Memory Copy Hardware Accelerator for Multicore Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416684/","displayDocTitle":"Cache-Based Memory Copy Hardware Accelerator for Multicore Systems","volume":"59","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416684/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11556710","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache-Based Memory Copy Hardware Accelerator for Multicore Systems","sourcePdf":"ttc2010111494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105456S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5586714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5586714","articleId":"5416684","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416685,"authors":[{"name":"Azzedine Boukerche","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5452823/5416685/5416685-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Azzedine Boukerche is a full professor of computer science and holds a Canada research chair position at the University of Ottawa.

Biological sequence comparison is an important operation in Bioinformatics because it is used to determine how similar two sequences are. As a result of this operation, one or more alignments are produced. DIALIGN is an exact algorithm that uses dynamic programming to obtain optimal biological sequence alignments in quadratic space and time. One effective way to accelerate DIALIGN is to design FPGA-based architectures to execute it. Nevertheless, the complete retrieval of an alignment in hardware requires modifications on the original algorithm because it executes in quadratic space. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two FPGA-based accelerators executing DIALIGN in linear space: one to obtain the optimal DIALIGN score (DIALIGN-Score) and one to retrieve the DIALIGN alignment (DIALIGN-Alignment). Because it appears to be no documented variant of the DIALIGN algorithm that produces alignments in linear space, we here propose a linear space variant of the DIALIGN algorithm and have designed the DIALIGN-Alignment accelerator to implement it. The experimental results show that impressive speedups can be obtained with both accelerators when comparing long biological sequences: the DIALIGN-Score accelerator achieved a speedup of 383.4 and the DIALIGN-Alignment accelerator reached a speedup of 141.38.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5452823/05416685.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hardware Accelerator for the Fast Retrieval of DIALIGN Biological Sequence Alignments in Linear Space","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.42","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416685/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Hardware Accelerator for the Fast Retrieval of DIALIGN Biological Sequence Alignments in Linear Space","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11260282","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5416685/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hardware Accelerator for the Fast Retrieval of DIALIGN Biological Sequence Alignments in Linear Space","sourcePdf":"ttc2010060808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090514S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5452823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5452823","articleId":"5416685","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5416686,"authors":[{"name":"Mirko Loghi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico Di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5470966/5416686/5416686-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mirko Loghi received the DrEng degree in electrical engineering from the University La Sapienza of Rome and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Verona.

For embedded systems, its benefits can be even pushed further by properly matching the partition to the memory access patterns. When leakage energy comes into play, however, idle memory blocks must be put into a proper low-leakage sleep state to actually save energy when not accessed. In this case, the matching becomes an instance of the power management problem, because moving to and from this sleep state requires additional energy. In this work, we propose an effective solution to the problem of the leakage-aware partitioning of a memory into disjoint subblocks; in particular, we target scratchpad memories, which are commonly used in some embedded systems as a replacement for caches. We show that, although the solution space is extremely large (for a N--block partition, all the combinations of N-1 address boundaries) and nonconvex, it is possible to prove a nontrivial property that considerably reduces the number of partition boundaries to be enumerated, therefore, making exhaustive exploration feasible. We are thus able to provide an optimal solution to the leakage-aware partitioning problem. Experiments on a different sets of embedded applications have shown that total energy savings larger than 60 percent on average can be obtained, with a marginal overhead in execution time, thanks to an effective implementation of the low-leakage sleep state.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11314142","htmlLink":"/document/5416686/","displayDocTitle":"Architectural Leakage Power Minimization of Scratchpad Memories by Application-Driven Subbanking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural Leakage Power Minimization of Scratchpad Memories by Application-Driven Subbanking","sourcePdf":"ttc2010070891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09639S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5470966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5470966","articleId":"5416686","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416693,"authors":[{"name":"Haohuan Fu","affiliation":["Department of Geophysics, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Haohuan","lastName":"Fu","id":"37067708900"},{"name":"Oskar Mencer","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Oskar","lastName":"Mencer","id":"37299218900"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5416693","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":625},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Field programmable gate arrays","Polynomials","Accuracy","Libraries","Estimation","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","logic design","polynomial approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA designs","optimized logarithmic arithmetic","arithmetic library generator","logarithmic number system","floating point designs","general polynomial approximation approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable hardware","special-purpose and application-based systems","computer systems organization","computer arithmetic","general","numerical analysis","mathematics of computing."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416693","abstract":"Using a general polynomial approximation approach, we present an arithmetic library generator for the logarithmic number system (LNS).

Various illustrative styles have been applied to volumetric data sets, producing clearer images and effectively conveying visual information. We adopt particle systems to produce user-configurable stylized renderings from the volume data, imitating traditional pen-and-ink drawings. In the following, we present an interactive GPU-based illustrative volume rendering framework, called VolFliesGPU. In this framework, isosurfaces are sampled by evenly distributed particle sets, delineating surface shape by illustrative styles. The appearance of these styles is based on locally-measured surface properties. For instance, hatches convey surface shape by orientation and shape characteristics are enhanced by color, mapped using a curvature-based transfer function. Hidden-surfaces are generally removed to avoid visual clutter, after that a combination of styles is applied per isosurface. Multiple surfaces and styles can be explored interactively, exploiting parallelism in both graphics hardware and particle systems. We achieve real-time interaction and prompt parametrization of the illustrative styles, using an intuitive GPGPU paradigm that delivers the computational power to drive our particle system and visualization algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5465868/05416701.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5465868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illustrative Volume Visualization Using GPU-Based Particle Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Parallel processing","Graphics","Hardware","Shape","Isosurfaces","Real time systems","Biomedical imaging","Computed tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","data visualisation","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["volume visualization","GPU-based particle systems","volumetric data sets","visual information","user-configurable stylized renderings","traditional pen-and-ink drawings","VolFliesGPU","distributed particle sets","GPU-based illustrative volume rendering framework","curvature-based transfer function","graphics hardware","real time interaction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Volume visualization","illustrative rendering","particle systems","consumer graphics hardware","parallel processing."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Models, Theoretical","Particle Size","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Illustrative Volume Visualization Using GPU-Based Particle Systems","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5416701/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11340804","pubMedId":"20467056","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illustrative Volume Visualization Using GPU-Based Particle Systems","sourcePdf":"ttg2010040571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048768S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2010","isNumber":"5465868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5416701","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5416712,"authors":[{"name":"Huanhuan Chen","affiliation":["The Centre of Excellence of Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications (CERCIA), School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5611455/5416712/5416712-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huanhuan Chen received the BSc degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2004, and the PhD degree, sponsored by Dorothy Hodgkin Postgraduate Award (DHPA), in computer science from the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom, in 2008.

This paper describes NCL in detail and observes that the NCL corresponds to training the entire ensemble as a single learning machine that only minimizes the MSE without regularization. This insight explains that NCL is prone to overfitting the noise in the training set. The paper analyzes this problem and proposes the multiobjective regularized negative correlation learning (MRNCL) algorithm which incorporates an additional regularization term for the ensemble and uses the evolutionary multiobjective algorithm to design ensembles. In MRNCL, we define the crossover and mutation operators and adopt nondominated sorting algorithm with fitness sharing and rank-based fitness assignment. The experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world data sets demonstrate that MRNCL achieves better performance than NCL, especially when the noise level is nontrivial in the data set. In the experimental discussion, we give three reasons why our algorithm outperforms others.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.26","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5611455/05416712.pdf","startPage":"1738","endPage":"1751","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Neural Network Ensembles Based on Regularized Negative Correlation Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Neural Network Ensembles Based on Regularized Negative Correlation Learning","volume":"22","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11615834","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5416712/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Neural Network Ensembles Based on Regularized Negative Correlation Learning","sourcePdf":"ttk2010121738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103921S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5611455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5611455","articleId":"5416712","onlineDate":"18 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5416750,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Sigg","affiliation":["Institute of Operation systems and computer networks, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Sigg","id":"37295553200"},{"name":"Rayan Merched El Masri","affiliation":["Institute of Operation systems and computer networks, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Rayan Merched El","lastName":"Masri","id":"37408119700"},{"name":"Julian Ristau","affiliation":["Institute of Operation systems and computer networks, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Ristau","id":"37402371800"},{"name":"Michael Beigl","affiliation":["Institute of Operation systems and computer networks, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Beigl","id":"37272367300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3517-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3518-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5416750","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Feedback","Array signal processing","Wireless sensor networks","Frequency synchronization","Energy consumption","RF signals","MIMO","Costs","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","software radio","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop feedback","distributed adaptive transmit beamforming","wireless sensor networks","WSN","phase synchronisation","distributed adaptive transmit beam-forming","USRP software radios"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations, performance and instrumentation of closed-loop feedback based distributed adaptive transmit beamforming in WSNs","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416740","endPage":"456","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406658/5416740/05416750.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416750","startPage":"451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416750","abstract":"We study closed-loop feedback based approaches to distributed adaptive transmit beamforming in wireless sensor networks.

The chipless transponders have unique spectral signatures which correspond to resonances present at different frequencies in the spectrum. Each resonance has a 1:1 correspondence with a data bit. The chipless RFID reader detects the resonances as attenuation in the magnitude and phase-jumps in the phase of the spectrum. The RFID reader operates between 1.9 and 2.5 GHz and can successfully detect a transponder at close range. The tag design can be transferred easily to plastic and paper, making it suitable for mass deployment for low cost items in trillions.

In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks, which reduces the amount of data that needs to be communicated through the network. Our approach learns an ellipsoidal boundary for normal data at each sensor, and introduces a method to cluster these ellipsoids at a global level in order to model normal behaviour in the network. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve greater accuracy in non-homogeneous sensing environments than existing methods, while achieving low communication and computational overhead in the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406658/5416740/05416818.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection by clustering ellipsoids in wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ellipsoids","Wireless sensor networks","Pollution measurement","Monitoring","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Event detection","Costs","Base stations","Computer science","Software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","clustering ellipsoids","wireless sensor networks","distributed algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection by clustering ellipsoids in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5416818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141174","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection by clustering ellipsoids in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"7299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070571S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5406658","isNumber":"5416740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5406658","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5416740","articleId":"5416818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5416847,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Sigg","affiliation":["Institute of Operation systems and computer networks, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Sigg","id":"37295553200"},{"name":"Michael Beigl","affiliation":["Institute of Operation systems and computer networks, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Beigl","id":"37272367300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3517-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3518-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5416847","dbTime":"43 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5416847","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Array signal processing","Wireless sensor networks","Frequency synchronization","MIMO","Energy consumption","Directive antennas","Transmitting antennas","Signal processing","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","synchronisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop feedback","distributed adaptive beamforming","wireless sensor networks","distributed adaptive transmit beamforming","carrier signals phase synchronisation","phase alteration probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416847","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5406658/5416740/05416847.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for closed-loop feedback based distributed adaptive beamforming in wireless sensor networks","abstract":"We study a closed-loop feedback based approach to distributed adaptive transmit beamforming in wireless sensor networks.

The performance of neural network based rainfall estimation is subject to many factors such as the representativeness and sufficiency of the training dataset, the generalization capability of the network to new data, seasonal changes, and regional changes. Improving the performance of the neural network in real time context is of great interest. In this paper, the goal is to improve rainfall estimation based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks. The principal components analysis (PCA) technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of the training dataset. Reducing the dimensionality of the input training data will reduce the training time as well as reduce the network complexity. More importantly, the small scale uncertainty will be removed during PCA such that the network is less likely overfitted. In addition, \u00bfRain/No Rain\u00bf detection is performed using an adaptive neural network running simultaneously with the rainfall estimation neural network. The \u00bfRain/No Rain\u00bf detection can eliminate those \u00bfNo Rain\u00bf data inputs from the training set.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5416888","startPage":"I-200","endPage":"I-203","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5416888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416731","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5416731/05416888.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving rainfall estimation from ground based radar measurements using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5416888/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving rainfall estimation from ground based radar measurements using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5416888/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11220472","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving rainfall estimation from ground based radar measurements using neural networks","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0100200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048215S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5416731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5416731","articleId":"5416888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5416941,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Since all known constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) adaptive detectors such as the traditional generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT), adaptive matched filter (AMF), and adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) detectors use the generic maximum-likelihood (ML) sample covariance matrix estimate (CME), the sample support necessary for accurate detection must significantly exceed the adaptive system (e.g., antenna array) dimension M, and so is often impractically large. For scenarios with a limited number m of dominant covariance matrix eigenvalues, more efficient diagonally loaded CMEs are available, whose required sample support is comparable to m (rather than M) for efficient interference mitigation. Since detectors that adopt these and other CMEs that use some a~priori information are not strictly CFAR, here we consider a \"two-stage\" adaptive detection scheme that optimally partitions the total sample support T into two sets: T_CME data samples are used to design the adaptive filter (beamformer), and the remaining T_CFAR samples are used to calculate the adaptive scalar false-alarm threshold. We present a comparative analysis of the detection performance of \"one-stage\" CFAR and \"two-stage\" adaptive detectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5417146/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11138105","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sample-Deficient Adaptive Detection: Adaptive Scalar Thresholding versus CFAR Detector Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample-Deficient Adaptive Detection: Adaptive Scalar Thresholding versus CFAR Detector Performance","sourcePdf":"46aes01-Abramovich1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090866S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5417139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5417139","articleId":"5417146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5417150,"authors":[{"name":"X.

There has been theoretical and experimental evaluation on the performance of CFDP operation in low Earth orbit (LEO) and geo-stationary Earth orbit (GEO) space environments. However, very few works have evaluated the performance of CFDP in cislunar space, even though the protocol has been particularly developed for deep space communications. In this work we discuss an experimental investigation of the core file-delivery operation of unreliable CFDP, operating with reliable transmission control protocol (TCP), over a simulated cislunar communication link under various channel conditions. Our intention is to evaluate the transmission effectiveness of the core file-delivery operation in unreliable CFDP running on top of a reliable TCP/IP stack over a long-delayed cislunar link, especially when accompanied by link disruptions and a high bit error rate (BER). The performance of unreliable-CFDP/TCP is also compared with other protocol options of CFDP, such as reliable-CFDP/TCP and reliable-CFDP/UDP. The experiment was carried out through realistic file transfers by running the CFDP protocol stack over a communication test-bed incorporating the qualities that define cislunar communication channel characteristics. The research results and discussions presented in this paper should work equally well in any space mission with a round-trip time (RTT) that is comparable to that of the cislunar space.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","volume":"46","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11138112","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5417153/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unreliable CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) over Cislunar Communication Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unreliable CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) over Cislunar Communication Links","sourcePdf":"46aes01-Wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145645S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5417139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5417139","articleId":"5417153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5417154,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Although the statistical performance of this estimation technique has been extensively investigated, it has never been analyzed from the viewpoint of the joint detection-estimation problem. As a consequence the historical form of the (detector-angle estimator) solution has become the usual form implemented in operational tracking systems and may restrict their accessible performance. Indeed, the application of the optimal detection theory reveals alternative (detector-angle estimator) solutions providing other relevant trade-offs in detection-estimation performances that are worth considering to optimize the performance of the tracking system according to the scenario. Both stochastic signal model (Rayleigh-type signal source) and deterministic signal model (signal source of unknown amplitude) have been investigated, leading to a novel but equally simple (detector-angle estimator) solution through which analytical statistical prediction has been derived. Comparison of detection-estimation performances of new and usual solutions is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11138128","volume":"46","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5417170/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Detection Estimation Problem of Monopulse Angle Measurement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Detection Estimation Problem of Monopulse Angle Measurement","sourcePdf":"46aes01-Galy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073124S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5417139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5417139","articleId":"5417170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5417172,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Yardibi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5417139/5417172/5417172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tarik Yardibi (S'08) received his B.S. degree from Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey in 2004 and his M.S. degree from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey in 2006, both in electrical engineering.","He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the Spectral Analysis Laboratory at the University of Florida, Gainesville.

In the absence of a large number of snapshots, which is the case in numerous practical applications, such as underwater array processing, it becomes challenging to estimate the source parameters accurately. This paper presents a nonparametric and hyperparameter, free-weighted, least squares-based iterative adaptive approach for amplitude and phase estimation (IAA-APES) in array processing. IAA-APES can work well with few snapshots (even one), uncorrelated, partially correlated, and coherent sources, and arbitrary array geometries. IAA-APES is extended to give sparse results via a model-order selection tool, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Moreover, it is shown that further improvements in resolution and accuracy can be achieved by applying the parametric relaxation-based cyclic approach (RELAX) to refine the IAA-APES&BIC estimates if desired. IAA-APES can also be applied to active sensing applications, including single-input single-output (SISO) radar/sonar range-Doppler imaging and multi-input single-output (MISO) channel estimation for communications. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of IAA-APES for all of these applications, and IAA-APES is shown to outperform a number of existing approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5417139/05417172.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2010.5417172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2010.5417172","startPage":"425","endPage":"443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source Localization and Sensing: A Nonparametric Iterative Adaptive Approach Based on Weighted Least Squares","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417172/","displayDocTitle":"Source Localization and Sensing: A Nonparametric Iterative Adaptive Approach Based on Weighted Least Squares","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5417172/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11138130","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source Localization and Sensing: A Nonparametric Iterative Adaptive Approach Based on Weighted Least Squares","sourcePdf":"46aes01-Yardibi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140283S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5417139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"337","xplore-issue":"5417139","articleId":"5417172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5417173,"authors":[{"name":"Kainam Thomas Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic & Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kainam Thomas","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278684000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"5417173","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":551},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Frequency","Underwater acoustics","Acoustic waves","Direction of arrival estimation","Navigation","Interference","Wideband","Spread spectrum communication","Acoustic sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","blind source separation","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic vector sensor","FFH","fast frequency-hop","blind beamforming","geolocation","acoustic direction-finding","blind interference rejection algorithm","noncooperative wideband","spread spectrum signals","unknown hop sequences","unknown arrival angles","beamforming weights","frequency variations","frequency-hopping signals","acoustic vector-sensor","vector-hydrophone","acoustic velocity-sensors","optional collocated pressure-sensor","spatial collocation","component sensors"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic Vector-Sensor FFH \"Blind\" Beamforming & Geolocation","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2010.5417173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417139","endPage":"448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5417139/05417173.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2010.5417173","startPage":"444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417173","abstract":"An acoustic direction-finding and blind interference rejection algorithm for up to three noncooperative wideband, fast frequency-hop (FFH) spread spectrum signals of unknown hop sequences and unknown arrival angles is presented.

The design study is based on the coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method (CPCFEM), previously presented by Dr. Zhu. This model can calculate the power output of piezoelectric EHDS directly connected to a load resistor and is used in this paper to obtain the following simulation results for variations in geometric parameters such as the beam length, width and thickness, and the mass length, width, and height: 1) the current flowing through and the voltage developed across the load resistor, 2) the power dissipated by the resistor and the corresponding vibrational displacement amplitude, and 3) the resonant frequency. By studying these results, straightforward design strategies that enable the generation of more power are obtained for each geometric parameter, and a physical understanding of how each parameter affects the output power is given. It is suggested that, in designing with the aim of generating more power, the following strategies be used: 1) for the beam, a shorter length, larger width, and lower ratio of piezoelectric layer thickness to total beam thickness are preferred in the case of a fixed mass; 2) for the mass, a shortened mass length and a higher mass height are preferred in the case of variation in the mass length and the mass height with mass width and mass value remain fixed, and a wider width and small mass height are preferred in the case of variation in mass width and height (mass length and value remain fixed; and 3) for the case of a fixed total length, a shorter beam length and longer mass length are preferred. With the design strategies, output powers from the device can reach above 1 to 2 mW/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n, much higher than the 200 ?W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n currently achieved in the published literature. This is an encouraging prospect for enabling a wider range of applications of the EHDs. In addition, physical insights into how each parameter influences output power are also discussed in detail.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5417179/05417202.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design study of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices for generation of higher electrical power using a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Piezoelectric devices","Power generation","Finite element methods","Resistors","Solid modeling","Voltage","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","finite element analysis","piezoelectric devices","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices","coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method","vibration energy sources","load resistor","vibrational displacement amplitude","resonant frequency","piezoelectric layer thickness","beam thickness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design study of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices for generation of higher electrical power using a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method","volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5417202/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11138220","pubMedId":"20178909","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design study of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices for generation of higher electrical power using a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method","sourcePdf":"t1020427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134129S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5417179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5417179","articleId":"5417202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5417205,"authors":[{"name":"Paul L.

A new imaging technique dubbed \"super-harmonic imaging\" (SHI) was recently proposed. It takes advantage of the higher-third to fifth-harmonics arising from nonlinear propagation or ultrasound-contrast-agent (UCA) response. Next to its better suppression of near-field artifacts, tissue SHI is expected to improve axial and lateral resolutions resulting in clearer images than second-harmonic imaging. When SHI is used in combination with UCAs, a better contrast-to-tissue ratio can be obtained. The use of SHI implies a large dynamic range and requires a sufficiently sensitive array over a frequency range from the transmission frequency up to its fifth harmonic (bandwidth > 130%). In this paper, we present the characteristics and performance of a new interleaved dual frequency array built chiefly for SHI. We report the rationale behind the design choice, frequencies, aperture, and piezomaterials used. The array is efficient both in transmission and reception with well-behaved transfer functions and a combined -6-dB bandwidth of 144%. In addition, there is virtually no contamination of the harmonic components by spurious transducer transmission, due to low element-to-element crosstalk (< 30 dB) and a low transmission efficiency of the odd harmonics (< 46 dB). The interleaved array presented in this article possesses ideal characteristics for SHI and is suitable for other methods like second-harmonic, subharmonic, and second-order ultrasound field (SURF) imaging.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5417179/05417205.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-harmonic imaging: development of an interleaved phased-array transducer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417205/","displayDocTitle":"Super-harmonic imaging: development of an interleaved phased-array transducer","volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2010","accessionNumber":"11138223","pubMedId":"20178912","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5417205/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-harmonic imaging: development of an interleaved phased-array transducer","sourcePdf":"t1020455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094513S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5417179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5417179","articleId":"5417205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5417206,"authors":[{"name":"Marco A.

Its wetland ecosystem has a significant impact on China's environment change. In this paper, we discuss the neural network algorithms (NNA) to retrieve wetland vegetation biomass using the alternating polarization Envisat ASAR data. Two field measurements were carried out coincident with the satellite overpasses at this area through the hydrological cycle from April and November. Training data of the neural network are generated by the Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS) model which is often used for the tree canopy. We modified the model to make it applicable to herbaceous wetland ecosystems. The model input parameters are defined according to the wetland circumstance. NNA retrieval results are validated with ground measured data. The inversion results show the NNA combined with MIMICS model is capable of performing the retrieval with good accuracy. Finally, the trained neural network is used to estimate the overall biomass of Poyang Lake wetland vegetation.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417344","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417310/05417344.pdf","startPage":"IV-180","endPage":"IV-183","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network algorithm and backscattering model for biomass estimation of wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake area using Envisat ASAR data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural network algorithm and backscattering model for biomass estimation of wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake area using Envisat ASAR data","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11246209","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5417344/","conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network algorithm and backscattering model for biomass estimation of wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake area using Envisat ASAR data","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0400180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037256S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5417310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","xplore-issue":"5417310","articleId":"5417344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5417363,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In recent years ICA has been largely studied by researchers from the signal processing community. This paper addresses a more in-depth study on the use of this method, applied to hyper-spectral images used for remote sensing purposes. In a first part, source separation is addressed. Since the independence of sources is usually not verified in hyperspectral real data images, ICA, if used alone, is not a suitable tool to unmix sources. We propose a hierarchical approximation for the use of ICA as a pre-processing step for a Bayesian Positive Source Separation method. In a second part, the use of ICA for dimensionality reduction is studied in the frame of hyperspectral data classification.

The goal is to provide robustness to the algorithm proposed in [1], with respect to the presence of outliers in the analysis window. In [1], data from 4 \u00bfm and 11 \u00bfm MODIS bands, that are statistically correlated, are re-projected through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain uncorrelated data, a necessary condition for the final stage of CFAR detection. Unfortunately, the sample covariance matrix used in the PCA can be strongly affected by the presence of thermal anomalies, therefore a robust estimator is needed. To this aim, the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator (MCD) is introduced in the PCA yielding an analysis that is little influenced by the presence of anomalies while provides results similar to the usual PCA for uncontaminated data. Experimental results have shown that many detections can be missed if the MCD estimator is not used in the presence of anomalies, even if their number is not so high but their values are able to modify significantly the sample covariance matrix. The robust multiband CFAR algorithm has been applied to a MODIS image and results have been compared with those from NASA-DAAC MOD14.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417371","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417310/05417371.pdf","startPage":"IV-65","endPage":"IV-68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust multiband detection of thermal anomalies using the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417371/","displayDocTitle":"Robust multiband detection of thermal anomalies using the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"11246236","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5417371/","conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust multiband detection of thermal anomalies using the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0400065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072195S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5417310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5417310","articleId":"5417371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5417413,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes R.

The speckle degrades the quality of the images and makes interpretation, analysis and classification of SAR images harder. Therefore, some speckle reduction is necessary prior to the processing of SAR images. The speckle noise can be modeled as multiplicative i.i.d. Rayleigh noise. Sveinsson and Benediktsson [1996], proposed an adaptive sigmoid thresholding method for SAR images in the wavelet domain. The coefficients thresholding for this method is based on the choice of parameters in the sigmoid thresholding function. They were chosen according to a visual appreciation, i.e., by an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ad hoc</i>\n method. We propose to select these parameters by minimizing an estimate of square error between the clean image and the denoised one. The key point is that we have in our proposal computable, statistically unbiased, MSE estimate - Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) - that depends on the noisy image alone, not on the clean image.

Our approach combines techniques used in multispectral and hyperspectral anomaly detection with a Kalman-Filter (KF) for tracking. The algorithm takes advantage of the additional information provided by the spectra in multispectral and hyperspectral sequences and combines it with a KF to track a target in the presence of occlusions. The proposed algorithm is based on modeling the tracked object's local background with the help of a Self Organizing Map (SOM), followed by the construction of a 2D Centre of Gravity Map (CoGM), the entries of which lead to the localisation of the target's current position. The KF, in prediction mode, is employed in order to perform robust tracking during occlusion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417310/05417486.pdf","startPage":"IV-753","endPage":"IV-759","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of Kalman Filter and anomaly detection for multispectral and hyperspectral target tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Hyperspectral sensors","Hyperspectral imaging","Gravity","Robustness","Optical filters","Optical noise","Optical sensors","Object detection","Motion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","hidden feature removal","Kalman filters","remote sensing","self-organising feature maps","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman Filter","anomaly detection","multispectral target tracking","hyperspectral target tracking","Self Organizing Map","2D Centre of Gravity Map","occlusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of Kalman Filter and anomaly detection for multispectral and hyperspectral target tracking","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5417486/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"11246377","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of Kalman Filter and anomaly detection for multispectral and hyperspectral target tracking","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0400753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054424S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5417310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5417310","articleId":"5417486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5417514,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandra Budillon","affiliation":["Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli \"Parthenope\", Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Budillon","id":"37283845200"},{"name":"Annarita Evangelista","affiliation":["DAEIIMI, Universit\u00e1 di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Annarita","lastName":"Evangelista","id":"37400049400"},{"name":"Gilda Schirinzi","affiliation":["Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli \"Parthenope\", Italy"],"firstName":"Gilda","lastName":"Schirinzi","id":"37284811000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3395-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"5417514","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":825},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Focusing","Synthetic aperture radar","Orbits","Layout","Reflectivity","Azimuth","Image coding","Image sampling","Radar scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","radar imaging","remote sensing by radar","sampling methods","synthetic aperture radar","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR tomography","sparse samples","synthetic aperture radar","3D SAR image formation","scene reflectivity estimation","azimuth coordinate","range coordinate","elevation coordinate","3D image focusing","compressive sampling theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Aperture Radar","3-D radar imaging","SAR tomography"]}],"abstract":"Three dimensional (3-D) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image formation provides the scene reflectivity estimation along azimuth, range and elevation co-ordinates.

Numerical result on real data has provided the evidence for great potential of CS-STAP as a effective approach when clutter is non-stationary because it need much less training data compared with common STAP methods.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417664","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417612/05417664.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417664","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","startPage":"V-336","endPage":"V-339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel STAP algorithm using sparse recovery technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel STAP algorithm using sparse recovery technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417664/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5417664/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"11275393","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel STAP algorithm using sparse recovery technique","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0500336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093918S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5417612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5417612","articleId":"5417664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5417693,"authors":[{"name":"Guoxia Yu","affiliation":["Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Guoxia","lastName":"Yu","id":"37399256000"},{"name":"Tanya Vladimirova","affiliation":["Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Tanya","lastName":"Vladimirova","id":"37300553600"},{"name":"Martin N.

selection for hyperspectral images based on parallel particle swarm optimization schemes","abstract":"Greedy modular eigenspaces (GME) has been developed for the band selection of hyperspectral images (HSI). GME attempts to greedily select uncorrelated feature sets from HSI. Unfortunately, GME is hard to find the optimal set by greedy operations except by exhaustive iterations. The long execution time has been the major drawback in practice. Accordingly, finding an optimal (or near-optimal) solution is very expensive. In this study we present a novel parallel mechanism, referred to as parallel particle swarm optimization (PPSO) band selection, to overcome this disadvantage. It makes use of a new particle swarm optimization scheme, a well-known method to solve the optimization problems, to develop an effective parallel feature extraction for HSI. The proposed PPSO improves the computational speed by using parallel computing techniques which include the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) of graphics processor unit (GPU), the message passing interface (MPI) and the open multi-processing (OpenMP) applications. These parallel implementations can fully utilize the significant parallelism of proposed PPSO to create a set of near-optimal GME modules on each parallel node. The experimental results demonstrated that PPSO can significantly improve the computational loads and provide a more reliable quality of solution compared to GME. The effectiveness of the proposed PPSO is evaluated by MODIS/ASTER airborne simulator (MASTER) HSI for band selection during the Pacrim II campaign.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"11275361","htmlLink":"/document/5417728/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Band selection for hyperspectral images based on parallel particle swarm optimization schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Band selection for hyperspectral images based on parallel particle swarm optimization schemes","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0500084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067205S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5417612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5417612","articleId":"5417728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5417783,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Del Frate","affiliation":["Tor Vergata Earth Observation Lab-Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Del Frate","id":"37269662900"},{"name":"Giorgio Licciardi","affiliation":["Tor Vergata Earth Observation Lab-Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Licciardi","id":"38511793100"},{"name":"Fabio Pacifici","affiliation":["Tor Vergata Earth Observation Lab-Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pacifici","id":"37312017600"},{"name":"Chiara Pratola","affiliation":["Tor Vergata Earth Observation Lab-Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Pratola","id":"38505129800"},{"name":"Domenico Solimini","affiliation":["Tor Vergata Earth Observation Lab-Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Solimini","id":"37299465400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3395-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"5417783","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417783","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feature extraction","Testing","Image resolution","Image recognition","Urban areas","Satellites","Optical pulses","Brain modeling","Image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","neural nets","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pulse Coupled Neural Network","automatic features extraction","COSMO-Skymed imagery","TerraSAR-X imagery","visual cortex"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN)","COSMO-Skymed","TerraSAR-X","features extraction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417783","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417750/05417783.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","startPage":"III-384","endPage":"III-387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse Coupled Neural Network for automatic features extraction from COSMO-Skymed and TerraSAR-X imagery","abstract":"In this paper we test an unsupervised neural network approach for extracting features from very high resolution X-band SAR images.

Since then, it is continuously providing high resolution space-borne radar data which are perfectly suitable for sophisticated interferometric applications. I.e. the mission concept and the SAR sensor support the coherent stacking of radar scenes which is the basis for advanced processing techniques e.g. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and SAR tomography. In particular, the short repeat cycle of eleven days and the highly reproducible scene repetition of the spotlight acquisitions support the stacking and consequently the time series analysis of the radar data. Furthermore, the sensor's orbital tube is precisely controlled to be in the order of 200 m which basically allows to utilize the baseline spread of the stacked acquisitions. However, this small spread is actually limiting the resolution in the SAR tomography. Interferometric applications could be demonstrated already in a very early stage of the TerraSAR-X mission. Because the resolution is 0.6 m in slant range and 1.1 m in azimuth in the high resolution spotlight mode the PSI and the SAR tomography processing results were impressive. Urban areas and single buildings could be mapped from space in three dimensions. Even the structural stress of single buildings caused by thermal dilation could be demonstrated. However, extended layover areas are caused by typical buildings and as a consequence complicated scattering situations need to be resolved. DLR's operational In-SAR processing system GENESIS had already been adapted to cope with the new sensor modes of TerraSAR-X and their new specific spectral characteristics. Now, the new image characteristics e.g. the extended layover areas and the long time coherent distributed scatterer need better to be supported. Subject is to optimally exploit the available information e.g. the radar reflectivity. Several algorithms of the processing system can take advantage of this, e.g. the scatterer configuration detection. As a matter of fact, the scatterer configuration has now become a very important characteristic for each resolution cell. It influences e.g. the estimation data extraction, the estimation of the 3D location and basically the estimation precision. A typical resolution cell can be composed of a single dominant point scatterer surrounded by clutter, two or more dominant point scatterers in clutter and of distributed scatterers with a specific phase stability over time. The paper provides technical details and a processing example of a newly developed algorithm to retrieve the 3D location of point scatterers from the scene's intensity which finally also provides the information on the scatterer configuration in a resolution cell.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417917","startPage":"III-900","endPage":"III-903","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417750/05417917.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques and examples for the 3D reconstruction of complex scattering situations using TerraSAR-X","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Techniques and examples for the 3D reconstruction of complex scattering situations using TerraSAR-X","conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5417917/","accessionNumber":"11150009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417917/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques and examples for the 3D reconstruction of complex scattering situations using TerraSAR-X","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0300900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04349S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5417750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5417750","articleId":"5417917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5417945,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["Universita' di Napoli \"Federico II\", Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"De Maio","id":"37272858900"},{"name":"Gianfranco Fornaro","affiliation":["Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dell''Ambiente, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianfranco","lastName":"Fornaro","id":"37269290500"},{"name":"Antonio Pauciullo","affiliation":["Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dell''Ambiente, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Pauciullo","id":"37400220200"},{"name":"Diego Reale","affiliation":["Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dell''Ambiente, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Reale","id":"37400224100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3395-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"5417945","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Radar scattering","Interferometry","Radar polarimetry","Testing","Synthetic aperture radar","IEEE members","Multidimensional systems","Pixel","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","synthetic aperture radar","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double scatterers","SAR tomography","multi-dimensional SAR imaging","ground scatterers","azimuth-range pixel","high resolution radar systems","differential tomography","scatterers detection","Bayesian Information Criterion","Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-Dimensional SAR imaging","Differential Tomography","Scatterers Detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417945","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417750","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417750/05417945.pdf","startPage":"III-172","endPage":"III-175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of double scatterers in SAR Tomography","abstract":"Multi-Dimensional (3D/4D) SAR imaging (SAR Tomography and Differential SAR Tomography) allows the localization and monitoring of ground scatterers, even interfering in the same azimuth-range pixel.

In CSSM, the sub-pixel mapping problem becomes one of assigning land cover classes to the sub-pixels while maximizing the spatial dependence by clonal selection algorithm. CSSM inherits the biologic properties of human immune systems, i.e. clone, mutation, memory, to build a memory-cell population with a diverse set of local optimal solutions. Based on the memory-cell population, CSSM outputs the value of the memory cell and find the optimal sub-pixel mapping result. The proposed method was tested using the synthetic and degraded real imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperform traditional sub-pixel mapping algorithms, and hence provide an effective option for sub-pixel mapping of remote sensing imagery.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on artificial immune systems for remote sensing imagery","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417948","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417750/05417948.pdf","startPage":"III-1007","endPage":"III-1010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417750","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5417948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on artificial immune systems for remote sensing imagery","conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5417948/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"11150040","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on artificial immune systems for remote sensing imagery","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0301007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068388S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5417750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5417750","articleId":"5417948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5417998,"authors":[{"name":"Veraldo Liesenberg","affiliation":["Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, Freiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Veraldo","lastName":"Liesenberg","id":"37400928900"},{"name":"Hans-Dieter Viktor Boehm","affiliation":["Kalteng Consultans, Kirchstockacher Weg 2, 85635, Hoehenkirchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Dieter Viktor","lastName":"Boehm","id":"37409293500"},{"name":"Richard Gloaguen","affiliation":["Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, Freiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Gloaguen","id":"37395362000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3395-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"5417998","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflectivity","Pixel","Ocean temperature","Geometry","Vegetation mapping","High-resolution imaging","Spectroscopy","Layout","Rivers","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reflectivity","terrain mapping","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CHRIS data","Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer","AD 2004 18","South Borneo","Central Kalimantan","Indonesia","spectral bands","reflectance","leaf area index","multi-angular approach","classification overall accuracy","multi-angular data","view angle effects","land cover","Peat Swamp Forest","PROBA data","tropical peat swamp landscape","Kappa statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CHRIS/PROBA","Peat Swamp Forest","Forest Succession","land cover","view angle effects"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417998","abstract":"In this study we examine the classification accuracy of a CHRIS (Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) data, acquired on May 18, 2004 (monsoon).

We show that (1) the reflectance increases accordingly to the successional stages for a given angle and (2) that reflectance values increase in the near-infrared with decreasing leaf area index (LAI). From the single (nadir) to the multi-angular approach, classification overall accuracy increased from 77.1% to 90.4%.

These two angles are also described, respectively, as incident and reflected angles. The geometry-dependence of surface reflectance is usually corrected by a tailored Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). It is the most common tool used to eliminate or to reduce the effects of sun-sensor geometry on the reflected radiation. Generally, BRDFs are derived empirically (or semi-empirically) for a specific land cover by analyzing a large set of observations (training set) made under different illumination and observation angles. This approach involves fitting the model to collected observations and inverting it. A strong BRDF model tailored to specific land cover characteristics of the UAE is especially needed for applications that use data acquired with variable sun-sensor geometry. In this paper, a neural-network-based tool \"BRDF\" was developed and applied to quantify the effect of sun illumination and SEVIRI-MSG observation angles on measured reflectance for both land (mostly desert) and coastal water pixels in the UAE.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sea measurements","Lighting","Sun","Reflectivity","Geometry","Satellites","Bidirectional control","Distribution functions","Solid modeling","Goniometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric radiation","geophysical techniques","neural nets","reflectivity","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network-based BRDF tool","UAE","coastal zones","inland zones","reflected radiation","sun illumination","satellite observation angles","surface reflectance","bidirectional reflectance distribution function","sun-sensor geometry","SEVIRI-MSG observation angles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)","METEOSAT Second Generation (MSG)","SEVIRI-MSG","Neural Networks","UAE"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5418116","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5403226/5417981/05418116.pdf","startPage":"II-460","endPage":"II-463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5417981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5418116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing a neural-network-based \u201cBRDF\u201d tool for the UAE coastal and inland zones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Developing a neural-network-based \u201cBRDF\u201d tool for the UAE coastal and inland zones","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418116/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5418116/","accessionNumber":"11150300","conferenceDate":"12-17 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing a neural-network-based \u201cBRDF\u201d tool for the UAE coastal and inland zones","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"0200460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039396S","chronDate":"12-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5403226","isNumber":"5417981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5403226","xplore-issue":"5417981","articleId":"5418116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5418159,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Maeda","affiliation":["EORC, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Maeda","id":"37399754300"},{"name":"Tadashi Takano","affiliation":["Nihon University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Takano","id":"37273823700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3395-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"5418159","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Earthquakes","Microwave radiometry","Brightness temperature","Microwave generation","Frequency","Signal generators","Land surface","Polarization","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformation","earthquakes","failure (mechanical)","geophysical signal processing","radiometers","radiometry","remote sensing","rocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave signal detection","earthquake rock failure","satellite borne microwave radiometer data","rock compression microwave emission","land surface deformation","land surface rock failure microwave energy","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer","Earth Observation System","Sichuan","China","AD 2008 05 12"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave radiometer","Earthquake detection","Data processing","Natural disaster monitoring"]}],"abstract":"It was experimentally confirmed that microwave is emitted during the compression of rocks.

In particular, we deal with the well-known strategy of navigating by \u00bfwall-following\u00bf. For this purpose, four standard neural architectures (Logistic Perceptron, Multilayer Percep-tron, Mixture of Experts and Elman network) are used to associate different spatiotemporal sensory input patterns with four predetermined action categories. All stages of the experiments-data acquisition, selection and training of the architectures in a simulator and their execution on a real mobile robot-are described. The obtained results suggest that the wall-following task, formulated as a pattern classification problem, is nonlinearly separable, a result that favors the MLP network if no memory of input patters are taken into account. If short-term memory mechanisms are used, then even a linear network is able to perform the same task successfully.","doi":"10.1109/LARS.2009.5418323","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th Latin American Robotics Symposium (LARS 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412668/5418313/05418323.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 6th Latin American Robotics Symposium (LARS 2009)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LARS.2009.5418323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term memory mechanisms in neural network learning of robot navigation tasks: A case study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Navigation","Logistics","Neurons","Multilayer perceptrons","Educational robots","Robot sensing systems","Mobile robots","Educational technology","Paper technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","motion control","multilayer perceptrons","navigation","pattern classification","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term memory mechanisms","neural network learning","robot navigation","neural classifiers","wall-following navigation","logistic perceptron","multilayer perceptron","Elman network","spatiotemporal sensory input patterns","mobile robot","pattern classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Short-term memory mechanisms in neural network learning of robot navigation tasks: A case study","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5418323/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","conferenceDate":"29-30 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11141444","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term memory mechanisms in neural network learning of robot navigation tasks: A case study","confLoc":"Valparaiso, Chile","sourcePdf":"PID1084457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045215S","chronDate":"29-30 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412668","isNumber":"5418313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412668","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5418313","articleId":"5418323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5418384,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Kyu Jeong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Kyu","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37399526100"},{"name":"Ki-Heung Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Heung","lastName":"Park","id":"37293452100"},{"name":"Hyuck-In Kwon","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyuck-In","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37400517900"},{"name":"Sung-Ho Kong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Ho","lastName":"Kong","id":"37404121800"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280320100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2071-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4636"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4644"}],"articleNumber":"5418384","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluctuations","Doping","Transistors","Niobium","Computer science","Random access memory","Threshold voltage","SONOS devices","Size control","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical double-gate structure","nonvolatile charge storage node","1T-DRAM cell device","vertical channel double-gate 1T-DRAM cell transistor","sensing margin","retention characteristic","programming charge","peak body doping"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel vertical channel double-gate 1T-DRAM cell transistor with nonvolatile charge storage node was proposed.

Static random access memory (SRAM) scaling, which requires increasing design margins despite decreasing layout area, may motivate the transition to a multi-gate architecture. Tri-gate bulk devices are an attractive multi-gate option because of their high compatibility with existing circuit designs and processes. In this work. SRAM cell simulations are used to quantify the expected yield improvements and design tradeoffs with tri-gate devices.

To confirm the memory operation of the SGVC cell, we simulated and characterized memory effects such as sensing margin and retention time. According to these results, the SGVC cell can operate as an embedded 1T DRAM having a sufficiently large sensing margin and retention time.

The per-pixel readout circuit consists in a digital pixel sensor array constituted by a photodiode and a one-bit first-order sigma-delta analog to digital converter for each pixel. The output of each pixel is a digital bit stream, containing information about the intensity of the light that falls into its photodiode. The sigma-delta A/D converters use only ten small size MOSFETs and one capacitor. The comparison between the solution presented here and other solutions show that the circuit complexity is similar but the performance, in terms of signal to noise ratio, is superior.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412667/5418573/05418577.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2009.5418577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2009.5418577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sigma-delta A/D converter for CMOS image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","Image converters","CMOS image sensors","Sensor arrays","Circuits","Photodiodes","Matrix converters","Analog-digital conversion","Streaming media","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","readout electronics","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sigma-delta A/D converter","CMOS image sensors","per-pixel readout circuit","imaging matrix","photodiode","MOSFET"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image sensors","Sigma-delta modulation","Smart pixels","Photodiodes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sigma-delta A/D converter for CMOS image sensors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5418577/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151406","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sigma-delta A/D converter for CMOS image sensors","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"p94silva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.161778S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412667","isNumber":"5418573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412667","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5418573","articleId":"5418577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5418580,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Shaterian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering K N, Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Shaterian","id":"37062826900"},{"name":"Adib Abrishamifar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Adib","lastName":"Abrishamifar","id":"37297887900"},{"name":"Hossein Shamsi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering K N, Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Shamsi","id":"37294942700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5816-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5814-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5815-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"5418580","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":608},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418580","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Dynamic range","Piecewise linear approximation","Operational amplifiers","Paper technology","Mathematical analysis","Radar applications","Programmable logic arrays","Piecewise linear techniques","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","radio receivers","radiofrequency amplifiers","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable true piecewise approximation logarithmic amplifier","operation theory","mathematical analysis","parallel summation type","wide range wireless receivers","radar applications","analog signal processing applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["True Piecewise Approximation Logarithmic Amplifier","Parallel Summation Logarithmic Amplifier","Programmable Logarithmic Amplifier (PLA)","Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA)"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the operation theory, mathematical analysis and simulation of parallel summation type of the true piecewise approximation logarithmic amplifiers.

We show that the proposed transform is orthogonal, which is a highly desirable property. In order to make this novel transform more attractive for recent real-time applications, we develop an efficient algorithm for its fast computation. By using this algorithm, the proposed transform requires only 18 additions to transform an 8-point sequence. Compared to the existing 8\u00d78 approximated DCT matrices, it is shown that savings of 25% in the number of arithmetic operations can easily be achieved using the proposed transform operator without noticeable degradations in the reconstructed images. We also present simulation results using some standard test images to show the efficiency of the proposed transform in image compression.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418584","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compression","DCT matrix","discrete cosine transforms","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integer DCT","multiplication-free transform","8\u00d78 DCT","signed DCT","image compression"]}],"publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412667/5418573/05418584.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2009.5418584","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2009.5418584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast 8\u00d78 transform for image compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418584/","displayDocTitle":"A fast 8\u00d78 transform for image compression","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151460","htmlLink":"/document/5418584/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast 8\u00d78 transform for image compression","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"p74ahmad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034646S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412667","isNumber":"5418573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412667","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5418573","articleId":"5418584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":5418585,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Gentile","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Gentile","id":"37401015200"},{"name":"Massimo Rovini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Rovini","id":"37394768200"},{"name":"Luca Fanucci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Fanucci","id":"37265849900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5816-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5814-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5815-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"5418585","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"abstract":"This paper deals with the design of a processor for very-finely spaced spectral analysis over a narrow band of the available spectrum.

This has lead to the development of highly-efficient SAT solvers that have been successfully applied to solve a wide-range of problems in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Networking, Fault Tolerance, Security, and Scheduling. Examples of such problems include automatic test pattern generation for stuck-at faults (ATPG), formal verification of hardware and software, circuit delay computation, FPGA routing, power leakage minimization, power estimation, circuit placement, graph coloring, wireless communications, wavelength assignment, university classroom scheduling, and failure diagnosis in wireless sensor networks. SAT solvers have recently been extended to handle Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints which are linear inequalities with integer coefficients. This feature allowed SAT solvers to handle optimization problems, as opposed to only decision problems, and to be applied to a variety of new applications. Recent work has also showed that free open source SAT-based PB solvers can compete with the best generic Integer Linear Programming (ILP) commercial solvers such as CPLEX. This tutorial is aimed at introducing the latest advances in S AT technology. Specifically, we describe the simple new input format of SAT solvers and the common SAT algorithms used to solve decision/optimization problems. In addition, we highlight the use of SAT algorithms in solving a variety of EDA decision and optimization problems and compare its performance to generic ILP solvers. This should guide researchers in solving their existing optimization problems using the new SAT technology. Finally, we provide a prospective on future work on SAT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tutorial proposal efficient solving of optimization problems using advanced boolean satisfiability and Integer Linear Programming techniques","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2009.5418586","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412667/5418573/05418586.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2009.5418586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tutorial proposal efficient solving of optimization problems using advanced boolean satisfiability and Integer Linear Programming techniques","conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5418586/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tutorial proposal efficient solving of optimization problems using advanced boolean satisfiability and Integer Linear Programming techniques","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"p6aloul.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076683S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412667","isNumber":"5418573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412667","xplore-issue":"5418573","articleId":"5418586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5418593,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Matolin","affiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Matolin","id":"37267061200"},{"name":"Christoph Posch","affiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Posch","id":"37394392300"},{"name":"Rainer Wohlgenannt","affiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Wohlgenannt","id":"37395107900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5816-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5814-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5815-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"5418593","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"abstract":"This paper presents analytical considerations and practical thoughts leading to the design and implementation of a low power, small-area voltage comparator for pixel-level signal processing in time-based image sensors.

Most of these modular VLSI system designs are generally multi objective in nature with the requisite to tradeoff between many contradictory parameters like speed, power consumed, cost and hardware area. They are heavily used in low end ASIC's which demand low power consumption and cost with acceptable performance and in high end ASIC's with high performance requirement. This paper presents a novel framework for the optimization of computing architecture based on hierarchy factor method. The determination of this hierarchy factor enables the designer to arrange the various resources of the system in the form of an architecture tree based on the application and the user specifications. The resulting structure would act as a pathway for obtaining the optimal architecture design option for multi objective optimization of the computing architecture used in many VLSI designs. The framework for optimization of computing architecture shown in this paper has been deduced and proved mathematically. The proposed method is capable to determine the most influential resource for a certain performance parameter in the whole system which is deduced by considering the mathematical model of the performance metric. The representation of our approach in the form of architecture tree allows easy automation of the process, useful for many multi objective optimized VLSI designs.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2009.5418618","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412667/5418573/05418618.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2009.5418618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418573","startPage":"328","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel framework of Optimizing modular computing architecture for multi objective VLSI designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel framework of Optimizing modular computing architecture for multi objective VLSI designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418618/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11146293","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5418618/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel framework of Optimizing modular computing architecture for multi objective VLSI designs","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"p328sedaghat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108331S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412667","isNumber":"5418573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412667","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5418573","articleId":"5418618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5418619,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The second approach, Incrementally Social PSO (ISPSO); is utilizing a variable weight for the social term (xg-x). This variability enables changing the social relationship between the particles from highly repulsive to highly attractive. Finally, we proposed a new Control inspired approach, PID-PSO, where we dealt with the PSO motion as a process that needs a controller to be optimized. It is quite common to use PSO to tune PID parameters but in this context we used PID to tune PSO motion. The performances of these three proposed approaches were measured on an extensive real data sets and used along with the understanding of the physical problem to offer various explanations of the theoretical aspects of the new algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2009.5418619","startPage":"316","endPage":"319","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412667/5418573/05418619.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2009.5418619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnects parasitic extraction using modified Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Libraries","Curve fitting","Integrated circuit interconnections","Motion control","Frequency","Buildings","Sampling methods","Ant colony optimization","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit interconnections","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnects parasitic extraction","modified particle swarm optimization","curve fitting problem","parasitic extraction macromodeling application","Wiggling PSO","incrementally social PSO","social relationship","extensive real data sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Natural Optimization","Particle Swarm Optimization","Macro modeling","Parasitic Extraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interconnects parasitic extraction using modified Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5418619/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11146294","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnects parasitic extraction using modified Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"p316abdellatif.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070838S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412667","isNumber":"5418573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412667","xplore-issue":"5418573","articleId":"5418619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5418622,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the classical HARQ case, when the received packet is erroneous, the system should send a NACK to ask the transmitter to re-send the same packet. Known that in this case, the receiver could use different copies of the emitted signal to ensure a combination of ARQ, we propose in our approach to transmit different copies of the same packet, but simultaneously over multiple antennas, in order to provide a MIMO system. This approach makes possible the recovering of the erroneous packets, by using the received copies instead of asking for a retransmission, which is very time- and treatment- consuming. The temporary diversity is assured by applying the interleaver to each copy of the transmitted packet, as well as the determination of the emitted signal's copies by using the Blind Separation Sources (BSS) concepts, without prior information about the transmission channel. The simulations show that the proposed scheme provides good results in term of frame error rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2009.5418633","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412667/5418573/05418633.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2009.5418633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418573","startPage":"268","endPage":"271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new Hybrid ARQ scheme based on Blind Separation Sources over MIMO system in multipaths radio fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new Hybrid ARQ scheme based on Blind Separation Sources over MIMO system in multipaths radio fading channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418633/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11151445","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5418633/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new Hybrid ARQ scheme based on Blind Separation Sources over MIMO system in multipaths radio fading channel","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"p268faqihi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049633S","chronDate":"19-22 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5412667","isNumber":"5418573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5412667","xplore-issue":"5418573","articleId":"5418633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5418634,"authors":[{"name":"Escid Hammoudi","affiliation":["Instrumentation Laboratory, University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Escid","lastName":"Hammoudi","id":"37395401300"},{"name":"Attari Mokhtar","affiliation":["Instrumentation Laboratory, University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Attari","lastName":"Mokhtar","id":"37393003900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5816-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5814-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5815-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"5418634","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1042},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Low-noise amplifiers","Dynamic range","Topology","Displays","Power supplies","Voltage","Photoconductivity","Predictive models","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","network topology","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS transimpedance amplifier","low noise amplifiers","dynamic range","transimpedance gain","network topology","PSPICE tools","voltage 3.3 V","size 0.35 \u03bcm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transimpedance amplifiers","CMOS technology","low-noise amplifier","optical receiver","negative feedback"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418634","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2009.5418634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2009.5418634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418573","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microelectronics - ICM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5412667/5418573/05418634.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low noise and high bandwidth 0.35 \u00b5m CMOS transimpedance amplifier","abstract":"This paper describes and analyzes the optimization of a low-noise and high-bandwidth transimpedance amplifier featuring a large dynamic range.

One important issue which greatly affects the performance of a multicast switch is how to reduce data loss caused by blocking during the process of duplication and routing of the packets. This paper proposes a multicast crossbar switch with an inner queue at each cross point. With the proposed architecture, no additional control circuits are needed for performing duplication and self-routing. To reduce data loss, duplicated packets are first stored in the inner queues, then continue to transmit at the beginning of the next time slot. By controlling the interarrival time of two sequential groups of packets, our approach can reduce the rate of data loss to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n or less. Due to simplicity of the proposed architecture, hardware implementation can be realized with ease while delivering good scalability and stackability.

Then, we can estimate channel parameter except for the inverse matrix which needs high complexity by using quasi-Newton methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCE.2010.5418758","publicationTitle":"2010 Digest of Technical Papers International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Digest of Technical Papers International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5410747/5418683/05418758.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE.2010.5418758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-newton based Kalman filter channel estimation for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418758/","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-newton based Kalman filter channel estimation for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11146097","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5418758/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-newton based Kalman filter channel estimation for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"cr141165506634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048921S","chronDate":"9-13 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5410747","isNumber":"5418683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5410747","xplore-issue":"5418683","articleId":"5418758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5418801,"authors":[{"name":"Taskeed Jabid","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taskeed","lastName":"Jabid","id":"37398184200"},{"name":"Md.

Compared with the phasor solutions used in transient stability analysis, the proposed approach may capture a wider range of eigenvalues and system operating states. An important advantage of extracting the system eigenvalues from the EMTP solution is the ability of the EMTP to follow the characteristics of nonlinearities. In addition, the algorithm can be used as a tool to identify network partitioning subsystems suitable for real-time hybrid power system simulator environments, including the implementation of multi-time-scale solutions.

The results clearly demonstrated the improved classification accuracy compared with other alternatives and showed that it can be used as a reliable tool for power transformer fault analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2040491","startPage":"1350","endPage":"1360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2040491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5512898/05418850.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-Adaptive RBF Neural Network Classifier for Transformer Fault Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418850/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Self-Adaptive RBF Neural Network Classifier for Transformer Fault Analysis","volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5418850/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11416712","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Adaptive RBF Neural Network Classifier for Transformer Fault Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dong-2040491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100942S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5512898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5512898","articleId":"5418850","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":5418856,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Luo","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada","School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5602023/5418856/5418856-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Luo (M'09) received the Ph.D. in computer science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, in 2006.","From 2006 to 2008, he has worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.

When used for vision, AER sensors and processors are not restricted to capturing and processing still image frames, as in commercial frame-based video technology, but sense and process visual information in a pixel-level event-based frameless manner. As a result, vision processing is practically simultaneous to vision sensing, since there is no need to wait for sensing full frames. Also, only meaningful information is sensed, communicated, and processed. Of special interest for brain-like vision processing are some already reported AER convolutional chips, which have revealed a very high computational throughput as well as the possibility of assembling large convolutional neural networks in a modular fashion. It is expected that in a near future we may witness the appearance of large scale convolutional neural networks with hundreds or thousands of individual modules. In the meantime, some research is needed to investigate how to assemble and configure such large scale convolutional networks for specific applications. In this paper, we analyze AER spiking convolutional neural networks for texture recognition hardware applications. Based on the performance figures of already available individual AER convolution chips, we emulate large scale networks using a custom made event-based behavioral simulator. We have developed a new event-based processing architecture that emulates with AER hardware Manjunath's frame-based feature recognition software algorithm, and have analyzed its performance using our behavioral simulator. Recognition rate performance is not degraded. However, regarding speed, we show that recognition can be achieved before an equivalent frame is fully sensed and transmitted.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2039943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5441221/05418872.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2039943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441221","startPage":"609","endPage":"620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Vision Through Frameless Event-Based Sensing and Convolutional Processing: Application to Texture Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Vision Through Frameless Event-Based Sensing and Convolutional Processing: Application to Texture Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418872/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208111","pubMedId":"20181543","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5418872/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Vision Through Frameless Event-Based Sensing and Convolutional Processing: Application to Texture Recognition","sourcePdf":"tnn-blinares-barranco-2039943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139616S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5441221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5441221","articleId":"5418872","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5418879,"authors":[{"name":"Urs Denier","affiliation":["Austria MicroSystems Switzerland AG, Rapperswil, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5545511/5418879/5418879-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Urs Denier (M'07) was born in Jona, Switzerland, in 1973.

In order to reduce the number of memory access operations, we used several techniques such as bitwidth reduction of the Gaussian parameters, multiframe computation of the emission probability, and two-stage language model pruning. We also employ a customized DRAM controller that supports various access patterns optimized for each functional unit of the speech recognizer. The speech recognition hardware was synthesized for the Virtex-4 FPGA, and it operates at 100 MHz.

Existing results in compressed sensing literature have focused on characterizing the achievable performance by bounding the number of samples required for a given level of signal sparsity. However, using these bounds to minimize the number of samples requires a priori knowledge of the sparsity of the unknown signal, or the decay structure for near-sparse signals. Furthermore, there are some popular recovery methods for which no such bounds are known. In this paper, we investigate an alternative scenario where observations are available in sequence. For any recovery method, this means that there is now a sequence of candidate reconstructions. We propose a method to estimate the reconstruction error directly from the samples themselves, for every candidate in this sequence. This estimate is universal in the sense that it is based only on the measurement ensemble, and not on the recovery method or any assumed level of sparsity of the unknown signal. With these estimates, one can now stop observations as soon as there is reasonable certainty of either exact or sufficiently accurate reconstruction. They also provide a way to obtain \u00bfrun-time\u00bf guarantees for recovery methods that otherwise lack a priori performance bounds. We investigate both continuous (e.g., Gaussian) and discrete (e.g., Bernoulli) random measurement ensembles, both for exactly sparse and general near-sparse signals, and with both noisy and noiseless measurements.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5431087/05418893.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431087","startPage":"435","endPage":"444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Compressed Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418893/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11172106","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5418893/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"jstsp-malioutov-2038211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121802S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5431087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5431087","articleId":"5418893","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5418903,"authors":[{"name":"Teruhiko Umatani","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Japan"],"firstName":"Teruhiko","lastName":"Umatani","id":"37395428900"},{"name":"Kohei Ohno","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Ohno","id":"37264993800"},{"name":"Makoto Itami","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Itami","id":"37284644000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4314-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4316-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-3994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-4001"}],"articleNumber":"5418903","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","OFDM","Additive noise","Phase noise","Noise level","Phase estimation","Amplitude estimation","Noise generators","Degradation","Decision feedback equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","impulse noise","interference suppression","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulse noise reduction","OFDM","time domain impulse noise","power-line communication","multi-path channels"]}],"abstract":"In OFDM transmission, performance is degraded by the existence of time domain impulse noise because this noise has very wide bandwidth and it affects all the carriers in the OFDM symbol.

First, an efficient transmit scheme, which bears partial information of the correlation matrix of the transmitted signal called SPF data, is proposed for the cancellation of signal-perturbation error at the receiver. A detailed transmit structure is designed to implement the SPF scheme, which is then employed along with linear prediction (LP) to derive a new semiblind channel-estimation algorithm. It is shown that the new transmit scheme can completely cancel the signal-perturbation error in the noise-free case while being able to sufficiently suppress the perturbation error in noisy conditions. It is also shown that the SPF data needs only to be transmitted over a small number of subcarriers, and its overhead to the overall transmission is negligible as compared with regular pilot signals. Computer simulations show that the proposed SPF solution significantly outperforms the LP semiblind method without using the proposed transmit scheme as well as the least square method in terms of the mean-square error of the channel estimate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Signal-Perturbation-Free Transmit Scheme for MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2041506","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5545511/05418908.pdf","startPage":"2208","endPage":"2220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2041506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5545511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Signal-Perturbation-Free Transmit Scheme for MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5418908/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11464088","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Signal-Perturbation-Free Transmit Scheme for MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-swamy-2041506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078546S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5545511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5545511","articleId":"5418908","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5418914,"authors":[{"name":"Bukar Umar Musa","affiliation":["Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5437451/5418914/5418914-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bukar Umar Musa (M'09) received the B.Eng. degree in Electrical and Electronic (Hons.) at the University of Maiduguri, Maiduguri, Nigeria, in 1994 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K., in 2003 and 2009, respectively.","In 1995, he joined the Borno State Rural Electrification Board where was actively involved in the design and construction of town distribution networks and intertown connection networks.

The generated fields may interfere and disrupt normal operations of electronic equipment. Hence, the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of this electronic equipment has to be considered as early as the design stage of substation planning and operation. Also, microelectronics are being introduced into the substation environment and are located close to the switching devices in the switchyards more than ever before, often referred to as distributed electronics. Hence, there is the need to re-evaluate the substation environment for EMC assessment, accounting for these issues.

The method is based on periodic boundary conditions, hence necessitating that the medium under study be periodic along the direction of truncation.

The proposed formulation does not need any additional auxiliary variables when applied to dispersive media, unlike the PML.

The major scientific question that we ask in this paper if it is possible to alter the gait of healthy individuals using special purpose design of robots and training paradigms. This paper describes novel experimental results with an active leg exoskeleton (ALEX) and a force-field controller (FFC) developed for neuromotor training of gait and rehabilitation of patients with walking disabilities. ALEX is a motorized leg orthosis having a total of 7 DOFs with hip and knee actuated in the sagittal plane. The FFC applies forces on the foot to help the leg move on a desired trajectory. The interaction forces between the subject and the orthosis are designed to be \u00bfassist-as-needed\u00bf for safe and effective gait training. Simulations and experimental results with the FFC are presented. Experiments have been performed on six healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. It was shown that a healthy subject could be retrained in about 45 min with ALEX to walk on a treadmill with a considerably altered gait. In the coming months, this powered orthosis will be used for gait training of stroke patients.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5439994/05418998.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2010.2041245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2010.2041245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5439994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5418998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Gait Adaptation and Neuromotor Training Results Using an Active Leg Exoskeleton","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leg","Exoskeletons","Rehabilitation robotics","Legged locomotion","Force control","Hip","Knee","Foot","Robot sensing systems","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","gait analysis","medical robotics","orthotics","patient rehabilitation","robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel gait adaptation","active leg exoskeleton","force-field controller","gait neuromotor training","patient rehabilitation","motorized leg orthosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Force-field control","gait rehabilitation","rehabilitation robotics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5418998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Novel Gait Adaptation and Neuromotor Training Results Using an Active Leg Exoskeleton","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5418998/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206111","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Gait Adaptation and Neuromotor Training Results Using an Active Leg Exoskeleton","sourcePdf":"tmech-agrawal-2041245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084077S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5439994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5439994","articleId":"5418998","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419000,"authors":[{"name":"Tasshi Dennis","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Tasshi","lastName":"Dennis","id":"37266795900"},{"name":"Paul A.

Calculations show that a waveguide with a wide core supporting higher order modes leads to strong absorption comparable to the two-dimensional model. Besides, embedding the core in a substrate is quite effective in obtaining a sharp dip in the wavelength response, i.e., a full-width at half-minimum is reduced from \u00bf11 to \u00bf5 nm, when the core is embedded by 0.3 \u00bfm.

Here, a series of classification analyses with two hyperspectral sensor data sets reveals that the accuracy of a classification by an SVM does vary as a function of the number of features used. Critically, it is shown that the accuracy of a classification may decline significantly (at 0.05 level of statistical significance) with the addition of features, particularly if a small training sample is used. This highlights a dependence of the accuracy of classification by an SVM on the dimensionality of the data and, therefore, the potential value of undertaking a feature-selection analysis prior to classification. Additionally, it is demonstrated that, even when a large training sample is available, feature selection may still be useful. For example, the accuracy derived from the use of a small number of features may be noninferior (at 0.05 level of significance) to that derived from the use of a larger feature set providing potential advantages in relation to issues such as data storage and computational processing costs. Feature selection may, therefore, be a valuable analysis to include in preprocessing operations for classification by an SVM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","volume":"48","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11246735","htmlLink":"/document/5419028/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Feature Selection for Classification of Hyperspectral Data by SVM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Selection for Classification of Hyperspectral Data by SVM","sourcePdf":"tgrs-pal-2039484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097085S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5447593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"482","xplore-issue":"5447593","articleId":"5419028","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5419029,"authors":[{"name":"Jort Florent Gemmeke","affiliation":["Center of Language and Speech Technology, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5431087/5419029/5419029-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jort Florent Gemmeke (S'09) received the M.Sc. degree in physics from the Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA), Amsterdam, The Netherlands in 2005.

Conventional imputation techniques employ parametric models and impute the missing features on a frame-by-frame basis. At low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), these techniques fail, because too many time frames may contain few, if any, reliable features. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-parametric, exemplar-based method for reconstructing clean speech from noisy observations, based on techniques from the field of Compressive Sensing. The method, dubbed sparse imputation, can impute missing features using larger time windows such as entire words. Using an overcomplete dictionary of clean speech exemplars, the method finds the sparsest combination of exemplars that jointly approximate the reliable features of a noisy utterance. That linear combination of clean speech exemplars is used to replace the missing features. Recognition experiments on noisy isolated digits show that sparse imputation outperforms conventional imputation techniques at SNR = -5 dB when using an ideal `oracle' mask. With error-prone estimated masks sparse imputation performs slightly worse than the best conventional technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11172102","htmlLink":"/document/5419029/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing for Missing Data Imputation in Noise Robust Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sensing for Missing Data Imputation in Noise Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"jstsp-gemmeke-2039171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190677S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5431087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5431087","articleId":"5419029","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419036,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5431087/5419036/5419036-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Jin was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1984.

This completely perturbed framework extends the prior work of Candes, Romberg, and Tao on stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements. Our results show that, under suitable conditions, the stability of the recovered signal is limited by the noise level in the observation. Moreover, this accuracy is within a constant multiple of the best-case reconstruction using the technique of least squares.

In this paper, a clamping-force control algorithm is presented along with a consideration of the frictional characteristics and the estimation of the clamping force for a planetary reduction gear-type EMB. The frictional model is developed by including the frictional effect of the motor, the planetary gear, and the screw thread. Since the clamping-force estimation requires the distance of the contact gap between the pad and the disk, an initial gap-distance control algorithm that uses the gradient change of the motor torque is proposed. This paper is concluded with a discussion of the performance of the control algorithm by comparing the simulation results with the experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2043696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5571765/05419051.pdf","startPage":"3205","endPage":"3212","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2043696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clamping-Force Control for Electromechanical Brake","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Clamping-Force Control for Electromechanical Brake","volume":"59","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5419051/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523633","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clamping-Force Control for Electromechanical Brake","sourcePdf":"tvt-kim-2043696-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051998S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5571765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5571765","articleId":"5419051","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5419054,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Gook Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5484898/5419054/5419054-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byung-Gook Kim received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering in 2007 from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include resource allocation, opportunistic scheduling in wireless networks, and network optimization."]},"firstName":"Byung-Gook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37402020600"},{"name":"Jang-Won Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5484898/5419054/5419054-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jang-Won Lee (M'04) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2004.","From 1997 to 1998, he was with Dacom R&D Center, Daejeon.

In most previous works on relay-based networks, immediate relaying at relay stations (RSs) without allowing opportunistic scheduling at RSs was considered. Under this strategy, each RS should transmit the received data from the base station (BS) to the corresponding mobile stations (MSs) immediately within a single time slot, and thus, the effective data rate of the two-hop transmission (BS-RS and RS-MS links) is limited by the achievable data rate of the link with a worse channel state between the two links, resulting in a waste of radio resources. However, if opportunistic scheduling is allowed not only at the BS but at each RS as well, then more efficient radio resource allocation could be possible. Considering time-varying wireless channels, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem that aims at maximizing the average sum rate of the system while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement of each MS. By solving the problem, we develop a joint opportunistic subchannel and power-scheduling algorithm for transmission at both the BS and the RSs. Numerical results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can significantly improve system performance by allowing opportunistic scheduling at both the BS and the RSs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5484898/05419054.pdf","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Since noise is always present in practical data acquisition systems, sensing, and reconstruction methods are developed assuming a Gaussian (light-tailed) model for the corrupting noise. However, when the underlying signal and/or the measurements are corrupted by impulsive noise, commonly employed linear sampling operators, coupled with current reconstruction algorithms, fail to recover a close approximation of the signal. In this paper, we propose robust methods for sampling and reconstructing sparse signals in the presence of impulsive noise. To solve the problem of impulsive noise embedded in the underlying signal prior the measurement process, we propose a robust nonlinear measurement operator based on the weighed myriad estimator. In addition, we introduce a geometric optimization problem based on \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization employing a Lorentzian norm constraint on the residual error to recover sparse signals from noisy measurements. Analysis of the proposed methods show that in impulsive environments when the noise posses infinite variance we have a finite reconstruction error and furthermore these methods yield successful reconstruction of the desired signal. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform commonly employed compressed sensing sampling and reconstruction techniques in impulsive environments, while providing comparable performance in less demanding, light-tailed environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Sampling and Reconstruction Methods for Sparse Signals in the Presence of Impulsive Noise","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2039177","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5431087/05419057.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2039177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419057/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust Sampling and Reconstruction Methods for Sparse Signals in the Presence of Impulsive Noise","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5419057/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11172094","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Sampling and Reconstruction Methods for Sparse Signals in the Presence of Impulsive Noise","sourcePdf":"jstsp-rcarrillo-2039177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105116S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5431087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5431087","articleId":"5419057","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5419058,"authors":[{"name":"Mark A.

Our notion of optimality is defined in terms of phase transitions, i.e., we maximize the number of nonzeros at which the algorithm can successfully operate. We show that the phase transition is a well-defined quantity with our suite of random underdetermined linear systems. Our tuning gives the highest transition possible within each class of algorithms. We verify by extensive computation the robustness of our recommendations to the amplitude distribution of the nonzero coefficients as well as the matrix ensemble defining the underdetermined system. Our findings include the following. 1) For all algorithms, the worst amplitude distribution for nonzeros is generally the constant-amplitude random-sign distribution, where all nonzeros are the same amplitude. 2) Various random matrix ensembles give the same phase transitions; random partial isometries may give different transitions and require different tuning. 3) Optimally tuned subspace pursuit dominates optimally tuned CoSaMP, particularly so when the system is almost square.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419070","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reconstruction algorithms","Compressed sensing","Iterative algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Proposals","Equations","Pursuit algorithms","Sparse matrices","Linear systems","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","signal reconstruction","sparse matrices","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative reconstruction algorithms","compressed sensing","sparse solutions","underdetermined linear systems","matrix ensembles","random partial isometries","optimal tuning","linear equations","thresholding","degree of sparsity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","iterative algorithms","phase transition","random matrices","thresholding"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5431087/05419070.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2039176","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2039176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimally Tuned Iterative Reconstruction Algorithms for Compressed Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419070/","displayDocTitle":"Optimally Tuned Iterative Reconstruction Algorithms for Compressed Sensing","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11172108","volume":"4","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimally Tuned Iterative Reconstruction Algorithms for Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"jstsp-maleki-2039176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057498S","chronDate":"April  2010","isNumber":"5431087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"182","articleId":"5419070","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419071,"authors":[{"name":"David Wipf","affiliation":["Biomagnetic Imaging Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["David Wipf received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, San Diego.","Currently, he is an NIH Postdoctoral Fellow in the Biomagnetic Imaging Lab, University of California, San Francisco.

Many of the underlying algorithms rely on iterative reweighting schemes that produce more focal estimates as optimization progresses. Two such variants are iterative reweighted l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n minimization; however, some properties related to convergence and sparse estimation, as well as possible generalizations, are still not clearly understood or fully exploited. In this paper, we make the distinction between \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">separable</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">non-separable</i>\n iterative reweighting algorithms. The vast majority of existing methods are separable, meaning the weighting of a given coefficient at each iteration is only a function of that individual coefficient from the previous iteration (as opposed to dependency on all coefficients). We examine two such separable reweighting schemes: an l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n method from Chartrand and Yin (2008) and an l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n approach from Cande's (2008), elaborating on convergence results and explicit connections between them. We then explore an interesting non-separable alternative that can be implemented via either l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n or l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n reweighting and maintains several desirable properties relevant to sparse recovery despite a highly non-convex underlying cost function. For example, in the context of canonical sparse estimation problems, we prove uniform superiority of this method over the minimum l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n solution in that, 1) it can never do worse when implemented with reweighted l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n, and 2) for any dictionary and sparsity profile, there will always exist cases where it does better. These results challenge the prevailing reliance on strictly convex (and separable) penalty functions for finding sparse solutions. We then derive a new non-separable variant with similar properties that exhibits further performance improvements in empirical tests. Finally, we address natural extensions to group sparsity problems and non-negative sparse coding.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042413","startPage":"317","endPage":"329","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5431087/05419071.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Reweighted - and - Methods for Finding Sparse Solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Reweighted <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ell_1$</tex></formula> and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ell_2$</tex></formula> Methods for Finding Sparse Solutions","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419071/","accessionNumber":"11172104","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419071/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Reweighted <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ell_1$</tex></formula> and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ell_2$</tex></formula> Methods for Finding Sparse Solutions","sourcePdf":"04jstsp02-dwipf-2042413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116271S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5431087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"5431087","articleId":"5419071","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":5419072,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Mishali","affiliation":["Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5431087/5419072/5419072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Moshe Mishali (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (summa cum laude) from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, in 2000, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","From 1996 to 2000, he was a member of the Technion Program for Exceptionally Gifted Students.

In this paper, we consider the challenging problem of blind sub-Nyquist sampling of multiband signals, whose unknown frequency support occupies only a small portion of a wide spectrum. Our primary design goals are efficient hardware implementation and low computational load on the supporting digital processing. We propose a system, named the modulated wideband converter, which first multiplies the analog signal by a bank of periodic waveforms. The product is then low-pass filtered and sampled uniformly at a low rate, which is orders of magnitude smaller than Nyquist. Perfect recovery from the proposed samples is achieved under certain necessary and sufficient conditions. We also develop a digital architecture, which allows either reconstruction of the analog input, or processing of any band of interest at a low rate, that is, without interpolating to the high Nyquist rate. Numerical simulations demonstrate many engineering aspects: robustness to noise and mismodeling, potential hardware simplifications, real-time performance for signals with time-varying support and stability to quantization effects. We compare our system with two previous approaches: periodic nonuniform sampling, which is bandwidth limited by existing hardware devices, and the random demodulator, which is restricted to discrete multitone signals and has a high computational load. In the broader context of Nyquist sampling, our scheme has the potential to break through the bandwidth barrier of state-of-the-art analog conversion technologies such as interleaved converters.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5431087/05419072.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Theory to Practice: Sub-Nyquist Sampling of Sparse Wideband Analog Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"From Theory to Practice: Sub-Nyquist Sampling of Sparse Wideband Analog Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419072/","publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11172099","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419072/","volume":"4","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Theory to Practice: Sub-Nyquist Sampling of Sparse Wideband Analog Signals","sourcePdf":"04jstsp02-mmishali-2042414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096841S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5431087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"749","xplore-issue":"5431087","articleId":"5419072","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5419073,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Calderbank","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5431087/5419073/5419073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Calderbank (M89\u2013SM97\u2013F98) received the B.Sc. degree from Warwick University, Coventry, U.K., in 1975, the M.Sc. degree from Oxford University, Oxford, U.K., in 1976, and the Ph.D. degree from the California Institute of Technology, Paseadena, in 1980, all in mathematics.","He is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, where he directs the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics.

In the standard compressed sensing paradigm, the N \u00d7 C measurement matrix \u00bf is required to act as a near isometry on the set of all k-sparse signals (restricted isometry property or RIP). Although it is known that certain probabilistic processes generate N \u00d7 C matrices that satisfy RIP with high probability, there is no practical algorithm for verifying whether a given sensing matrix \u00bf has this property, crucial for the feasibility of the standard recovery algorithms. In contrast, this paper provides simple criteria that guarantee that a deterministic sensing matrix satisfying these criteria acts as a near isometry on an overwhelming majority of k-sparse signals; in particular, most such signals have a unique representation in the measurement domain. Probability still plays a critical role, but it enters the signal model rather than the construction of the sensing matrix. An essential element in our construction is that we require the columns of the sensing matrix to form a group under pointwise multiplication. The construction allows recovery methods for which the expected performance is sub-linear in C, and only quadratic in N, as compared to the super-linear complexity in C of the Basis Pursuit or Matching Pursuit algorithms; the focus on expected performance is more typical of mainstream signal processing than the worst case analysis that prevails in standard compressed sensing. Our framework encompasses many families of deterministic sensing matrices, including those formed from discrete chirps, Delsarte-Goethals codes, and extended BCH codes.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2043161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5431087/05419073.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2043161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431087","startPage":"358","endPage":"374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of a Large Class of Deterministic Sensing Matrices That Satisfy a Statistical Isometry Property","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Construction of a Large Class of Deterministic Sensing Matrices That Satisfy a Statistical Isometry Property","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419073/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11172097","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5419073/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of a Large Class of Deterministic Sensing Matrices That Satisfy a Statistical Isometry Property","sourcePdf":"04jstsp02-rcalderbank-2043161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105159S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5431087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"5431087","articleId":"5419073","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5419075,"authors":[{"name":"Navas Khan","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, MicroSystems Modules and Components Laboratory, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6144/5429141/5419075/5419075-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Navas Khan received the B.E. degree in mechanical engineering from Bangalore University, Bangalore, India, in 1993, and the M.E. degree in mechanical engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2006.","He is a Member of the Technical Staff at the Microsystems, Modules and Components Laboratory, Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore.

At the SU, channel-state information (CSI) between its transmitter and the PU receiver is used to calculate the maximum allowable SU transmit power to limit the interference. We assume that this CSI is imperfect, which is an important scenario for CR systems. In addition to a peak received interference power constraint, an upper limit to the SU transmit power constraint is also considered. We derive a closed-form expression for the mean SU capacity under this scenario. Due to imperfect CSI, the SU cannot always satisfy the peak received interference power constraint at the PU and has to back off its transmit power. The resulting capacity loss for the SU is quantified using the cumulative-distribution function of the interference at the PU. Additionally, we investigate the impact of CSI quantization. To investigate the SU error performance, a closed-form average bit-error-rate (BER) expression was also derived. Our results are confirmed through comparison with simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2043454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2043454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05419086.pdf","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Limits and Performance Analysis of Cognitive Radio With Imperfect Channel Knowledge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Limits and Performance Analysis of Cognitive Radio With Imperfect Channel Knowledge","volume":"59","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419086/","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419086/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Limits and Performance Analysis of Cognitive Radio With Imperfect Channel Knowledge","sourcePdf":"tvt-shafi-2043454.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092281S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"354","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5419086","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5419087,"authors":[{"name":"K.-L.

Energy detection is simple and practical but becomes ineffective at a low signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). Conventional cyclostationary feature detection based on cyclic spectrum estimation can robustly detect weak signals from primary users by only exploiting the cyclostationarity property of communication signals. However, the high implementation complexity it requires limits its widespread usage. In the literature, the use of smart-antenna technology is suggested to track the locations of the primary users and apply transmit beamforming to avoid spatial interference with their signals. The objective of this paper is to establish adaptive cyclostationary (receive) beamforming as an effective spectrum-sensing method with affordable complexity for multiple-antenna cognitive radio. Specifically, we introduce a new spectrum-sensing method that exploits a recently proposed beamforming algorithm, called the adaptive cross-self-coherent-restoral (ACS) algorithm. The complexity of the resultant algorithm is higher than that of the energy detector but is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of the previous cyclostationary feature detectors, such as the Fourier spectrum cyclic density analysis method and its multitaper-Loe\u00bfve version. Their performances for spectrum sensing are empirically evaluated and compared in detail in an example.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2043860","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05419087.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2043860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"1877","endPage":"1886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Affordable Cyclostationarity-Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio With Smart Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Affordable Cyclostationarity-Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio With Smart Antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419087/","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5419087/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285960","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Affordable Cyclostationarity-Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio With Smart Antennas","sourcePdf":"tvt-mow-2043860.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083876S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5419087","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419088,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal M.

The task of estimating the sparsest coefficient vector in these models is a combinatorial problem and efficient, often suboptimal strategies have to be used. Fortunately, under certain conditions on the model, several algorithms could be shown to efficiently calculate near-optimal solutions. In this paper, we study one of these methods, the so-called Iterative Hard Thresholding algorithm. While this method has strong theoretical performance guarantees whenever certain theoretical properties hold, empirical studies show that the algorithm's performance degrades significantly, whenever the conditions fail. What is more, in this regime, the algorithm also often fails to converge. As we are here interested in the application of the method to real world problems, in which it is not known in general, whether the theoretical conditions are satisfied or not, we suggest a simple modification that guarantees the convergence of the method, even in this regime. With this modification, empirical evidence suggests that the algorithm is faster than many other state-of-the-art approaches while showing similar performance. What is more, the modified algorithm retains theoretical performance guarantees similar to the original algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5431087/05419091.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding: Guaranteed Stability and Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Signal processing algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Compressed sensing","Sampling methods","Vectors","Signal processing","Iterative methods","Inverse problems","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","signal processing","stability","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative hard thresholding","stability","sparse signal models","signal processing","sparsest coefficient vector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse signal modeling","compressed sensing (CS)","iterative hard thresholding","sparse inverse problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding: Guaranteed Stability and Performance","volume":"4","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5419091/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11172095","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding: Guaranteed Stability and Performance","sourcePdf":"04jstsp02-tblumensath-2042411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078088S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5431087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"262","xplore-issue":"5431087","articleId":"5419091","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5419092,"authors":[{"name":"Deanna Needell","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5431087/5419092/5419092-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Deanna Needell received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Davis, in 2009.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Departments of Statistics and Mathematics at Stanford University, Stanford, CA.

For the downstream, a precoder can compensate for this, provided that some crosstalk channel information is available at the transmitter. In this paper, we investigate the issue of precoder design based on a particular type of feedback: it is assumed that each receiver sends back the (complex) sign of the noise on the symbol detection as a way to provide the needed information on crosstalk channels. We derive an algorithm that makes use of this limited information in an adaptive way to iteratively compute the precoder. The performance of the proposed algorithm is extensively analyzed, both with theoretical evaluations and simulation results. The algorithm is also compared to other solutions, showing the efficient performance for the limited amount of overhead it requires.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","DSL","Feedback","Iterative algorithms","Bit rate","Wires","Transmitters","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","channel estimation","crosstalk","digital subscriber lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive precoding","downstream crosstalk precancelation","DSL systems","sign-error feedback","very high bit rate digital subscriber line systems","crosstalk channel information","symbol detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive algorithm","channel estimation","crosstalk","precoding","vectored DSL"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2043969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05419097.pdf","startPage":"3173","endPage":"3179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2043969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Precoding for Downstream Crosstalk Precancelation in DSL Systems Using Sign-Error Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Precoding for Downstream Crosstalk Precancelation in DSL Systems Using Sign-Error Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419097/","volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419097/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11304801","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Precoding for Downstream Crosstalk Precancelation in DSL Systems Using Sign-Error Feedback","sourcePdf":"tsp-louveaux-2043969-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038827S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5464420","articleId":"5419097","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419102,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos E.

As a suboptimal solution to DPC, successive zero-forcing DPC (SZF-DPC) has been proposed recently. The zero-interference constraint in designing the precoding matrices limits the number of supportable users. In this correspondence, we propose three low-complexity suboptimal user scheduling algorithms to exploit the multiuser diversity gain in SZF-DPC as the number of users grows. The first algorithm greedily maximizes the true sum rate. The second algorithm is based on eigenvalues. The third algorithm relies on the diagonal elements of the effective channel matrix since eigenvalues and diagonal entries of a Hermitian matrix have a strong relationship. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithms can obtain a significant fraction of sum rate of the optimal solution. Furthermore, the performance analysis is provided to prove that the proposed user selection algorithms can achieve the same asymptotic sum rate as that of DPC.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2043977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05419122.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2043977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","startPage":"3411","endPage":"3416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Diversity for Successive Zero-Forcing Dirty Paper Coding: Greedy Scheduling Algorithms and Asymptotic Performance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Diversity for Successive Zero-Forcing Dirty Paper Coding: Greedy Scheduling Algorithms and Asymptotic Performance Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11304798","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Diversity for Successive Zero-Forcing Dirty Paper Coding: Greedy Scheduling Algorithms and Asymptotic Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"58tsp06-ehong-2043977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079933S","chronDate":"June  2010","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","articleId":"5419122","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5419124,"authors":[{"name":"Aboulnasr Hassanien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5464420/5419124/5419124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aboulnasr Hassanien (M'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electronics and communications engineering and the M.Sc. degree in communications engineering from Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt, in 1996 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2006.","From 1997 to 2001, he was with the Department of Electrical Engineering, South Valley University, Aswan, Egypt.

The new technique enjoys the advantages of the MIMO radar without sacrificing the main advantage of the phased-array radar which is the coherent processing gain at the transmitting side. The essence of the proposed technique is to partition the transmit array into a number of subarrays that are allowed to overlap. Then, each subarray is used to coherently transmit a waveform which is orthogonal to the waveforms transmitted by other subarrays. Coherent processing gain can be achieved by designing a weight vector for each subarray to form a beam towards a certain direction in space. Moreover, the subarrays are combined jointly to form a MIMO radar resulting in higher angular resolution capabilities. Substantial improvements offered by the proposed phased-MIMO radar technique as compared to the phased-array and MIMO radar techniques are demonstrated analytically and by simulations through analyzing the corresponding beam patterns and the achievable output signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios. Both analytical and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed phased-MIMO radar.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2043976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05419124.pdf","startPage":"3137","endPage":"3151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2043976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phased-MIMO Radar: A Tradeoff Between Phased-Array and MIMO Radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Phased-MIMO Radar: A Tradeoff Between Phased-Array and MIMO Radars","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419124/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11304799","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419124/","volume":"58","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phased-MIMO Radar: A Tradeoff Between Phased-Array and MIMO Radars","sourcePdf":"tsp-vorobyov-2043976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113894S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"242","xplore-issue":"5464420","articleId":"5419124","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5419126,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5593944/5419126/5419126-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaguang Zhang (SM'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control engineering from Northeast Dianli University of China, Jilin City, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in thermal power engineering and automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1991.","He joined the Department of Automatic Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1992, as a Postdoctoral Fellow for two years.

The less conservative robust stability criteria for SNTNNs with time-varying delays are proposed by using a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and a novel series compensation (SC) technique. Based on the new functional, SNTNNs with fast-varying neutral-type delay (the derivative of delay is more than one) is first considered. The benefit brought by employing the SC technique is that some useful negative definite elements can be included in stability criteria, which are generally ignored in the estimation of the upper bound of derivative of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional in literature. Furthermore, the criteria proposed in this paper are also effective and less conservative in switched recurrent neural networks which can be considered as special cases of SNTNNs. The simulation results based on several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2040274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5593944/05419126.pdf","startPage":"1480","endPage":"1491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2040274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5593944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Delay-Dependent Robust Stability Analysis for Switched Neutral-Type Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays via SC Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419126/","displayDocTitle":"Novel Delay-Dependent Robust Stability Analysis for Switched Neutral-Type Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays via SC Technique","volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641529","pubMedId":"20181544","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419126/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Delay-Dependent Robust Stability Analysis for Switched Neutral-Type Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays via SC Technique","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zhang-2040274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127366S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5593944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5593944","articleId":"5419126","onlineDate":"22 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419176,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Pu","affiliation":["Sakurai Laboratory, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5419169/5419176/5419176-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Pu (M'09) received the B.S. degree (cum laude) in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004.

The measured tap delay frequency response variation is less than 1 dB up to 20 GHz and tap-to-tap delay variation is less than 0.3 ps. More than 50% vertical and 70% horizontal eye opening from a closed input eye are observed. The use of a CMOS process enables further integration of this core into a DFE equalizer or a CDR/Demux based receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5419169/05419189.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2039268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2039268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 80 mW 40 Gb/s 7-Tap <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">T</emphasis>/2-Spaced Feed-Forward Equalizer in 65 nm CMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS process","Delay","Calibration","Electrostatic discharge","Protection","Plastic packaging","Frequency measurement","Semiconductor device measurement","Frequency response","Decision feedback equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","CMOS integrated circuits","equalisers","optical communication","plastic packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feed-forward equalizer","CMOS process","calibration techniques","plastic package","tap delay frequency response","DFE equalizer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS analog integrated circuits","current mode logic","FFE","broadband communication","equalizers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"An 80 mW 40 Gb/s 7-Tap <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">T</emphasis>/2-Spaced Feed-Forward Equalizer in 65 nm CMOS","volume":"45","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5419189/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142424","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 80 mW 40 Gb/s 7-Tap <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">T</emphasis>/2-Spaced Feed-Forward Equalizer in 65 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"45jssc03-mgreen-2039268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05474S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5419169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5419169","articleId":"5419189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419190,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed El-Nozahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5419169/5419190/5419190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed El-Nozahi (S'00) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees, both in electrical engineering, from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.

But a pulsed latch that uses a single pulse width has a lower bound on its clock period, limiting its capacity to deal with higher frequencies or operate at lower \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Vdd</i>\n. The limitation still exists even when clock skew scheduling is employed, since the amount of skew that can be assigned and realized is practically limited due to process variation. For the first time, we formulate the problem of allocating pulse widths, out of a small discrete number of predefined widths, and scheduling clock skews, within a predefined upper bound on skew, for optimizing pulsed latch-based sequential circuits. We then present an algorithm called \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PWCS_Optimize</i>\n (pulse width allocation and clock skew scheduling, PWCS) to solve the problem. The allocated skews are realized through synthesis of local clock trees between pulse generators and latches, and a global clock tree between a clock source and pulse generators.

In this paper, a spectral preserve fusion method is developed by introducing a trous wavelet transform (AWT) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) into one generalized IHS transform, which extends panchromatic sharpening of low-resolution multispectral images (LRMIs) through detail injection to the fusion of LRMIs and synthetic aperture radar imagery (SARI). The original LRMIs are first transformed into one low-resolution intensity component (LRIC) and the details from the SARI are abstracted using AWT. The LRIC and the approximation image of the SARI are fused through an intrinsic mode functions based model. Subsequently, high RIC produced through an inverse AWT is then substituted for the old one. High RMIs are obtained through an inverse IHS transform. Experiments reveal that this approach performs better than the AWT and IHS-AWT-based methods in preserving the spectral information of the LRMIs. The performance of the image fusion is examined both visually and quantitatively.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2009.2038661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5416584/05419252.pdf","startPage":"737","endPage":"745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2009.2038661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR and Multispectral Image Fusion Using Generalized IHS Transform Based on \u00e0 Trous Wavelet and EMD Decompositions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419252/","displayDocTitle":"SAR and Multispectral Image Fusion Using Generalized IHS Transform Based on \u00e0 Trous Wavelet and EMD Decompositions","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142292","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419252/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR and Multispectral Image Fusion Using Generalized IHS Transform Based on \u00e0 Trous Wavelet and EMD Decompositions","sourcePdf":"jsen-su-2038661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116127S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5416584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5416584","articleId":"5419252","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419277,"authors":[{"name":"Abhisek Ukil","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research Limited, Baden-Dattwil, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5416584/5419277/5419277-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abhisek Ukil (S'05\u2013M'06) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Jadavpur University, Calcutta, India, in 2000, the M.Sc. degree in electronic systems and engineering management from the University of Bolton, Bolton, U.K., and Southwestphalia University of Applied Sciences, Soest, Germany, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, South Africa, in 2006.","After joining in 2006, currently he is a Principal Scientist at the Integrated Sensor Systems Group, ABB Corporate Research Center, Baden-Daettwil, Switzerland.

Calibration of NIR spectra refers to the use of the spectra as multivariate descriptors to predict concentrations of the constituents. To build a calibration model, state-of-the-art software predominantly uses linear regression techniques. For nonlinear calibration problems, neural network-based models have proved to be an interesting alternative. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of the conventional neural network-based approach, the use of an ensemble of neural network models. The individual neural networks are obtained by resampling the available training data with bootstrapping or cross-validation techniques. The results obtained for a realistic calibration example show that the ensemble-based approach produces a significantly more accurate and robust calibration model than conventional regression methods.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2009.2038124","startPage":"578","endPage":"584","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5416584/05419277.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2009.2038124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Calibration of Near-Infrared Spectra by Using Ensembles of Neural Network Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Neural networks","Spectroscopy","Frequency measurement","Wavelength measurement","Composite materials","Training data","Robustness","Fourier transforms","Electromagnetic wave absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer bootstrapping","electrical engineering computing","infrared spectroscopy","neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-infrared spectra","neural network models","near-infrared spectroscopy","multivariate descriptors","software predominantly","linear regression techniques","nonlinear calibration problems","cross-validation techniques","bootstrapping techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bootstrapping","calibration","chemometrics","committee","cross-validation","ensembles","Fourier transform near-infrared","near-infrared (NIR)","NIR spectrometer","neural network","spectra"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Improved Calibration of Near-Infrared Spectra by Using Ensembles of Neural Network Models","volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5419277/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11142317","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Calibration of Near-Infrared Spectra by Using Ensembles of Neural Network Models","sourcePdf":"jsen-ukil-2038124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073855S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5416584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5416584","articleId":"5419277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5419278,"authors":[{"name":"Chein-I Chang","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5416584/5419278/5419278-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chein-I Chang (S'81\u2013M'87\u2013SM'92\u2013F'10) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Soochow University, Taipei, Taiwan, the M.S. degree in mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, the M.A. degree in mathematics from the State University of New York, Stony Brook, the M.S. and M.S.E.E. degrees from the University of Illinois, Urbana\u2013Champaign, Urbana, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park.","Since 1987, he has been with the University of Maryland, Baltimore, where he is currently a Professor in the Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.

Example for mechanical optimization indicates that compared with the exiting algorithms, CIPSO gets better result, thus certify the improvement of the algorithm's searching ability by immunity mechanism and chaos initiation particle swarm.","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5419305/5419418/05419466.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaos Immune Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Hybrid Discrete Variables and its Application to Mechanical Optimization","doi":"10.1109/IITAW.2009.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITAW.2009.10","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Chaos Immune Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Hybrid Discrete Variables and its Application to Mechanical Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11154049","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5419466/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaos Immune Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Hybrid Discrete Variables and its Application to Mechanical Optimization","confLoc":"Nanchang, China","sourcePdf":"3860a190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043053S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5419305","isNumber":"5419418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5419305","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5419418","articleId":"5419466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5419479,"authors":[{"name":"Pen Tao","affiliation":["Railway Traffic Department, Hunan Railway Professional Technology College, Zhuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Pen","lastName":"Tao","id":"38275416500"},{"name":"Zeng Zhe-zhao","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zeng","lastName":"Zhe-zhao","id":"38273590500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6421-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6420-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5419479","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Signal processing algorithms","Rail transportation","Educational institutions","Information technology","Neural networks","Electronic mail","Communication system control","Control systems","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","neural nets","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","zeros of polynomials","convergence rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","polynomials","zeros","algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419479","abstract":"A fast and exact neural-network algorithm is proposed to find zeros of polynomials which were not solved by the most other methods.

A nonlinear programming problem is solved online in NMPC. GA has been successfully applied to nonlinear programming problems where other decent-based methods have often failed. In this paper GA is used to optimize the control sequence per sampling time. In order to reduce the computational load on nonlinear model based predictive controllers, the key idea in this scheme is to seek a feasible descent solution rather than the optimal solution at each sampling time. The feasible solution decreases the cost function rather than minimizing the cost function. This strategy considerably reduces the online computation time at each search step, while maintaining good overall performance via iterative GA search. The low-complexity feature of the proposed algorithm makes it attractive for practical control systems with stringent requirements on fast sampling and large prediction horizon. A proof of nominal stability of the closed-loop system is also given in the paper. Computer simulations on continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and experimental tests on the coupled-tank system are carried out to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed predictive control technique.","doi":"10.1109/IITAW.2009.46","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5419305/5419418/05419481.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITAW.2009.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suboptimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Based on Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Predictive control","Genetic algorithms","Sampling methods","Cost function","Continuous-stirred tank reactor","Prediction algorithms","Load modeling","Optimal control","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical industry","chemical reactors","genetic algorithms","predictive control","suboptimal control","tanks (containers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal nonlinear model","predictive control","genetic algorithm","suboptimal nonlinear control","nonlinear programming problem","control sequence","cost function","continuous stirred tank reactor","process industry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonlinear model predictive control","genetic algorithm","feasible solution","coupled-tank system","continuous stirred tank reactor","suboptimal nonlinear model predictive control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Suboptimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Based on Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419481/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11154064","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suboptimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Nanchang, China","sourcePdf":"3860a119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059467S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5419305","isNumber":"5419418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5419305","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5419418","articleId":"5419481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5419639,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Even with an error-tolerance mechanism, scaling voltage below a critical voltage - so-called overscaling - results in more timing errors than can be effectively detected or corrected. This limits the effectiveness of voltage scaling in trading off system reliability and power. We propose a design-level approach to trading off reliability and voltage (power) in, e.g., microprocessor designs. We increase the range of voltage values at which the (timing) error rate is acceptable; we achieve this through techniques for power-aware slack redistribution that shift the timing slack of frequently-exercised, near-critical timing paths in a power- and area-efficient manner. The resulting designs heuristically minimize the voltage at which the maximum allowable error rate is encountered, thus minimizing power consumption for a prescribed maximum error rate and allowing the design to fail more gracefully. Compared with baseline designs, we achieve a maximum of 32.8% and an average of 12.5% power reduction at an error rate of 2%. The area overhead of our techniques, as evaluated through physical implementation (synthesis, placement and routing), is no more than 2.7%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419690.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419690","startPage":"825","endPage":"831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slack redistribution for graceful degradation under voltage overscaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419690/","displayDocTitle":"Slack redistribution for graceful degradation under voltage overscaling","htmlLink":"/document/5419690/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11153917","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slack redistribution for graceful degradation under voltage overscaling","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p82510A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06247S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5419778,"authors":[{"name":"W.

ESL verification methodology is employed in the design regression of EPC C1Gen2 RFID tag. Around 200 times speedup is observed using ESL over conventional RTL simulation in regression runs (after logic bug fixes). This clearly shows ESL verification is a successful candidate to reuse high-level test harness for IC functional verification, especially in today's increasingly complex IC design world. On top of the successful use of the ESL functional verification flow on the design, we also show the infrastructure to use SystemC Verification Library (SCV) for formal verification. The functional and formal verification combined is thus the proposed ESL verification methodology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419778","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419778.pdf","startPage":"821","endPage":"824","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practice of ESL verification methodology from SystemC to FPGA - using EPC Class-1 Generation-2 RFID tag design as an example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A practice of ESL verification methodology from SystemC to FPGA - using EPC Class-1 Generation-2 RFID tag design as an example","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5419778/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11153759","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419778/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practice of ESL verification methodology from SystemC to FPGA - using EPC Class-1 Generation-2 RFID tag design as an example","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p8219D4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051974S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5419781,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Cui","affiliation":["School of Computing Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jin Cui","id":"37087894879"},{"name":"Douglas L.

An event driven thermal estimation method which can assist dynamic TAS is proposed in this paper. The event driven thermal estimation is based upon a thermal map which is updated only when a high level event occurs. To minimize the overhead, while maintaining the estimation accuracy, the prebuilt look-up-tables and the superposition principle are used to speed up the solution of the thermal RC network. Experimental results show our method is accurate, producing thermal estimations of similar quality to existing thermal simulators, while having a considerably reduced computational complexity. Our event driven thermal estimation technique is significantly better, in terms of accuracy, than existing TAS schedulers, making it highly suitable for integration into the OS kernel.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419781","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419781.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419781/","displayDocTitle":"High level event driven thermal estimation for thermal aware task allocation and scheduling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11153762","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419781/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High level event driven thermal estimation for thermal aware task allocation and scheduling","confLoc":"Taipei","sourcePdf":"p7939C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045025S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5419810,"authors":[{"name":"Lakshmi N.

Public-key cryptography, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC), is extensively used but conventional scan-based attacks cannot be applied to it, because it has a complicated algorithm as well as a complicated architecture. This paper proposes a scan-based attack which enables us to decipher a secret key in ECC. The proposed method is based on detecting intermediate values calculated in ECC. By monitoring the 1-bit sequence in the scan path, we can find out the register position specific to the intermediate value in it and we can know whether this intermediate value is calculated or not in the target ECC circuit. By using several intermediate values, we can decipher a secret key. The experimental results demonstrate that a secret key in a practical ECC circuit can be deciphered using 29 points over the elliptic curve E within 40 seconds.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419848.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scan-based attack against elliptic curve cryptosystems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curve cryptography","Circuits","Large scale integration","Public key cryptography","Registers","Galois fields","Memory architecture","Polynomials","Information retrieval","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","large scale integration","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scan-based attack","elliptic curve cryptosystem","secret key decipher","cryptography circuit","public-key cryptography","RSA","register position","ECC circuit","LSI chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Scan-based attack against elliptic curve cryptosystems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419848/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11153827","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scan-based attack against elliptic curve cryptosystems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p4075B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104336S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5419851,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Lung Tzeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jian-Lung Tzeng","id":"37408056400"},{"name":"Chien-Jen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Jen Huang","id":"37407380000"},{"name":"Yu-Han Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Han Yuan","id":"37401231200"},{"name":"Hsi-Pin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsi-Pin Ma","id":"37403465900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5765-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5767-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"5419851","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","MIMO","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","Detectors","Feedback","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","MIMO communication","transceivers","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop MIMO applications","high performance low complexity joint transceiver","MIMO transceiver","transmitter antenna","QR detector","GMD precoding","feedback channel","computational complexity","V-BLAST","Xilinx FPGA"]}],"abstract":"An efficient and practicable MIMO transceiver in which transmitter antenna selection is applied to QR detector and GMD precoding through limited feedback channel is implemented.

This paper presents an improved template-based algorithm that automatically conducts performance-constrained parasitic-aware retargeting and optimization of analog layouts. In order to achieve desired circuit performance, performance sensitivities with respect to layout parasitics are first determined. Then the algorithm applies a piecewise-sensitivity model to control parasitic-related layout geometries by directly constructing a set of performance constraints subject to maximum performance deviation due to parasitics. The formulated problem is finally solved using graph-based techniques combined with mixed-integer nonlinear programming.

Post-silicon validation has thus become an essential step in the IC design flow. Tracing internal signals during circuit's normal operation, being able to provide real-time visibility to the circuit under debug (CUD), is one of the most effective silicon debug techniques and has gained wide acceptance in industrial designs. Trace-based debug solution, however, involves non-trivial design for debug overhead. How to conduct signal tracing effectively for bug elimination is therefore a challenging task for IC designers. In this paper, we provide in-depth discussion for trace-based debug strategy and review recent advancements in this important area.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419883","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419883.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","startPage":"262","endPage":"267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On signal tracing in post-silicon validation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On signal tracing in post-silicon validation","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419883/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11153861","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5419883/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On signal tracing in post-silicon validation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p2623D5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074014S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5419884,"authors":[{"name":"Zigang Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zigang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37069258900"},{"name":"Evangeline F.Y.

It offers a promising platform for various kinds of biochemical experiments. DMFB that uses cross-referencing technology to drive droplets movements scales down the control pin number on chip, which not only brings down manufacturing cost but also allows large-scale chip design. However, the cross-referencing scheme that imposes different voltage on rows and columns to activate the cells, might cause severe electrode interference, and hence greatly decreases the degree of parallelism of droplet routing. Most of the previous papers get a direct-addressing result first, and then convert to cross-referencing compatible result. This paper proposes a new method that solves the droplet routing problem on cross-referencing biochip directly. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in comparison with the latest work on this problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419884/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419884/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11153862","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"CrossRouter: A droplet router for cross-referencing digital microfluidic biochips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CrossRouter: A droplet router for cross-referencing digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p2694A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051318S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5419895,"authors":[{"name":"Dimin Niu","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Dimin Niu","id":"37409787700"},{"name":"Yibo Chen","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Yibo Chen","id":"37407069300"},{"name":"Xiangyu Dong","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiangyu Dong","id":"37407343000"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Yuan Xie","id":"37275778900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5765-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5767-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"5419895","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit synthesis","Phase change memory","Phase change random access memory","Voltage","Scalability","Fabrication","Energy dissipation","Memory management","Design optimization","Read-write memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated memory circuits","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit design","phase-change memory","phase-change random access memory","energy dissipation","power consumption","read stability","write stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419895","abstract":"Phase-Change Random Access Memory (PRAM) has become one of the most promising emerging memory technologies, due to its attractive features such as high density, fast access, non-volatility, and good scalability.

In this paper, we explore the use of Inter-Band Tunnel Field Effect Transistors (TFETs) in SRAMs at ultra low supply voltages. The uni-directional current conducting TFETs limit the viability of 6 T SRAM cells. To overcome this limitation, 7 T SRAM designs were proposed earlier at the cost of extra silicon area. In this paper, we propose a novel 6 T SRAM design using Si-TFETs for reliable operation with low leakage at ultra low voltages. We also demonstrate that a functional 6 T TFET SRAM design with comparable stability margins and faster performances at low voltages can be realized using proposed design when compared with the 7 T TFET SRAM cell. We achieve a leakage reduction improvement of 700 X and 1600 X over traditional CMOS SRAM designs at V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n of 0.3 V and 0.5 V respectively which makes it suitable for use at ultra-low power applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419897/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419897/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11153875","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel Si-Tunnel FET based SRAM design for ultra low-power 0.3V VDD applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel Si-Tunnel FET based SRAM design for ultra low-power 0.3V VDD applications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p1813A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079294S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5419898,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Tzu Lin","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chang-Tzu Lin","id":"38180355900"},{"name":"Ding-Ming Kwai","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ding-Ming Kwai","id":"37294410600"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Chou","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Fa Chou","id":"37265084400"},{"name":"Ting-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ting-Sheng Chen","id":"37402472700"},{"name":"Wen-Ching Wu","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Ching Wu","id":"37280430300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5765-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5767-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"5419898","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Delay","Clocks","Design automation","Integrated circuit interconnections","Frequency","Bandwidth","Large scale integration","Bonding","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD reference flow","3D via-last integrated circuits","IC design","3D large-scale integration","high performance cores","face-to-back bonding style","2D IC physical design tools","TSV-aware mixed-sized placement","clock tree synthesis","homogeneous die stack","flow 2D timing-driven routing","off-line design rule check","layout versus schematic verification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419898","abstract":"Next-decade computing power and interconnect bottle-neck challenge conventional IC design due to the ever increasing demands for high frequency and great bandwidth. Three-dimensional large-scale integration (3D-LSI) provides an opportunity to realize such high performance cores while reducing long latency. In this paper, we present a reference flow for the implementation of 3D via-last ICs in scalable face-to-back bonding style which leverages a mature set of 2D IC physical design tools. The first enabling technology of 3D-LSI is through-silicon via (TSV). Two kinds of TSV diameters are exemplified in the flow, namely, 5\u00bfm and 50\u00bfm. We propose an easy-to-adopt method to address the TSV-aware mixed-sized placement by considering the obstructions generated from adjacent-tier's floorplan, subject to certain TSV alignment constraints. Furthermore, the technique of clock tree synthesis (CTS) for a homogeneous die stack is developed to dramatically reduce the clock latency and skew. The mixed-sized placement and CTS of each tier can be done without iteration. To the best of our knowledge, no work has ever been published in literature discussing CTS for 3D via-last integration in a face-to-back fashion. Finally, to complete the proposed flow 2D timing-driven routing and modified off-line design rule check (DRC) and layout versus schematic (LVS) verification are performed very well.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419898","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419898.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAD reference flow for 3D via-last integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"CAD reference flow for 3D via-last integrated circuits","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419898/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11153876","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAD reference flow for 3D via-last integrated circuits","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p1873A4s.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085019S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5419899,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Falkenstern","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Falkenstern","id":"37392804500"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Yuan Xie","id":"37275778900"},{"name":"Yao-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yao-Wen Chang","id":"37279580700"},{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["TNlist, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yu Wang","id":"37293645500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5765-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5767-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"5419899","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419899","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Routing","Network synthesis","Space technology","Electronic design automation and methodology","Wires","Integrated circuit synthesis","Design optimization","Computer science","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","integrated circuit layout","network routing","simulated annealing","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D integrated circuit","3D IC floorplan","power/ground network cosynthesis","3D design","3D EDA tool","P/G network","IR drops","P/G cosynthesis tool","P/G routing","3D B*-tree floorplan","resistive P/G mesh","simulated annealing"]}],"abstract":"Three dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) are currently being developed to improve existing 2D designs by providing smaller chip areas and higher performance and lower power consumption. However, before 3D ICs become a viable technology, the 3D design space needs to be fully explored and 3D EDA tools need to be developed. To help explore the 3D design space and help fill the need for 3D EDA tools, the 3D floorplan and power/ground (P/G) co-synthesis tool is developed in this work, which develops the floorplan and the P/G network concurrently. Most current 3D IC floorplanners neglect the effects of the 3D P/G network on the design, which may lead to large IR drops in the circuit. To create feasible floorplans with efficient P/G networks, the 3D floorplan and P/G co-synthesis tool optimizes the floorplan in terms of wirelength, area and P/G routing area and IR drops. The tool integrates a 3D B*-tree floorplan representation, a resistive P/G mesh, and a simulated annealing (SA) engine to explore the 3D floorplan and P/G network. The results of experiments using the 3D floorplan and P/G co-synthesis tool show that 3D ICs tend to increase the P/G routing area while decreasing the IR drops in the circuit. By considering the IR drop while floorplanning, exploring the 3D P/G design space, and evaluating 3D IC's effect on 3D P/G networks, the 3D floorplan and P/G co-synthesis tool can develop a more efficient 3D IC.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419899","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419899.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D IC) Floorplan and Power/Ground Network Co-synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D IC) Floorplan and Power/Ground Network Co-synthesis","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11153877","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D IC) Floorplan and Power/Ground Network Co-synthesis","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p1693A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092203S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5419905,"authors":[{"name":"Shuichi Aono","affiliation":["Incubation Division 215, SESAME Technology, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuichi","lastName":"Aono","id":"37411433100"},{"name":"Masaki Unno","affiliation":["Incubation Division 215, SESAME Technology, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Unno","id":"37394039400"},{"name":"Hideki Asai","affiliation":["Incubation Division 215, SESAME Technology, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Asai","id":"37283278100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5765-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5767-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"5419905","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Boundary conditions","Equations","Electromagnetic fields","Computational modeling","Perfectly matched layers","Computer simulation","Large-scale systems","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic field theory","electromagnetic wave absorption","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alternating-direction explicit method","absorbing boundary condition","finite-difference time-domain method","electromagnetic field simulation","perfectly matched layer","computer simulations","FDTD algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) method using the alternating-direction explicit (ADE) method for the efficient electromagnetic field simulation.

We show that by sampling along the imaginary axis and performing a new complex-valued reduction, the reduced model will match exactly with the original model at the sample points. We show theoretically that the proposed method can achieve the error bound over a given frequency range. Practically the new algorithm can help designers choose the best order of the reduced model for the given frequency range and error bound via adaptive sampling scheme. As a result, it can perform wideband accurate reductions of interconnect circuits for analog and RF applications. We compare several sampling schemes such as linear, logarithmic, and recently proposed re-sampling methods. Experimental results on a number of RLC circuits show that WBMOR is much more accurate than all the other simple sampling methods and the recently proposed re-sampling scheme with the same reduction orders.

Polychronous) specification languages do not assume that execution proceeds by sampling inputs at predetermined global synchronization points. The software synthesized from such specifications are paced by arrival of certain inputs, or evaluation of certain internal variables. Here, we present an alternate polychronous model of computation termed Multi-rate Instantaneous Channel connected Data Flow (MRICDF) actor network model. Sequential embedded software from MRICDF specifications can be synthesized using epoch analysis, a technique proposed to form a unique order of events without a reference time line. We show how to decide on the implementability of MRICDF specification and how additional epoch information can help in synthesizing deterministic sequential software. The semantics of an MRICDF is akin to that of SIGNAL, but is visual and easier to specify. Also, our prime implicate based epoch analysis technique avoids the complex clock-tree based analysis required in SIGNAL. We experimented with the usability of MRICDF formalism by creating EmCodeSyn, our visual specification and synthesis tool. Our attempt is to make polychronous specification based software synthesis more accessible to engineers, by proposing this alternative model with different semantic exposition and simpler analysis techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419925","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419925.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An alternative polychronous model and synthesis methodology for model-driven embedded software","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An alternative polychronous model and synthesis methodology for model-driven embedded software","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5419925/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11153903","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419925/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative polychronous model and synthesis methodology for model-driven embedded software","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p0131A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060091S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5419927,"authors":[{"name":"Jason H.

Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are circuits that compute a unique signature for a given IC based on the process variations inherent in the IC manufacturing process. This paper presents the first PUF design specifically targeted for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Our novel design makes use of the underlying FPGA architecture, and unlike prior published PUFs, the proposed PUF can be naturally embedded into a design's HDL, consuming very little area, and does not require the use of \"hard macros\" with fixed routing. Measured results on the Xilinx Virtex-5 65 nm FPGA demonstrate PUF signatures to be both unique and reliable under temperature variation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PUF design for secure FPGA-based embedded systems","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419927","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419673","publicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5415928/5419673/05419927.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A PUF design for secure FPGA-based embedded systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419927/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11153919","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PUF design for secure FPGA-based embedded systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p0011A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071323S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5415928","isNumber":"5419673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5415928","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5419673","articleId":"5419927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5419948,"authors":[{"name":"Apostolos P.

Previous methods for time delay recovery either operate on the analog received signal, or require sampling at the Nyquist rate of the transmitted pulse. In this paper, we develop a unified approach to time delay estimation from low-rate samples. This problem can be formulated in the broader context of sampling over an infinite union of subspaces. Although sampling over unions of subspaces has been receiving growing interest, previous results either focus on unions of finite-dimensional subspaces, or finite unions. The framework we develop here leads to perfect recovery of the multipath delays from samples of the channel output at the lowest possible rate, even in the presence of overlapping transmitted pulses, and allows for a variety of different sampling methods. The sampling rate depends only on the number of multipath components and the transmission rate, but not on the bandwidth of the probing signal. This result can be viewed as a sampling theorem over an infinite union of infinite dimensional subspaces. By properly manipulating the low-rate samples, we show that the time delays can be recovered using the well-known ESPRIT algorithm. Combining results from sampling theory with those obtained in the context of direction of arrival estimation, we develop sufficient conditions on the transmitted pulse and the sampling functions in order to ensure perfect recovery of the channel parameters at the minimal possible rate.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2044253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","startPage":"3017","endPage":"3031","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05419949.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Delay Estimation From Low-Rate Samples: A Union of Subspaces Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5419949/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time-Delay Estimation From Low-Rate Samples: A Union of Subspaces Approach","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11304804","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Delay Estimation From Low-Rate Samples: A Union of Subspaces Approach","sourcePdf":"58tsp06-kgedalyahu-2044253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142035S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5464420","articleId":"5419949","onlineDate":"25 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5419951,"authors":[{"name":"Naoto Yorino","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5512898/5419951/5419951-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naoto Yorino (M'90) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1981, 1983, and 1987, respectively.","He is a Professor in the Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.

The novel scheme is designed according to the constant modulus (CM) criterion subject to different constraints. The proposed scheme consists of a bank of full-rank adaptive filters that forms the transformation matrix, and an adaptive reduced-rank filter that operates at the output of the bank of filters to estimate the desired signal. We describe the proposed scheme for both the direct-form processor (DFP) and the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structures. For each structure, we derive stochastic gradient (SG) and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms for its adaptive implementation. The Gram-Schmidt (GS) technique is applied to the adaptive algorithms for reformulating the transformation matrix and improving the performance. An automatic rank selection technique is developed and employed to determine the most adequate rank for the derived algorithms. A detailed complexity study and a convexity analysis are carried out. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing full-rank and reduced-rank methods in convergence and tracking performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2044250","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05419962.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2044250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2983","endPage":"2997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank Constrained Constant Modulus Algorithms Based on Joint Iterative Optimization of Filters for Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank Constrained Constant Modulus Algorithms Based on Joint Iterative Optimization of Filters for Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419962/","volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5419962/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11304806","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank Constrained Constant Modulus Algorithms Based on Joint Iterative Optimization of Filters for Beamforming","sourcePdf":"58tsp06-lwang-2044250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120401S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5464420","articleId":"5419962","onlineDate":"25 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5419971,"authors":[{"name":"Montu Doshi","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronic Center, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA","Performance Power Products Group, National Semiconductor Corporation, Longmont, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5491380/5419971/5419971-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Montu Doshi (M'09) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder, in 2007, where he is working toward the Ph.D. degree.","In 2009, he joined the National Semiconductor Corporation, Longmont, CO, where he is currently a Senior Applications Engineer and involved in development of custom integrated circuit for solid-state lamps.

For a SSL consisting of multiple high-brightness LEDs (HBLEDs) that are electrically connected as a series-parallel network, the desired output luminance is obtained by modulating the average current through each parallel HBLED string. In conventional pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and pulse code modulation techniques, the average HBLED string current is controlled by simultaneously varying the \u201con\u201d time duration of each current regulator circuit, resulting in large current transients and pulsating light output. The proposed MPWM technique operates by uniformly time-shifting the individual on/off control signal pulses, thus avoiding large current transients. When compared to conventional PWM dimming, MPWM dimming reduces the risk of visible flicker and lowers the magnitude of audible noise. The reduced magnitude of output current transients results in lower electromagnetic interference and enables optimization of the size of passive components. In this paper, the operation of the MPWM technique is explained in detail. Experimental results are presented for a 27 W boost converter powering 64 HBLEDs with digital MPWM and digital voltage loop implemented using a Virtex-4 field programmable gate arrays.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Lamps","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse modulation","Pulse width modulation","Pulse circuits","Modulation coding","Optical modulation","Electromagnetic transients","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brightness","digital control","LED lamps","lighting control","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiphase pulsewidth modulation technique","solid state lamp control","luminance Control","high brightness LED","series-parallel network","current regulator circuit","PWM dimming","electromagnetic interference","passive components","digital voltage loop","boost converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital control","LED dimming","LED lamp driver","multiphase pulsewidth modulation","solid-state lamp luminance control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2043447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5491380/05419971.pdf","startPage":"1894","endPage":"1904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5491380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2043447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Solid-State Lamps Using a Multiphase Pulsewidth Modulation Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of Solid-State Lamps Using a Multiphase Pulsewidth Modulation Technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419971/","volume":"25","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419971/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11373779","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Solid-State Lamps Using a Multiphase Pulsewidth Modulation Technique","sourcePdf":"tpel-doshi-2043447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064135S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5491380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5491380","articleId":"5419971","onlineDate":"25 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5419974,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Alioto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Siena, Siena, Italy","Berkeley Wireless Research Center Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Massimo Alioto (M'01\u2013SM'07) was born in Brescia, Italy, in 1972.

Analysis significantly extends previous analyses, which considered the simplistic case of a single FinFET device or extremely simple circuits. Results show that analysis of a single device cannot predict the layout density of FinFET cells, due to the additional spacing constraints imposed by the standard cell structure. Results on the layout density of FinFET standard cell circuits are derived by building and analyzing various cell libraries in 32-nm technology, based on three-terminal (3T) and four-terminal (4T) devices, as well as on the recently proposed cells with mixed 3T-4T devices (MT). The results obtained for spacer- and lithography-defined FinFETs are observed from the technology scaling perspective by also considering 45- and 65-nm libraries. The effect of the fin and cell height on the layout density is studied. Results show that 3T and MT FinFET standard cells can have the same layout density as bulk cells (or better) for low (moderate) fin heights. Instead, 4T standard cells have an unacceptably worse layout density. Hence, MT standard cells turn out to be the only viable option to apply back biasing in FinFET standard cell circuits.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Evaluation of Layout Density in 3T, 4T, and MT FinFET Standard Cells","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2040094","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5755591/05419976.pdf","startPage":"751","endPage":"762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2040094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5755591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419976/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Evaluation of Layout Density in 3T, 4T, and MT FinFET Standard Cells","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5419976/","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11972042","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Evaluation of Layout Density in 3T, 4T, and MT FinFET Standard Cells","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-malioto-2040094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087286S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5755591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5755591","articleId":"5419976","onlineDate":"25 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419977,"authors":[{"name":"Ren-Jie Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ren-Jie","lastName":"Lee","id":"37290116200"},{"name":"Hung-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281171600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5419977","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":771},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419977","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","Design optimization","Time to market","Costs","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Electronics packaging","Power generation","Signal generators","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ball grid arrays","chip-on-board packaging","circuit layout","circuit optimisation","integrated circuit interconnections","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip-package-board codesign","package pin-out planning","system interconnects optimization","ball grid array","time-to-market","power delivery integrity","pin-block design","floorplanning","printed circuit board","high-speed interface IP designs","USB","PCI Express","pin-block side","industrial chipset design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pin-out planning","package-board codesign","system interconnects optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2041562","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5755591/05419977.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","startPage":"904","endPage":"909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5755591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2041562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Package Pin-Out Planning With System Interconnects Optimization for Package-Board Codesign","abstract":"In conventional package design, engineers designate the ball grid array (BGA) pin-out manually, this always postpones the time-to-market (TTM) of products due to the turn-around between package and design houses. Recent papers propose a method of automatically generating the pin-out and taking signal integrity (SI), power delivery integrity (PI), and routability (RA) into account simultaneously by pin-block design and floorplanning, thus dramatically speeding up the developing time. However, this approach ignores the considerations of shorter path length and equilength/length matching in routing printed circuit board (PCB) trace and pin-out assignment for high-speed interface IP designs, such as USB and PCI Express. Since these features are the most important performance metrics during chip-package-board codesign, in this paper we propose the ideas to optimize the system interconnects during package pin-out design. These ideas keep the same minimized package size as aforementioned recent work and ensure that SI, PI, and RA can still be considered with significant reduction in design cost. It is achieved by relaxing the restriction of pin-block side and order on the package, usually specified by package designers. The experimental results on industrial chipset design cases show that the average improvement of our pin-block planner is over 40% when comparing the design cost with the previous work, among which we have one case accommodated over a thousand pins. Our ideas also work for any kind of pin-block or pin-group configurations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11972043","volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5419977/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Package Pin-Out Planning With System Interconnects Optimization for Package-Board Codesign","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Package Pin-Out Planning With System Interconnects Optimization for Package-Board Codesign","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-rlee-2041562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044669S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5755591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5755591","articleId":"5419977","onlineDate":"25 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5419980,"authors":[{"name":"Subho Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5755591/5419980/5419980-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Subho Chatterjee (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Jadavpur University, Calcutta, India, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2009.

The proposed multisensor/multialgorithm fusion method, which is called context-dependent fusion (CDF), is motivated by the fact that the relative performance of different sensors and algorithms can vary significantly depending on the mine type, geographical site, soil and weather conditions, and burial depth. CDF is a local approach that adapts the fusion method to different regions of the feature space. The training part of CDF has two components: context extraction and algorithm fusion. In context extraction, the features used by the different algorithms are combined and used to partition the feature space into groups of similar signatures, or contexts. The algorithm fusion component assigns a degree of worthiness to each detector in each context based on its relative performance within the context. To test a new alarm using CDF, each detection algorithm extracts its set of features and assigns a confidence value. Then, the features are used to identify the best context, and the degrees of worthiness of this context are used to fuse the individual confidence values. Results on large and diverse ground-penetrating radar and wideband electromagnetic data collections show that the proposed method can identify meaningful and coherent clusters and that different expert algorithms can be identified for the different contexts. Typically, the contexts correspond to groups of alarm signatures that share a subset of common features. Our extensive experiments have also indicated that CDF outperforms all individual detectors and the global fusion that uses the same method to assign aggregation weights.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2010","volume":"48","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"11293255","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419982/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Context-Dependent Multisensor Fusion and Its Application to Land Mine Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Dependent Multisensor Fusion and Its Application to Land Mine Detection","sourcePdf":"tgrs-frigui-2039936-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163933S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5464431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5464431","articleId":"5419982","onlineDate":"25 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419984,"authors":[{"name":"John E.

Our alignment mechanism takes advantage of miniaturized versions of two of nature's idealized shapes: an inverse pyramidal shape defined by a self-terminating wet-etch process in silicon and micro-spheres with radii accurate to submicron accuracy. This approach allows chips to be packaged using passive alignment that is self locating and reaches nearly one micron level of chip misalignment tolerance. Packages for applications to capacitive and optical connections are presented. Additionally, we describe a physical architecture for a multi-chip array packages with \u00bfbridge\u00bf and \u00bfisland\u00bf chips where the function of the bridge is to transfer electromagnetic signals between island chips using either capacitive or optical proximity communication. The bridge chip can provide a predetermined amount of compliance to help maintain alignment and thereby accommodate topology variants in first level package or in chip thickness when required. Experimental packages providing precise alignment between 1-D arrays and 2-D arrays of chips are presented. We show that our precision alignment mechanism enables high fidelity 10 Gb/s optical-proximity-communication with reflecting mirrors micro-machined into Silicon and co-integrated to low loss silicon-on-insulator waveguides for chip-to-chip communication. The alignment mechanism was also applied to a demonstration of chip-to-chip capacitive proximity communication in a linear array of six chips. Alignment measurements on a 4 \u00d7 4 array of chips are reported.","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2009.2037437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/5458300/05419984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2009.2037437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5458300","startPage":"389","endPage":"397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aligning Chips Face-to-Face for Dense Capacitive and Optical Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Aligning Chips Face-to-Face for Dense Capacitive and Optical Communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11282269","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5419984/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aligning Chips Face-to-Face for Dense Capacitive and Optical Communication","sourcePdf":"tadvp-jcunningham-2037437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073448S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"5458300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5458300","articleId":"5419984","onlineDate":"25 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419985,"authors":[{"name":"Adriana Serban","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/5536890/5419985/5419985-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adriana Serban received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from Politehnica University, Bucharest, Romania.

In traditional OLS and OLA implementations, the system is compelled to be time-invariant and conventional filter synthesis techniques are used for designing the block filter. In this paper, based on the OLS and the OLA structures, we develop a fast algorithm for designing the optimal OLS and OLA block filters using a quadratic criterion. Comparing OLA to OLS optimal design, we demonstrate that, as in classical design approaches, they show no difference when the filters are time-invariant. However, when aliasing is not zero, although the global aliasing is the same, its components with respect to frequency are different. This conclusion is supported by simulation results, and a comparison between the optimal approach and some other standard approaches is also provided.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2044260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5464420/05419990.pdf","startPage":"3066","endPage":"3075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2044260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlap-Save and Overlap-Add Filters: Optimal Design and Comparison","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5419990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5419990/","displayDocTitle":"Overlap-Save and Overlap-Add Filters: Optimal Design and Comparison","volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11304812","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5419990/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlap-Save and Overlap-Add Filters: Optimal Design and Comparison","sourcePdf":"58tsp06-adaher-2044260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054908S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5464420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5464420","articleId":"5419990","onlineDate":"25 February 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5419994,"authors":[{"name":"Johanna Ketonen","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5464420/5419994/5419994-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Johanna Ketonen (S'07) received the M.Sc.

The linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) and the -best list sphere detector (LSD) are compared to the iterative successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector and the iterative -best LSD. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in 3G long-term evolution (LTE) system. The SIC algorithm is found to perform worse than the -best LSD when the MIMO channels are highly correlated, while the performance difference diminishes when the correlation decreases. The receivers are designed for 22 and 4 4 antenna systems and three different modulation schemes. Complexity results for FPGA and ASIC implementations are found. A modification to the -best LSD which increases its detection rate is introduced. The ASIC receivers are designed to meet the decoding throughput requirements in LTE and the -best LSD is found to be the most complex receiver although it gives the best reliable data transmission throughput. The SIC receiver has the best performance-complexity tradeoff in the system but in the 4 4 case, the -best LSD is the most efficient. A receiver architecture which could be reconfigured to using a simple or a more complex detector as the channel conditions change would achieve the best performance while consuming the least amount of power in the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2044290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal
