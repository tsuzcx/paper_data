In 1978 Sammet chaired the ACM/SIGPLAN Conference on the History of Programming Languages (HOPL) from which the text of the same title was created. In that volume are both a formal paper on the history of COBOL and the transcript of Sammet's presentation. This following article is an unedited extract from the formal paper, reprinted with the permission of ACM and Academic Press. We chose not to reprint the complete paper here because it is readily accessible, but we are printing a significant portion of it to provide Annals readers with an overview of the early COBOL development. The full version of the paper was reviewed in draft form by most of the key participants of that time period; they generally did not object to the information provided. Thus, that paper and the extract printed here present an accurate description of which people participated, or played major roles, or did not participate in the language definition.","doi":"10.1109/MAHC.1985.10044","publicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488650/4640594/04640598.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1985.10044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4640594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brief Summary of the Early History of COBOL","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Brief Summary of the Early History of COBOL","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brief Summary of the Early History of COBOL","sourcePdf":"a4288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107244S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4640594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488650","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4640598","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4640600,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0164-1239"}],"articleNumber":"4640600","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4640600","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Meetings","Programming","Data systems","Data processing","Automatic programming","History"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MAHC.1985.10047","publicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488650/4640594/04640600.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"325","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04640600.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1985.10047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4640594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Meetings of the Conference on Data Systems Languages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640600/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Early Meetings of the Conference on Data Systems Languages","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early Meetings of the Conference on Data Systems Languages","sourcePdf":"a4316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038564S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4640594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488650","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4640600","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4640628,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Ceruzzi","affiliation":["Department of Space Science and Exploration, Smithsonian Institution, National Air and Space Museum Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Ceruzzi","id":"37352899500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0164-1239"}],"articleNumber":"4640628","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4640628","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer science","Space technology","Electrical engineering","History","Space exploration","Electron tubes","Software systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper explores the relation ship between two disciplines: electrical engineering and computer science, over the past 40 years.

The underlying logical design of most modern computers is still based on that of the earliest electronic computers despite decades of progress in electronic circuitry. the innovations that have occurred in computer architecture have been driven by two different goals: higher performance and lower cost. Performance driven improvements have yielded computer systems with increasingly higher computation speeds and throughput. Cost driven improvements have yielded systems that are easier to use and applicable to a broader range of automatic control problems. Improvements in electronic circuitry have not led directly to architectural innovations; computers that pioneered new circuit technologies usually relied on older architectural concepts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Dec.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  1988","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1988","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","volume":"10","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Historical Overview of Computer Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Historical Overview of Computer Architecture","sourcePdf":"a4277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080151S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  1988","isNumber":"4640624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488650","citationCount":"23","articleId":"4640629","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4640662,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis J.

The systems offer a new means of communication for those with paralysis or severe neuromuscular disorders. BCI technology is a relatively new, fast-growing field of research and applications with the potential to improve the quality of life in severely disabled people. To date, several BCI prototypes exist, but most work only in a laboratory environment. Before a BCI can be used for communication and control at home, research must solve several problems. An important next step is to establish protocols for easily setting up and using BCI systems in a practical environment. Many features, such as electrode positions and frequency components, must be automatically selectable for particular motor imagery. The system must use the fewest number of recording electrodes possible, striving for the optimal single EEG channel. Finally, training time must decrease, perhaps through game-like feedback and automatic detection of artifacts, such as uncontrolled muscle activity. With these improvements, which are on the horizon, we expect to see practical BCI systems for a wide range of users and applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2008.432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4640644","startPage":"58","endPage":"65","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/4640644/04640664.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rehabilitation with Brain-Computer Interface Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4640664/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Rehabilitation with Brain-Computer Interface Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10251412","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rehabilitation with Brain-Computer Interface Systems","sourcePdf":"mco2008100058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042467S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","isNumber":"4640644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"127","articleId":"4640664","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":4640665,"authors":[{"name":"Anatole L\u00e9cuyer","affiliation":["BUNRAKU team, French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control, France"],"bio":{"p":["Anatole L\u00e9cuyer is a senior researcher in the BUNRAKU team at the French National Research Institute for Computer Science and Control (INRIA).

Dantzig. The author worked intensively on this project there until late 1956, by which time great progress had been made on first-generation computers. The work continued at CEIR, Inc., in Washington for some years and later in many places by many individuals and firms. By the late 1960s, elaborate systems of programs known as mathematical programming systems (MPS) had become a standard part of the available software for a number of computers, notably the IBM 360, GE 635, CDC 6600, and Univac 1108. The major MPSs underwent significant updating and extension during the mid-1970s taking on their present and probably final form, at least for big mainframes. Work still continues, however, and substantial improvements are being made in speed, reliability, supporting data management and control systems, and application techniques. Development of quite powerful microcomputer systems is now underway.","doi":"10.1109/MAHC.1984.10032","publicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488650/4640720/04640725.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1984.10032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4640720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"History of Mathematical Programming Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Sept.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  1984","displayDocTitle":"History of Mathematical Programming Systems","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Sept. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"History of Mathematical Programming Systems","sourcePdf":"a3296.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042406S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  1984","isNumber":"4640720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488650","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4640725","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4640745,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur W.

This paper discusses differences in parental action modification depending on whether the goal or the means is more crucial. When demonstrating a task to an infant, parents try to emphasize the important aspects of the task by suppressing or adding their movement. Our hypothesis is that in a goal-crucial task, the initial and final states of the task should be highlighted by parental actions, whereas in a means-crucial task the movement is underlined. Our analysis using a saliency-based attention model partially verified it: When focusing on the goal, parents tended to emphasize the initial and final states of the objects used in the task by taking a long pause before/after they started/fulfilled the task. When focusing on the means, parents shook the object to highlight it, which consequently made its state invisible. We discuss our findings regarding the uniqueness and commonality of the parental action modification.

The in-place learning algorithm is used to develop the internal representation (including synaptic bottom-up and top-down weights of every neuron) in the network, such that every neuron is responsible for the learning of its own signal processing characteristics within its connected network environment, through interactions with other neurons in the same layer. In contrast with the previous fully connected MILN [13], the cells in each layer are locally connected in the network. Local analysis is achieved through multi-scale receptive fields, with increasing sizes of perception from earlier to later layers. The results of the experiments showed how one type of information (ldquowhererdquo or ldquowhatrdquo) assists the network to suppress irrelevant information from background (from ldquowhererdquo) or irrelevant object information (from ldquowhatrdquo), so as to give the required missing information (ldquowhererdquo or ldquowhatrdquo) in the motor output.","doi":"10.1109/DEVLRN.2008.4640806","startPage":"61","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"2008 7th IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2008.4640806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4640795","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636105/4640795/04640806.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Where-what network 1: \u201cWhere\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d assist each other through top-down connections","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640806/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Where-what network 1: \u201cWhere\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d assist each other through top-down connections","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4640806/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10367577","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Where-what network 1: \u201cWhere\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d assist each other through top-down connections","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICDL08_0011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048491S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636105","isNumber":"4640795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636105","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4640795","articleId":"4640806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4640833,"authors":[{"name":"Richard W.

However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in acquiring principle knowledge. We hypothesize that experience with equations that violate a to-be-learned principle will lead to changes in equation encoding, which in turn will promote acquisition of principle knowledge. Adultspsila knowledge of an arithmetic principle was evaluated before and after a training session in which some participants were exposed to equations that violated the principle. Participants who were exposed to temporally proximal principle violations increased their knowledge more than participants who were exposed to widely spaced violations. Learners with low principle knowledge post-training were also poor at encoding key features of the equations. Thus, variations in experience lead to variations in principle learning, and encoding is an important component of principle knowledge.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640833/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10367603","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4640833/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Implicit learning of arithmetic principles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implicit learning of arithmetic principles","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICDL08_0039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073175S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636105","isNumber":"4640795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636105","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4640795","articleId":"4640833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4640874,"authors":[{"name":"Amardeep Sathyanarayana","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Amardeep","lastName":"Sathyanarayana","id":"37542899200"},{"name":"Pinar Boyraz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Pinar","lastName":"Boyraz","id":"37398876800"},{"name":"John H.L.

The first approach considers isolated maneuver recognition with model concatenation to construct a generic route (bottom-to-top), whereas the second approach models the entire route as a dasiaphrasepsila and refines the HMM to discover maneuvers and parses the route using finer discovered maneuvers (top-to-bottom). By applying these two approaches, a hierarchical framework to model driver behavior signals is proposed. It is believed that using the proposed approach, driver identification and distraction detection problems can be addressed in a more systematic and mathematically sound manner. We believe that this framework and the initial results will encourage more investigations into driver behavior signal analysis and related safety systems employing a partitioned sub-module strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICVES.2008.4640874","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636761/4640848/04640874.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVES.2008.4640874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4640848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driver behavior analysis and route recognition by Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4640874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640874/","displayDocTitle":"Driver behavior analysis and route recognition by Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367685","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4640874/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver behavior analysis and route recognition by Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"0027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051336S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636761","isNumber":"4640848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636761","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4640848","articleId":"4640874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4640876,"authors":[{"name":"Amardeep Sathyanarayana","affiliation":["Center for Robust Speech Systems (CRSS), University of Technology, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Amardeep","lastName":"Sathyanarayana","id":"37542899200"},{"name":"Sandhya Nageswaren","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Technology, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Sandhya","lastName":"Nageswaren","id":"37688994000"},{"name":"Hassan Ghasemzadeh","affiliation":["Embedded systems and Signal Processing Laboratory (ESSP), University of Technology, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Ghasemzadeh","id":"37408717400"},{"name":"Roozbeh Jafari","affiliation":["Embedded systems and Signal Processing Laboratory (ESSP), University of Technology, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Roozbeh","lastName":"Jafari","id":"37279246000"},{"name":"John H.L.

In such a fast paced mode of transport, there are a variety of ways in which drivers can get distracted while driving. Getting stuck in a traffic jam, doing other tasks simultaneously while driving- for example drinking, reading, talking over the mobile phone are various forms of distractions. Early detection of driver distraction can reduce the number of accidents. This paper describes the initial analysis of a system for detecting driver distractions using data from the controller area network (CAN) and motion sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope). The paper mainly focuses on distractions perceivable with leg and head movements of the driver. The data from these expressive parts of the driver yield a high accuracy of distraction detection of over 90%. With such high accuracies, reliable systems could be built to have early warning or corrective mechanisms which would avoid or reduce the intensity of accidents caused due to driver distractions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4640848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVES.2008.4640876","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636761/4640848/04640876.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"125","doi":"10.1109/ICVES.2008.4640876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Body sensor networks for driver distraction identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Body sensor networks for driver distraction identification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4640876/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367687","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640876/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Body sensor networks for driver distraction identification","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"0029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044848S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636761","isNumber":"4640848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636761","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4640848","articleId":"4640876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":4640884,"authors":[{"name":"Kyohei Masui","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kyohei","lastName":"Masui","id":"37701740900"},{"name":"Makoto Itami","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Itami","id":"37284644000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2359-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2360-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4640884","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"abstract":"In inter-vehicle communication(IVC), many studies are focused on DS/SS CDMA(direct sequence / spread spectrum, code division multiple access) scheme.

Also, iterative channel estimation over multiple frames to estimate the desired user's channels provides additional gain.

Numerical simulations of the transmission performance of the AMOOFDM-SCM modems are undertaken in single-channel, optical amplifier-free, worst-case multimode fibre (MMF) links using intensity modulation and direct detection. It is shown that, based on practically available RF components, at least 64 Gb/s over 500 m and 37 Gb/s over 1000 m AMOOFDMSCM signal transmission is feasible in the aforementioned MMF links having 3-dB bandwidths as small as 292.5 MHz.km. In addition, when compared against the AMOOFDM technique, for achieving a required signal transmission capacity, AMOOFDMSCM also reveals significantly relaxed requirements on key component parameters, improved flexibility and robustness and more efficient use of MMF link spectral properties.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2008.080930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4640924/04640955.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2008.080930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4640924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Performance of Adaptively Modulated Optical OFDM Modems Using Subcarrier Modulation over Worst-Case Multimode Fibre Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4640955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4640955/","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Performance of Adaptively Modulated Optical OFDM Modems Using Subcarrier Modulation over Worst-Case Multimode Fibre Links","volume":"12","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251637","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4640955/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Performance of Adaptively Modulated Optical OFDM Modems Using Subcarrier Modulation over Worst-Case Multimode Fibre Links","sourcePdf":"cl_0810_788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052759S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4640924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4640924","articleId":"4640955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":4640962,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Rinner","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4663199/4640962/4640962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bernhard Rinner (Senior Member, IEEE) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in telematics from Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria, in 1993 and 1996, respectively.","He is a full Professor and Chair for Pervasive Computing at Klagenfurt University, Klagenfurt, Austria, where he is currently serving as Vice Dean of the Faculty of Technical Sciences.

Classical techniques for optimizing multi-objective designs are limited when numerous nonlinear behaviors are implied, generating a rise in costs both in computational time and resources. For this reason alternative techniques applying fuzzy logic have been developed for optimizing multi-objective designs of electronic circuits, in particular the Gaussian-like method is an approach widely used for several authors. This paper explains the equivalence of a Mamdani approximation in relation with a Gaussian-like system for performing the control actions of the optimization task, the equivalence is based on a simple functional relation among the parameters of both methods. Two examples in the optimization of active circuits are presented.","doi":"10.1109/CERMA.2008.26","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"2008 Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA '08)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CERMA.2008.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641028","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA '08)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641027/4641028/04641049.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalence between Gaussian-Like and Mamdani Fuzzy Methods in the Multi-objective Design of Electronic Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641049/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Equivalence between Gaussian-Like and Mamdani Fuzzy Methods in the Multi-objective Design of Electronic Circuits","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641049/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10367833","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2008-Oct. 3 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalence between Gaussian-Like and Mamdani Fuzzy Methods in the Multi-objective Design of Electronic Circuits","confLoc":"Cuernavaca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3320a068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13822S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2008-Oct. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641027","isNumber":"4641028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641027","xplore-issue":"4641028","articleId":"4641049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641099,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Sandoval G\u00edo","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica y Electr\u00f3nica, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida, Mexico"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas Sandoval","lastName":"G\u00edo","id":"37087668587"},{"name":"Juli\u00e1n Salt Llobregat","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Autom\u00e1tica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Juli\u00e1n Salt","lastName":"Llobregat","id":"37688197300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3320-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4641099","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"abstract":"It has been observed that the inclusion of Dual-Rate regulators in a sampled-data control loop occasionally\u00a0\u00a0introduces the phenomenon of intersample ripple in the output of the process being controlled.

First, we show how the elements of a single neuron: multipliers, sum of products and transfer function are separated and constructed as VHDL entities. These entities are then interconnected to form a neuron that can be mapped to a hardware device. Using a similar approach, neurons are grouped in layers, which are then interconnected themselves to construct an Artificial Neural Network. The methodology is intended to lead a Neural Network designer through the steps required to take the design into a hardware device, starting with the results provided by a neurosimulator, obtaining the network parameters and translating them into a fully synthesizable design. A prototype of a Java-based ANN descriptor to VHDL translator is presented. In addition, the desired characteristics of neurosimulators are discussed and a comparison among different hardware platforms is shown.","doi":"10.1109/CERMA.2008.54","startPage":"422","endPage":"427","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA '08)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641027/4641028/04641108.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA '08)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CERMA.2008.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology for Implementation of the Execution Phase of Artificial Neural Networks in Digital Hardware Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Hardware","Neurons","Generators","Transfer functions","Hardware design languages","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware description languages","Java","neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital hardware devices","artificial neural networks","single neuron","neurosimulator","VHDL translator","transfer functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Networks","Hardware Implementation","Methodology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2008-Oct. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology for Implementation of the Execution Phase of Artificial Neural Networks in Digital Hardware Devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641108/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367892","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology for Implementation of the Execution Phase of Artificial Neural Networks in Digital Hardware Devices","confLoc":"Cuernavaca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3320a422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064683S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2008-Oct. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641027","isNumber":"4641028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641027","xplore-issue":"4641028","articleId":"4641108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4641110,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Alarc\u00f3n-Paredes","affiliation":["Center for Comput.

Applications such as beamforming require mass computing capability on a single chip as well as flexibility to adapt to new algorithms. A reconfigurable IC with many processing tiles based on the Network-on-Chip architecture is considered ideal for such applications as it balances efficiency and flexibility. Due to the highly regular arrangement of the processing tiles connected by the communication network, it is possible to adopt new Design-for-X strategies to improve the dependability of the reconfigurable IC. The communication network can be reused as a test-access mechanism. On-chip deterministic test pattern generators can multicast test-vectors through the network to the cores under test and test responses from multiple cores can be collected and analyzed by a test result evaluator. The faulty core, or functional parts of it, will be labeled and isolated from the whole system by re-mapping the computing resources and thus improve the dependability of the whole system.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2008.24","startPage":"45","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641156.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Built-In Self-Diagnostics for a NoC-Based Reconfigurable IC for Dependable Beamforming Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641156/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Built-In Self-Diagnostics for a NoC-Based Reconfigurable IC for Dependable Beamforming Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641156/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10367926","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Built-In Self-Diagnostics for a NoC-Based Reconfigurable IC for Dependable Beamforming Applications","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"3365a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041867S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641141","isNumber":"4641142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641141","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4641142","articleId":"4641156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4641161,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiao Wang","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Connecticut, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407482200"},{"name":"Hassan Salmani","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Connecticut, USA"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Salmani","id":"37702285600"},{"name":"Mohammad Tehranipoor","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Connecticut, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Tehranipoor","id":"37293853000"},{"name":"Jim Plusquellic","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Plusquellic","id":"37330239000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3365-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"4641161","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":136,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1711},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641161","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Semiconductor device measurement","Current measurement","Hardware","Integrated circuits","Power measurement","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit manufacture","network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware Trojan detection","current integration","localized current analysis","integrated circuits security","IC fabrication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware Trojan","Authentication","hardware security and trust","Charge integration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DFT.2008.61","endPage":"95","startPage":"87","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641161.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Trojan Detection and Isolation Using Current Integration and Localized Current Analysis","abstract":"This paper addresses a new threat to the security of integrated circuits (ICs).

In this paper, we propose a current integration methodology to observe Trojan activity in the circuit and a localized current analysis approach to isolate the Trojan. Our simulation results considering process variations show that with a very small number of clock cycles the method can detect hardware Trojans as small as few gates without fully activating them.

The susceptibility further increases as the voltage is scaled down to save energy. Based on analysis on cells from commercial libraries, we have quantified the increase in the soft error probability across 65 nm and 45 nm technology nodes at different supply voltages using the Qcrit based simulation methodology. The Qcrit for both bit cells and latches decreases by ~30% as the designs are scaled from 65 nm to 45 nm. This decrease is expected to continue with further technology scaling as well. The results show that at nominal voltage, the Qcrit for a latch is just ~20% more than that of the bit cell in sub-65nm technology nodes. Further, as the voltage is scaled from 1 V to 0.4 V, Qcrit decreases by ~5X which substantially increases the probability of an upset if a particle strike happens. This work shows that in sub-65 nm technology nodes with aggressive voltage scaling, it is equally critical to solve the soft error problems in logic (latches, flip-flops) as it is in SRAMs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","startPage":"114","endPage":"122","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641164.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Technology and Voltage Scaling on the Soft Error Susceptibility in Nanoscale CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641164/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Technology and Voltage Scaling on the Soft Error Susceptibility in Nanoscale CMOS","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367933","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Technology and Voltage Scaling on the Soft Error Susceptibility in Nanoscale CMOS","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"3365a114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042385S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641141","isNumber":"4641142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641141","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"4641142","articleId":"4641164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4641168,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The paper provides a comprehensive examination of one alternative, quadded gate, inter-leaved node logic design. Quadded DfT circuitry is compared to circuitry with no fault tolerance in terms of area, power and performance. Ever shrinking device sizes are challenging the reliability limits and testing capabilities of a modern day integrated circuit (IC). Parametric variations, higher gate counts and lower pin counts render fault avoidance techniques ineffective and make fault detection an engineering challenge. Higher defect rates and Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI) will require bigger and complex DfT circuitry. This will result in more chips being rejected due to DfT failures.

Also, crosstalk noise has emerged as a serious problem in recent years, because more and more devices and wires have been packed on electronic chips. Despite being more immune to crosstalk noise than their ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) counterparts, the dense interconnected structures of FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) invite more vulnerabilities to crosstalk noise. Due to the lack of electrical detail concerning FPGA devices it is quite difficult to test the faults caused by crosstalk noise. This paper proposes a new approach for detecting effects such as glitches and delays in transition due to crosstalk noise in FPGAs. This approach is similar to the BIST (built-in self test) technique in that it incorporates the test pattern generator to generate the test vectors and the analyzer to analyze the crosstalk faults without any extra overhead for testing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A BIST Technique for Crosstalk Noise Detection in FPGAs","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2008.14","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641170.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A BIST Technique for Crosstalk Noise Detection in FPGAs","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641170/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367938","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BIST Technique for Crosstalk Noise Detection in FPGAs","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"3365a167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054382S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641141","isNumber":"4641142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641141","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4641142","articleId":"4641170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641174,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Regazzoni","affiliation":["ALaRI, University of Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Regazzoni","id":"37391916900"},{"name":"Thomas Eisenbarth","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT Security, RUB, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Eisenbarth","id":"38230880700"},{"name":"Luca Breveglieri","affiliation":["DEI-Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Breveglieri","id":"37274197700"},{"name":"Paolo Ienne","affiliation":["IC-EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Ienne","id":"37271141000"},{"name":"Israel Koren","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Koren","id":"37274556400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3365-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"4641174","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641174","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Integrated circuit modeling","Circuit faults","Correlation","Algorithm design and analysis","Data models","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic device","side-channel attack","fault injection attack","AES S-Box","error detection circuitry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Fault Attacks","Power Analysis Attacks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DFT.2008.53","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641174.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Can Knowledge Regarding the Presence of Countermeasures Against Fault Attacks Simplify Power Attacks on Cryptographic Devices?","abstract":"Side-channel attacks are nowadays a serious concern when implementing cryptographic algorithms. Powerful ways for gaining information about the secret key as well as various counter-measures against such attacks have been recently developed. Although it is well known that such attacks can exploit information leaked from different sources, most prior works have only addressed the problem of protecting a cryptographic device against a single type of attack. Consequently, there is very little knowledge on how a scheme for protecting a device against one type of side-channel attack may affect its vulnerability to other types of side-channel attacks. In this paper we focus on devices that include protection against fault injection attacks (using different error detection schemes) and explore whether the presence of such fault detection circuits affects the resistance against attacks based on power analysis. Using the AES S-Box as an example, we performed attacks on the unprotected implementation as well as modified implementations with parity check circuits or residue check circuits (mod3 and mod7). In particular, we focus on the question whether the knowledge of the presence of error detection circuitry in the cryptographic device can help an attacker who attempts to mount a power attack on the device. Our results show that the presence of error detection circuitry helps the attacker even if he is unaware of this circuitry, and that the benefit to the attacker increases with the number of check bits used for the purpose of error detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641174/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10367942","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Can Knowledge Regarding the Presence of Countermeasures Against Fault Attacks Simplify Power Attacks on Cryptographic Devices?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can Knowledge Regarding the Presence of Countermeasures Against Fault Attacks Simplify Power Attacks on Cryptographic Devices?","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"3365a202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085037S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641141","isNumber":"4641142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641141","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4641142","articleId":"4641174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641180,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Sun","affiliation":["Xi''an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596251500"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Xi''an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Nanning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37271536700"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3365-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"4641180","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Decoding","Silicon","Built-in self-test","Benchmark testing","Random access memory","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","CMOS memory circuits","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L2 cache defect tolerance","multibit error-correcting code","continuous CMOS technology scaling","defect density","cache memory defect tolerance strategies","L2 cache core","fully associative caches","multibit ECC check bits","selective multibit ECC protection","multibit ECC code word","L2 cache access latency","SimpleScalar tools","Cacti tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault tolerance","defect","cache","error correction code"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a design solution that enables the use of powerful multi-bit error-correcting code (ECC) to realize L2 cache defect tolerance at minimal latency and silicon area cost. This work is motivated by the observation that the continuous CMOS Technology scaling may result in an increasing level defect density and make conventional cache memory defect tolerance strategies inadequate. The basic idea is to complement conventional L2 cache core with two separate fully associative caches, one stores multi-bit ECC check bits for realizing area-efficient selective multi-bit ECC protection and another one stores the most recently decoded multi-bit ECC code word to minimize the impact of explicit multi-bit ECC decoding on L2 cache access latency. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated using SimpleScalar and Cacti tools. At the defect density of 0.5%, this design approach can maintain almost the same instruction per cycle (IPC) performance over a wide spectrum of benchmarks compared with ideal L2 cache without defects, while only incurring less than 2.5% of silicon area overhead.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2008.16","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641180.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realization of L2 Cache Defect Tolerance Using Multi-bit ECC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Realization of L2 Cache Defect Tolerance Using Multi-bit ECC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641180/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10367948","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641180/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of L2 Cache Defect Tolerance Using Multi-bit ECC","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"3365a254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058141S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641141","isNumber":"4641142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641141","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4641142","articleId":"4641180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641181,"authors":[{"name":"Ilia Polian","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Group Institute for Computer Science, Albert Ludwig University, Freiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ilia","lastName":"Polian","id":"37273423400"},{"name":"Wenjing Rao","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Rao","id":"37427902200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3365-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"4641181","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"abstract":"Nanoelectronic components are expected to suffer from very high error rates, implying the need for hardening techniques. We propose a fine-grained approach to harden a promising class of nanoelectronic circuits, called NanoPLAs, against errors. An analytical procedure and simulations are both incorporated into the algorithm to identify the most critical error locations. By targeting errors with the largest impact for a given circuit, the method can provide significant reliability boost at low cost. Furthermore, the method yields a plethora of alternative designs, trading off hardening costs against circuit robustness. In many cases, solutions found achieve both lower cost and higher robustness compared with the duplication-based hardening strategy introduced before.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641181.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2008.26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective Hardening of NanoPLA Circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Error analysis","CMOS integrated circuits","Robustness","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error detection","fault tolerance","nanoelectronics","programmable logic arrays","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["selective hardening","NanoPLA circuits","nanoelectronic components","robust design","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NanoPLA circuits","robust design","selective hardening","fault tolerance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Selective Hardening of NanoPLA Circuits","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641181/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367949","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Hardening of NanoPLA Circuits","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"3365a263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078005S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641141","isNumber":"4641142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641141","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4641142","articleId":"4641181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641186,"authors":[{"name":"Jenny Leung","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada"],"firstName":"Jenny","lastName":"Leung","id":"37602976100"},{"name":"Glenn H.

While more defects were found in cameras exposed to high cosmic ray radiation environments, comparing the collective growth rate of different sensor types has shown that CCD imagers develop twice as many defects as APS imagers, indicating that CCD imagers may be more sensitive to radiation. The defect growth of individual imagers can be estimated by analyzing historical image sets captured by individual cameras. This paper presents a defect tracing algorithm, which determines the presence or absence of defects by accumulating Bayesian statistics collected over a sequence of images. Recognizing the complexity of image scenes, camera settings, and local clustering of defects in color images (due to demosaicing), refinements of the algorithm have been explored and the resulting detection accuracy has increased significantly. In-field test results from 3 imagers with a total of 26 defects have shown that 96% of the defects' dates were identified with less than 10 days difference compared to visual inspection. In addition to our continuous study of in-field defects in high-end digital SLRs, this paper presents a preliminary study of 10 cellphone cameras. Our test results address the comparison of defects types, distribution and growth found in low-end and high-end cameras with significantly different pixel sizes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641186.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"313","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2008.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Detection of In-field Defect Growth in Image Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Cameras","Sensors","Interpolation","Charge coupled devices","Color","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["appearance potential spectra","Bayes methods","CCD image sensors","image colour analysis","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic detection","in-field defect growth","digital image sensors","high cosmic ray radiation environments","APS imagers","CCD imagers","defect tracing algorithm","images. sequence","Bayesian statistics","image scenes","camera settings","local clustering","color images","high-end digital SLR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["APS","CCD","CMOS","defect detection","hot pixels. fault tolerant"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Detection of In-field Defect Growth in Image Sensors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641186/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367953","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Detection of In-field Defect Growth in Image Sensors","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"3365a305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084545S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641141","isNumber":"4641142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641141","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4641142","articleId":"4641186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641189,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiana Bolchini","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristiana","lastName":"Bolchini","id":"37273944700"},{"name":"Antonio Miele","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Miele","id":"37273951700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3365-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"4641189","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641189","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space exploration","Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit reliability","Reliability engineering","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Genetic algorithms","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design space exploration","SRAM","FPGA systems","single event upsets fault mitigation","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliable FPGA design","Design Space Exploration"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a design space exploration approach for the design of SRAM-based FPGAs with single event upsets fault mitigation capabilities, exploiting the feature of partial, dynamic reconfiguration offered by the target platform.

Unlike worst-case error correction coding (ECC), the proposed method is capable of selecting the most effective ECC scheme based on predicted link quality at runtime. Our method configures the ECC codec to obtain the desired error correction strength using a set of single-error correction (SEC) codes combined with interleaving. The method can effectively handle multi-cycle and adjacent multi-wire errors existing on switch-to-switch links. An experimental case study shows that the adaptive method can increase the energy-efficiency by up to 19% over a fixed ECC scheme, for a given residual flit error rate. Furthermore, energy reduction affected by different multi-wire and multi-cycle noise scenarios are compared.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2008.40","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641141/4641142/04641191.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2008.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Error Control for NoC Switch-to-Switch Links in a Variable Noise Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Error Control for NoC Switch-to-Switch Links in a Variable Noise Environment","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641191/","accessionNumber":"10367958","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Error Control for NoC Switch-to-Switch Links in a Variable Noise Environment","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"3365a352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065739S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641141","isNumber":"4641142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641141","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4641142","articleId":"4641191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641192,"authors":[{"name":"Osnat Keren","affiliation":["Bar-llan University, Israel"],"firstName":"Osnat","lastName":"Keren","id":"37371363900"},{"name":"Ilya Levin","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Levin","id":"37265555800"},{"name":"Vladimir Ostrovsky","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Ostrovsky","id":"37283896300"},{"name":"Beni Abramov","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Beni","lastName":"Abramov","id":"37698454700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3365-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"4641192","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Distance measurement","Encoding","Redundancy","Input variables","Combinational circuits","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational circuits","error detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary error detection","combinational circuits","partitioning","optimized sub-set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["error detection","on-line checking","combinational circuits","partitioning"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a new technique for designing a concurrently checking combinational circuit.

ASIC and FPGA implementations employ specific hardware structures to exploit parallelism in order to improve processing speed; however, optimizing resource usage requires the use of fixed-point arithmetic, thereby losing precision, and the final system is restricted to a particular network topology. This paper presents a mixed approach based on a multiprocessor system-on-chip (SoC) on a FPGA. The use of software-driven embedded microprocessors with custom floating-point extensions for ANN related functions allows for greater precision and flexibility in the structure of the networks to be trained with no need for device reconfiguration, and parallelism is achieved by the use of a large number of processing units. Design limitations are discussed, and preliminary results are presented on the performance of the system on an Altera DE2-70 development board.","doi":"10.1109/ENICS.2008.22","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advances in Electronics and Micro-electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advances in Electronics and Micro-electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641216/4641217/04641253.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ENICS.2008.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiprocessor SoC Implementation of Neural Network Training on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641253/","displayDocTitle":"Multiprocessor SoC Implementation of Neural Network Training on FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641253/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10368005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiprocessor SoC Implementation of Neural Network Training on FPGA","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"3370a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120812S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641216","isNumber":"4641217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4641217","articleId":"4641253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641291,"authors":[{"name":"David Benjamin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Benjamin","id":"37284893600"},{"name":"Mikhail J.

NoLA is designed as an 8times8 MIMO-OFDM system. NoLA transmits two lower rate streaming signals and six higher rate streaming signals through eight transmit antennas. After QR-decomposition of the received multi-rate signals, the lower rate streaming signals are decoded by multi-dimensional detector and removed by the successive interference cancellation scheme. The remaining six higher rate streaming signals are decoded using a weighted zero-forcing detector. Besides, NoLA adopts an independent LDPC coding scheme to process high-speed decoding at gigabit. In this paper, we propose an antenna permutation scheme for multi-rate MIMO systems with an independent LDPC coding scheme like NoLA. The simulation results show that the higher rate streaming signals achieve higher performance gain than the lower rate streaming signals by only a simple modification of the MIMO-OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/UBICOMM.2008.29","publicationTitle":"2008 The Second International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The Second International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641295/4641296/04641326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBICOMM.2008.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641296","startPage":"139","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Antenna Permutation for Multi-rate Gigabit MIMO-LDPC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Antenna Permutation for Multi-rate Gigabit MIMO-LDPC","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641326/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10368054","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641326/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Antenna Permutation for Multi-rate Gigabit MIMO-LDPC","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"3367a139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06967S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641295","isNumber":"4641296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641295","xplore-issue":"4641296","articleId":"4641326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641329,"authors":[{"name":"Yuro Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yuro","lastName":"Lee","id":"37697220400"},{"name":"Jaemin Ahn","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering and Information & Communication Engineering, Chungnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaemin","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37290861200"},{"name":"Sok-kyu Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sok-kyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281134600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3367-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4641329","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new MIMO receiver algorithm for 8x8 MIMO system based on hybrid detection to reduced computational complexity for Giga-bps data transmission. The proposed MIMO detector, multi-rate QR-MDD consists of MDD (multi-dimensional detector), DSC (decision symbol cancellation) and WZF (weighted zero forcing) where the transmit streams are divided into two groups. The first group is transmitted using lower modulation level and lower code rate and the MDD algorithms is used for demodulation and decoding, while the second group is transmitted using higher modulation order and higher code rate and the WZF algorithms is used. Once the first group is decoded, they are cancelled out form received signal for demodulation and decoding of the second group. The error performance is slightly worse performance than that of MLD (maximum likelihood detection). And computational complexity viewpoint of the required number of real multiplications is approximately 2 times the complexity level of WZF.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The Second International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4641295/4641296/04641329.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"2008 The Second International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies","doi":"10.1109/UBICOMM.2008.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBICOMM.2008.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New MIMO Algorithm for Gbps Transmission in Nomadic Local Wireless Access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Complexity theory","Antennas","Artificial neural networks","Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","decoding","demodulation","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","mobile radio","radio access networks","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gbps transmission","nomadic local wireless access","MIMO receiver algorithm","MIMO system","computational complexity","Giga-bps data transmission","MIMO detector","multirate QR-MDD","multidimensional detector","decision symbol cancellation","weighted zero forcing","lower modulation","demodulation","decoding","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New MIMO Algorithm for Gbps Transmission in Nomadic Local Wireless Access","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641329/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10368057","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New MIMO Algorithm for Gbps Transmission in Nomadic Local Wireless Access","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"3367a154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042937S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4641295","isNumber":"4641296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641295","xplore-issue":"4641296","articleId":"4641329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641423,"authors":[{"name":"Franjo Plavec","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Franjo","lastName":"Plavec","id":"37421613600"},{"name":"Zvonko Vranesic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Zvonko","lastName":"Vranesic","id":"37283995000"},{"name":"Stephen Brown","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Brown","id":"37274910200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2264-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2265-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2266-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4641423","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards compilation of streaming programs into FPGA hardware","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Forum on Specification, Verification and Design Languages","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636106/4641405/04641423.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"2008 Forum on Specification, Verification and Design Languages","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDL.2008.4641423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641405","doi":"10.1109/FDL.2008.4641423","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Software","Program processors","Throughput","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["streaming programs","FPGA hardware","Brook streaming language","source-to-source compiler","commercial C2H behavioral synthesis compiler"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641423","abstract":"There is an increasing need for automated conversion of high-level design descriptions into hardware.

This paper presents a model driven hardware design process that is dedicated to reactive embedded systems. The approach is based on the component language (COLA), a synchronous data flow language with formal semantics. COLA follows the hypothesis of perfect synchrony. Models thus do not assume specific timing properties and remain deterministic as long as data flow requirements are retained. This is an essential feature for modeling safety-critical systems. Further, the well-defined semantics not only allows that the resulting models can be formally reasoned about, but is also the key to translation to domain-specific languages. This paper describes the approach of translating the models to VHDL descriptions from their graphical representations. As COLA is well-adapted to both data flow description and control automata, the generated VHDL code can be synthesized to very efficient FPGA circuits, comparable to that synthesized from hand-written VHDL code according to our case study.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDL.2008.4641445","publicationTitle":"2008 Forum on Specification, Verification and Design Languages","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Forum on Specification, Verification and Design Languages","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636106/4641405/04641445.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","doi":"10.1109/FDL.2008.4641445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model driven development approach for implementing reactive systems in hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A model driven development approach for implementing reactive systems in hardware","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641445/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367646","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641445/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model driven development approach for implementing reactive systems in hardware","confLoc":"Stuttgart, Germany","sourcePdf":"UMES_3_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06476S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636106","isNumber":"4641405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636106","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4641405","articleId":"4641445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4641477,"authors":[{"name":"Selcuk Kose","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Selcuk","lastName":"Kose","id":"37543079700"},{"name":"Emre Salman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Salman","id":"37296015600"},{"name":"Zeljko Ignjatovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Zeljko","lastName":"Ignjatovic","id":"37270103900"},{"name":"Eby G.

An Altera Stratix III FPGA can compress a 56 megapixel image in hundreds of microseconds.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","High definition video","Transform coding","Transforms","Image color analysis","Pixel","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","field programmable gate arrays","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design methodolgy","HD photocompression algorithm","Altera Stratix III FPGA","images compresssion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641489","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2008.4641489","startPage":"105","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4632904/4641463/04641489.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2008.4641489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641489/","displayDocTitle":"Design methodolgy for HD Photo compression algorithm targeting a FPGA","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10367157","htmlLink":"/document/4641489/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design methodolgy for HD Photo compression algorithm targeting a FPGA","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064577S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4632904","isNumber":"4641463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4632904","xplore-issue":"4641463","articleId":"4641489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641491,"authors":[{"name":"Farshad Moradi","affiliation":["Nanoelectronic Group, Institute of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Moradi","id":"37408663500"},{"name":"Dag.T.

Power optimization techniques for bulk CMOS-based circuit designs have been extensively studied. As technology scales, FinFET has been proposed as an alternative for bulk CMOS when technology scales beyond 32 nm technology (E.J. Nowak et al., 2004). In this paper, we propose a power optimization framework for FinFET based circuit design, based on genetic algorithms. We exploit the unique feature of independent gate (IG) controls for FinFET devices to reduce the power consumption, and combine with other low power techniques such as multi-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dd</sub>\n and gate sizing to achieve power optimization for FinFET-based circuits. We use 32 nm PTM FinFET device model (W. Zhao and Y. Cao, 2006) and conduct experiments on ISCAS benchmarks.

Therefore, to operate cells in the subthreshold regime, new cell structures needs to be explored. Towards this, we present a single-ended I/O (SEIO) bit-line latch style 7-transistor static random access memory (SRAM) cell (7T-LSRAM) as an alternative for nanometer CMOS technology which can function in ultra-low voltage regime. Compared to existing 6-transistor (6T) cell or 10-transistor cell design, the proposed cell has 2X improved read stability and 36% better write-ability at lower supply voltage. Furthermore, the 7T-LSRAM has improved process variation tolerance. The area analysis shows that there is 18% increase in area penalty compared to the standard 6T cell, however the improved performance and process variation tolerance could justify the overhead.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2008.4641520","startPage":"243","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4632904/4641463/04641520.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2008.4641520","endPage":"246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A subthreshold single ended I/O SRAM cell design for nanometer CMOS technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A subthreshold single ended I/O SRAM cell design for nanometer CMOS technologies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641520/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10367188","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A subthreshold single ended I/O SRAM cell design for nanometer CMOS technologies","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037904S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4632904","isNumber":"4641463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4632904","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4641463","articleId":"4641520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641521,"authors":[{"name":"Young Bok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Young Bok Kim","id":"37688648400"},{"name":"Yong-Bin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Yong-Bin Kim","id":"37280923400"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2596-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2597-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"4641521","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":924},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Logic gates","FinFETs","Transistors","Threshold voltage","Writing","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","MOSFET","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power 8T SRAM","independent gate FinFET technology","cell design method","current control","device threshold voltage","minimum power consumption","static noise margin","leakage power","write delay","size 32 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641521","abstract":"In this paper, new SRAM cell design methods for FinFET technology are proposed. One of the most important features of FinFET is that the independent front and back gate can be biased differently to control the current and the device threshold voltage. By controlling the back gate of FinFET, SRAM cell can be designed for minimum power consumption. This paper proposes a new 8T (8 transistors) SRAM structure that reduces dynamic power in writing operation and provides wider SNM (static noise margin). Using the new FinFET based 8T SRAM cell, dynamic power consumption is reduced about 48% and the SNM is widened up to 56% compared to the conventional 6T SRAM at the expense of 2% leakage power and 3% write delay increase.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641463","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4632904/4641463/04641521.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2008.4641521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2008.4641521","startPage":"247","endPage":"250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power 8T SRAM using 32nm independent gate FinFET technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641521/","displayDocTitle":"Low power 8T SRAM using 32nm independent gate FinFET technology","htmlLink":"/document/4641521/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10367189","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power 8T SRAM using 32nm independent gate FinFET technology","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092196S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4632904","isNumber":"4641463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4632904","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4641463","articleId":"4641521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641522,"authors":[{"name":"Jawar Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Jawar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37397123000"},{"name":"Jimson Mathew","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Jimson","lastName":"Mathew","id":"37298481800"},{"name":"Dhiraj K.

Under an instantaneous transmit power constraint, vector perturbation precoding requires that the users be continuously informed about the adaptive power scaling factor used at the transmit side. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new precoding scheme that uses a fixed power scaling and avoids transmitting when the available power is not sufficient to perform channel equalization at the transmit side, an event referred to as outage. We present a performance analysis and optimization of this scheme and provide numerical comparisons with classical vector perturbation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641571.pdf","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit outage precodingwith imperfect channel state information under an instantaneous power constraint","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641571","startPage":"66","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transmit outage precodingwith imperfect channel state information under an instantaneous power constraint","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641571/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10367235","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641571/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit outage precodingwith imperfect channel state information under an instantaneous power constraint","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056307S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641572,"authors":[{"name":"Belkacem Mouhouche","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Belkacem","lastName":"Mouhouche","id":"37269250100"},{"name":"Cedric Artigue","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Cedric","lastName":"Artigue","id":"37701383000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641572","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Encoding","Interference","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","code division multiple access","least mean squares methods","matched filters","multiuser detection","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding strategy","code division multiple access","CDMA packet data network","reduced rank multiuser detection","automatic retransmission request","ARQ scheme","packet combining scheme","single user matched filter","minimum mean squared error receiver","MMSE method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reduced Rank MMSE Filtering","CDMA Packet Data Network","Coding Rate"]}],"abstract":"Reduced-rank code division multiple access (CDMA) multi-user detection has received a lot of attention recently. The output SINR provided by a reduced-rank receiver depends on the filter rank and is confined between the SINRs of the single user matched filter (SUMF) and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receiver. In packet CDMA data networks like HSDPA, the measure of performance is the throughput. Thus, previous results on reduced-rank MMSE receivers SINR cannot be used directly. In this paper, we study the throughput of CDMA data networks using reduced-rank MMSE receivers, automatic retransmission request (ARQ) and packet combining. We derive the expression of the system throughput as the function of the filter rank, the coding rate and the number of retransmissions. We present simulation results to highlight the behavior of the maximum throughput as a function of the filter rank and the coding rate. We then conclude on coding strategies to adopt depending on the signal to noise ratio and the receiver rank in order to maximize the system throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding strategies for CDMA packet data networks with reduced rank multiuser detection, ARQ and Packet Combining","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641572","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641572.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coding strategies for CDMA packet data networks with reduced rank multiuser detection, ARQ and Packet Combining","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641572/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367236","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding strategies for CDMA packet data networks with reduced rank multiuser detection, ARQ and Packet Combining","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055268S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641573,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael Hunger","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Hunger","id":"37285557900"},{"name":"David A.

Since all covariance matrices have to obey the property of being positive semidefinite, this characteristic has to be reflected in the constraint set. In addition, the sum of all traces of the covariance matrices shall be upper bounded. Using a preconditioned gradient descent algorithm, we derive an orthogonal projection onto this constraint set in an easy to follow monolithic way such that it directly results from the definition of the projection. Interestingly, this projection allows for a descriptive water-spilling interpretation in the style of the well-known water-filling algorithm. Two possible applications are investigated: the sum mean-square-error minimization and the weighted sum-rate maximization for the MIMO broadcast channel. Simulations finally reveal the excellent performance of the proposed framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641573.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general covariance-based optimization framework using orthogonal projections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Optimization","MIMO","Minimization","Signal processing algorithms","Downlink","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","covariance matrices","gradient methods","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general covariance-based optimization framework","orthogonal projections","covariance matrices","constraint set","preconditioned gradient descent algorithm","descriptive water-spilling interpretation","water-filling algorithm","sum mean-square-error minimization","weighted sum-rate maximization","MIMO broadcast channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A general covariance-based optimization framework using orthogonal projections","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641573/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367237","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general covariance-based optimization framework using orthogonal projections","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067238S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641575,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Maliatsos","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Maliatsos","id":"37294312000"},{"name":"Athanassios Adamis","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanassios","lastName":"Adamis","id":"37064389700"},{"name":"Philip Constantinou","affiliation":["National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Constantinou","id":"37273139800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641575","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Filter bank","Receivers","Frequency estimation","Finite impulse response filter","Filtering","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","mobile radio","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver design","subband carrier allocation strategy","OFDMA-based system","synchronization errors","uplink transmission","intolerable multiple access interference","mobile users","carrier offsets","Doppler shifts","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["frequency synchronization and correction","OFDMA","polyphase filters"]}],"abstract":"Time and frequency offsets can cause severe degradation in the performance of any OFDM-based System. Therefore synchronization procedures are necessary for the proper function of a receiver. In OFDMA, where different users share the available subcarriers, synchronization becomes an arduous task. Synchronization errors as far as the uplink transmission is concerned may cause intolerable Multiple Access Interference (MAI) as the signals are produced by different mobile users and propagate through different channels with various Carrier Offsets and Doppler shifts. The receiver must estimate a number of parameters and compensate for the produced intercarrier (ICI) and intersymbol (ISI) interference. These tasks cause massive increase of the computational workload required by the receiver. However, with the use of proper filtering and multirate processing the receiver complexity can be contained with no significant performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641575","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641575.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient receiver design for OFDMA Systems with subband carrier allocation strategy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641575/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient receiver design for OFDMA Systems with subband carrier allocation strategy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367239","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641575/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient receiver design for OFDMA Systems with subband carrier allocation strategy","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569103988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062447S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641579,"authors":[{"name":"Ayman Alsawah","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS, ENSEA, Universite de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Alsawah","id":"37688422300"},{"name":"Inbar Fijalkow","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS, ENSEA, Universite de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Inbar","lastName":"Fijalkow","id":"37269104600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641579","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Distance measurement","Modulation","OFDM","Bit error rate","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fair service provision","OFDMA","partial channel-state information","resource allocation","QoS","minimum user data rate","bit-error rate","maximum outage probability"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of resource allocation on an OFDMA downlink under fairness constraints with limited channel state information (CSI).

Despite their relevance, these two systems have only been simultaneously studied employing finite user population models and considering perfect detection of the active users, which are assumptions only useful in scenarios with low numbers of users and high values of the SNR. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an infinite user population model, valid for scenarios with large numbers of users and finite traffic loads, which allows us to extend the available results on ALOHA MPR protocols to systems that use retransmission diversity (RD). Unlike existing approaches our model includes both the effects of packet decoding errors and the effects of imperfect detection of the active users, which considerably affect the performance of conventional NDMA systems in finite SNR environments. Additionally, the proposed model provides a better approximation to the queuing delay of NDMA protocols than the conventional formula of an M/G/1 queue with vacations. Finally, the proposed algorithm also represents an extension and generalization of contention binary tree algorithms assisted by signal processing tools such as SICTA (successive interference cancellation tree algorithm) and other algorithms assisted by source separation. The benefits of the proposed model are assessed using simulation and analytic results.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641580","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641580.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An infinite user model for random access protocols assisted by multipacket reception and retransmission diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An infinite user model for random access protocols assisted by multipacket reception and retransmission diversity","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641580/","accessionNumber":"10367244","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641580/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An infinite user model for random access protocols assisted by multipacket reception and retransmission diversity","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050819S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641581,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassan M.

This algorithm compares with the iterative decoding of codes defined on graphs [1], in that it propagates in the trellises of the turbo code by removing transitions in the same way edges are removed in a bipartite graph under message-passing decoding. Performance comparison with LDPC codes for different coding rates is shown.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Decoding","Parity check codes","Encoding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Convolutional codes","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction","iterative decoding","message passing","parity check codes","trellis codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum-delay decoding","upper-layer FEC","parallel turbo codes","on-the-fly decoding","iterative decoding","trellis codes","bipartite graph","message-passing decoding","LDPC codes","forward error correction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641581","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641581.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum-delay decoding of turbo codes for upper-layer FEC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimum-delay decoding of turbo codes for upper-layer FEC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641581/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641581/","accessionNumber":"10367245","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum-delay decoding of turbo codes for upper-layer FEC","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569099807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0456S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641582,"authors":[{"name":"Vagner Vale do Nascimento","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Vagner Vale","lastName":"do Nascimento","id":"38185490700"},{"name":"Jaime Portugheis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Portugheis","id":"37299825800"},{"name":"Daniel Carvalho da Cunha","affiliation":["Polytechnical School, University of Pernambuco (UPE), Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel Carvalho","lastName":"da Cunha","id":"37549775400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641582","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"This paper presents a study about q-ary product turbo codes applied to FFH-CDMA systems.

The goal of this paper is to show that any pilot based scheme that is able to induce a Toeplitz structure in the channel correlation matrix, can make use of an existing class of so-called superfast algorithms for Toeplitz inverses which are specially suitable to pilot-based estimators. The key point behind such observation is that the required Toeplitz inverse inherent to common minimum mean-square error (MMSE) or least-squares (LS) criteria can not only be performed offline, but efficiently implemented via efficient FFT techniques. The most significant consequence of this fact is that, given a structure for the vector of pilots and an upper bound for the channel delay spread, say N, it is only necessary to store 2N coefficients per pilot structure in order to recover the entire channel. This is particularly useful in turbo equalization scenarios and DVB applications, especially for sparse channels. We shall illustrate the idea via a zero-padded (ZP) and standard cyclic prefix based block transmission schemes.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641586.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"145","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of superfast algorithms to pilot-based channel estimation schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of superfast algorithms to pilot-based channel estimation schemes","htmlLink":"/document/4641586/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10367250","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of superfast algorithms to pilot-based channel estimation schemes","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569096447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062804S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641587,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Venkateswaran","affiliation":["Faculty EEMCS, Technical University Delft, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Venkateswaran","id":"37397469800"},{"name":"Alle-Jan van der Veen","affiliation":["Faculty EEMCS, Technical University Delft, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Alle-Jan","lastName":"van der Veen","id":"37069583400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641587","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neodymium","Antennas","Arrays","Receivers","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial beamforming","ADC power consumption","antenna array systems","analog to digital convertors","analog preprocessing network","power consumption reduction","narrowband channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog beamforming","reduced rank processing","cross-spectral projections","passive weighing structures"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial beamforming to reduce ADC power consumption in antenna array systems","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641587","startPage":"146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641587","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a receiver setup with fewer analog to digital convertors (ADCpsilas) than antennas.

The precoder design based on the channel state information (CSI) can process the transmitting symbol before transmission. However, the spatial multiplexing is still sensitive to the ill-conditioning of the channel matrix. The conventional beam directions in the precoder are designed via singular value decomposition (SVD) which diagonalize the MIMO channel matrix H into eigenmodes. In this paper, we present a different approach using LU decomposition (LUD) to obtain the beam directions. We show that the LUD yields better channel condition and hence better error performance. The LUD-based precoder also has less feedback channel bandwidth requirement and lower complexity than the conventional SVD-based precoder.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641589.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity channel decomposition for spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Decoding","Receivers","Fading","Complexity theory","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity channel decomposition","spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","multiple-input multiple-output","independent information streams","channel state information","channel matrix","singular value decomposition","MIMO channel matrix","LU decomposition","channel bandwidth requirement","SVD-based precoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Precoder","Spatial Multiplexing","SVD","Channel Decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity channel decomposition for spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641589/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367253","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity channel decomposition for spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569101559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067535S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4641590,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben de Francisco","affiliation":["Eur\u00e9com Institute, La Valbonne, France"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"de Francisco","id":"37294312700"},{"name":"Claude Simon","affiliation":["Faculty EEMCS, Technical University Delft, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Simon","id":"38557846900"},{"name":"Dirk T.M.

A design criterion that effectively exploits the cell statistics is proposed, based on minimizing the average sum-rate distortion in a system with joint linear beamforming and multiuser scheduling. The proposed average distortion function is optimized by generating a set of quantization codebooks through random trials, keeping the codebook that yields the lowest distortion. Comparisons with limited feedback approaches relying on random codebooks are provided, highlighting the importance of matching the codebook design to the cell statistics. Numerical results show a performance gain in scenarios with non-uniform user distributions. Further, we propose a scheme that exploits the limited channel knowledge at the base station to reduce the computational complexity of determining the beamforming vectors and of finding the optimal user set.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641590","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641590.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming for correlated broadcast channels with quantized channel state information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641590/","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming for correlated broadcast channels with quantized channel state information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367254","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641590/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming for correlated broadcast channels with quantized channel state information","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063004S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641591,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Fertl","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Fertl","id":"37294258000"},{"name":"Joakim Jalden","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Jalden","id":"37284731500"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641591","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation","Complexity theory","Decoding","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","decoding","demodulation","error statistics","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","modulation coding","parity check codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent modulation channel capacity","MIMO-BICM demodulators","multiple-input multiple-output demodulators","bit-interleaved coded modulation","noniterative demodulation","noniterative decoding","bit error rate simulations","low-density parity-check codes"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides a performance comparison of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) demodulators for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems with non-iterative demodulation and decoding.

In this paper, we alleviate this assumption by assuming uniformly distributed UTs. The model under investigation is a Gaussian cellular multiple access channel (GCMAC) over a planar cellular array in the presence of power-law path loss and flat fading. In this context, we evaluate the effect of UT distribution on the optimal sum-rate capacity by considering a variable-density cellular system. Furthermore, we compare the sum-rate capacity produced by the planar and the linear cellular array. Finally, the analytical results are interpreted in the context of a typical macrocellular scenario.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line matrix methods","Distance measurement","Mathematical model","Arrays","Fading","Interference","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Gaussian processes","information theory","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal information theoretic capacity","planar cellular uplink channel","information-theoretic hyper-receiver cellular models","user terminals","tractable mathematical models","Gaussian cellular multiple access channel","planar cellular array","power-law path loss","flat fading","optimal sum-rate capacity","variable-density cellular system","linear cellular array"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641597","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641597.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal information theoretic capacity of the planar cellular uplink channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal information theoretic capacity of the planar cellular uplink channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641597/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641597/","accessionNumber":"10367261","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal information theoretic capacity of the planar cellular uplink channel","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569103999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086583S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641598,"authors":[{"name":"Markus G.

Furthermore, in order to avoid frequency planning, a frequency reuse factor of one is desirable. In this case, system capacity is limited by interference, which is particularly crucial for mobile terminals with a single receive antenna. For a high throughput, interference cancellation algorithms are required in the receiver. In this paper, a single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) algorithm is introduced for amplitude-shift keying (ASK) modulation schemes used in coded OFDM transmission which achieves high gains in comparison to a conventional coded OFDM transmission employing quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) in an interference limited scenario. Furthermore, an adaptive least-mean-square (LMS) and a recursive least-squares (RLS) SAIC receiver, respectively, are presented. We show that in particular the RLS solution enables a good tradeoff between performance and complexity and is robust even to multiple interferers and frequency synchronization errors.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641598","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641598.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM transmission with single antenna interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641598/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM transmission with single antenna interference cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367262","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641598/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM transmission with single antenna interference cancellation","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569096673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060807S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641600,"authors":[{"name":"Joakim Jalden","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Jalden","id":"37284731500"},{"name":"Johannes Maurer","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Maurer","id":"37285341000"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641600","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Interference","Transmitters","Noise","MIMO","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity order","vector perturbation precoding","imperfect channel state information","quasistatic MIMO channel","long-term power constraints effect","short-term power constraints effect","power allocation","error probability"]}],"abstract":"We consider vector perturbation precoding over a quasi-static MIMO channel under the assumption of imperfect channel state information (CSI).

This kind of nonlinear models has important applications in the field of telecommunications, e.g. to model uplink channels in Radio Over Fiber multiuser communication systems. The proposed technique is based on the decomposition of a tensor composed of covariances of the chip-rate sampled received signals, the transmitted signals being assumed to be Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulated. The considered tensor-based approach allows a great flexibility on the number of antennas and the spreading factor, which is particularly desirable when identifying nonlinear systems. Two blind channel estimation algorithms are considered: the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm and a non-iterative algorithm based on Eigenvalue Decompositions (EVD). The performance of the proposed estimation algorithms is illustrated by means of computer simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind estimation of nonlinear instantaneous channels in multiuser CDMA systems with PSK inputs","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641602","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641602.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind estimation of nonlinear instantaneous channels in multiuser CDMA systems with PSK inputs","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641602/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367266","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind estimation of nonlinear instantaneous channels in multiuser CDMA systems with PSK inputs","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086505S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641607,"authors":[{"name":"Man-On Pun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Man-On Pun","id":"37296526500"},{"name":"D.

In contrast to conventional collaborative beamforming schemes in which each source node uses channel state information to correct its local carrier offset and channel phase, the proposed beamforming scheme opportunistically selects a subset of source nodes whose received signals combine in a quasi-coherent manner at the intended receiver. No local phase-precompensation is performed by the nodes in the opportunistic collaborative beamformer. As a result, each node requires only one bit of feedback from the destination in order to determine if it should or should not participate in the collaborative beamformer. Analytical results show that the received signal power obtained with the proposed beamforming scheme scales linearly with the number of available source nodes. Since the optimal node selection rule requires an exhaustive search over all possible subsets of source nodes, two low-complexity selection algorithms are developed. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of opportunistic collaborative beamforming with the low-complexity selection algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641607/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10367271","publicationDate":"July 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641607/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic collaborative beamforming with one-bit feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic collaborative beamforming with one-bit feedback","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054952S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641611,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Philippe Javaudin","affiliation":["Research & Development Division, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Javaudin","id":"37293776600"},{"name":"Yiqi Jiang","affiliation":["Centre \u010fAffaires Alphasis, Altran, Saint Gregoire, France"],"lastName":"Yiqi Jiang","id":"37695290200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641611","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"abstract":"Multi-carrier modulations such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are widely used in radio transmission systems. Among these modulations, OFDM/OQAM is an interesting alternative to the conventional cyclic-prefix, OFDM (CP-OFDM) modulation, as it does not require the use of any guard interval. This specificity allows a better spectral efficiency. In this paper we investigate on channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM modulations in the case of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions over radio channels. We focus on a two transmit antenna spatial data multiplexing (SDM) scheme and on the use of scattered pilots for the channel estimation. We propose a MIMO channel estimation method that copes with the intrinsic interference inherent to OFDM/OQAM and we compare this method to ideal channel estimation methods proposed in previous studies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641611.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation in MIMO OFDM/OQAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","MIMO","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Time frequency analysis","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","radio transmission systems","quadrature amplitude modulation","spectral efficiency","guard interval","multiple-input multiple-output transmissions","spatial data multiplexing","transmit antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","OQAM","MIMO","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation in MIMO OFDM/OQAM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367275","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation in MIMO OFDM/OQAM","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569095877.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03704S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4641612,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This choice of state vector leads to a nonlinear observation equation and hence to the use of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the states variables.

This scheme only requires partial channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) in terms of the equivalent channel moduli. This paper deals with the problem of feeding back the CSI from the multiple receivers to the base station (BS) transmitter through limited capacity feedback links. This involves a quantization and a delay that produces errors in the CSIT. In this sense, the proposed scheme in this paper is based on a robust design that takes into account these errors. Additionally, a dynamic bit allocation in the feedback among the users is derived, and combined with differential quantization to minimize the transmit power. It considers both the userspsila sensitivities to the quantization errors and the Doppler frequencies due to the mobility. Simulation results show the benefits from using such schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10383545","htmlLink":"/document/4641619/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic bit allocation and differential quantization in feedback link for robust power allocation in multiuser opportunistic beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic bit allocation and differential quantization in feedback link for robust power allocation in multiuser opportunistic beamforming","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066988S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4641620,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Deng","id":"37538736200"},{"name":"Alister G.

The receiver of DOSM does not require estimation of channel fading coefficients, channel power, signal power, or noise power to decode the data symbols and the decision is based on the two consecutively received codewords. A constellation rotation strategy is introduced to enhance the transmission rate. An upper bound of the pair-wise error probability (PEP) for DOSM in Rayleigh fading channels is derived. Based on this bound we propose design criteria for the constellation rotation angel and use them to search for the optimal rotation angle for PSK constellations. Simulation results show that the proposed DOSM outperforms the existing differential spatial multiplexing schemes in terms of error-rate performance over quasi-static and time-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, it is estimated from the bound that DOSM is only 0.4 dB poorer than coherent SM in a two-input two-output system at high SNR. The computational complexity of DOSM is moderate among the differential SM systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641620/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641620/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367283","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Differential spatial multiplexing from orthogonal designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential spatial multiplexing from orthogonal designs","confLoc":"Recife","sourcePdf":"1569102661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049474S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4641625,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Tai Ho","affiliation":["IRIT/ENSEEIHT/T\u00e9SA, University of Toulouse III, Toulouse, France"],"lastName":"Anh Tai Ho","id":"37688503500"},{"name":"Marie-Laure Boucheret","affiliation":["IRIT/ENSEEIHT/T\u00e9SA, University of Toulouse III, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Laure","lastName":"Boucheret","id":"38491572500"},{"name":"Nathalie Thomas","affiliation":["IRIT/ENSEEIHT/T\u00e9SA, University of Toulouse III, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37687019400"},{"name":"Mathieu Dervin","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Dervin","id":"37541586400"},{"name":"Xavier Deplancq","affiliation":["CNES, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Deplancq","id":"37688503000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641625","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Receivers","Timing","Optimized production technology","Satellites","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM synchronization scheme","forward link","fixed broadband satellite system","OFDM receiver","single carrier waveforms","nonfrequency selective channel","intersymbol interference suppression","nonpilot aided algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an OFDM receiver for the forward link of a fixed broadband satellite system. Although the satellite channel is not frequency selective, OFDM could be preferred to single carrier waveforms if it allows to improve the system spectral efficiency. The possible gain would arise from the possibility to reduce the overhead in a non-frequency selective channel. The cyclic prefix, introduced to suppress inter symbol interference (ISI), or the pilots used to estimate the channel, are not necessary in such context. Nevertheless, a part of the overhead in OFDM-based systems is necessary for synchronization purposes. This paper focuses on this problem. We propose a complete synchronization structure essentially based on a non pilot aided algorithm, only requiring some reduced overhead for a first coarse synchronization stage. The performance of the proposed receiver is assessed through simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641625","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641625.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM synchronization scheme for the forward link of a fixed broadband satellite system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641625/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM synchronization scheme for the forward link of a fixed broadband satellite system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367288","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641625/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM synchronization scheme for the forward link of a fixed broadband satellite system","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069843S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641626,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Sanguinetti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sanguinetti","id":"37269450000"},{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Morelli","id":"37273534500"},{"name":"H.

With the proposed orthogonal and periodic training sequence, we obtain a closed-form expression for the synchronization parameters, hence greatly simplifying the algorithm complexity.

Different from most existing approaches that allocate resources based on perfect channel state information (P-CSI), this work optimizes channel scheduling and resource allocation over orthogonal fading channels when user terminals and the scheduler rely on quantized channel state information (Q-CSI). The novel unifying approach optimizes an average transmit-performance criterion subject to average quality of service requirements. The resultant optimal policy per fading realization either allocates the entire channel to a single (winner) user, or, to a small group of winner users whose percentage of shared resources is found by solving a linear program. Both alternatives become possible by smoothing the allocation scheme. The smooth policy is asymptotically optimal and incurs reduced computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","startPage":"366","endPage":"370","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641631.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum scheduling for orthogonal multiple access over fading channels using quantized channel state information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Fading","Optimal scheduling","Quality of service","Bit error rate","Schedules","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum scheduling","fading channels","quantized channel state information","orthogonal multiple access","multi-access communications","wireless fading links","channel-adaptive allocation","perfect channel state information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimum scheduling for orthogonal multiple access over fading channels using quantized channel state information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641631/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641631/","accessionNumber":"10367294","publicationDate":"July 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum scheduling for orthogonal multiple access over fading channels using quantized channel state information","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067199S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641632,"authors":[{"name":"Marios Kountouris","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Kountouris","id":"37294325000"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"},{"name":"Thomas Salzer","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D, lssy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Salzer","id":"37294311600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641632","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"abstract":"We consider a multi-antenna broadcast channel with more single-antenna receivers than transmit antennas and partial channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). An adaptive transmit mode switching scheme, in which the base station selects between single-user (TDMA) and multiuser transmission (SDMA) is proposed. In particular, we formulate a framework for distributed mode selection and sum-rate optimization with limited feedback. By assuming instantaneous local CSIT and statistical knowledge of non-local information, we derive a distributed algorithm in which each receiver feeds back scalar channel quality information (CQI) as well as its preferred mode decision. Low-complexity variants, which exhibit negligible decrease in sum rate, are also investigated. Performance analysis and simulations show that this scheme provides significant throughput gains for low to moderate number of users and linear capacity growth in the interference-limited region.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641632.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"375","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed transmit mode selection for MISO broadcast channels with limited feedback: Switching from SDMA to TDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Time division multiple access","Switches","Receivers","Gain","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast antennas","broadcast channels","feedback","receiving antennas","space division multiple access","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed transmit mode selection","MISO broadcast channels","SDMA","TDMA","channel state information at the transmitter","multiantenna broadcast channel","single-antenna receivers","adaptive transmit mode switching scheme","multiuser transmission","sum-rate optimization","channel quality information","linear capacity growth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed transmit mode selection for MISO broadcast channels with limited feedback: Switching from SDMA to TDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641632/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367295","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed transmit mode selection for MISO broadcast channels with limited feedback: Switching from SDMA to TDMA","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057516S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641634,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris Toumpakaris","affiliation":["Wireless Telecommunications Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Toumpakaris","id":"37269374100"},{"name":"Jungwon Lee","affiliation":["Wireless Telecommunications Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"lastName":"Jungwon Lee","id":"37280307900"},{"name":"Edward W.

In MIMO systems employing HARQ and equalization, optimal performance at the receiver is obtained when the signals corresponding to each transmission are combined before the equalizer. Performance can be exchanged for reduced receiver memory by first equalizing the signals after each individual reception and then combining them. For systems that use bit-level combining, post-equalization combining may be the only option for equalizer-based receiver implementation. In this paper the performance limit of post-equalization combining is derived for both linear and decision feedback equalizers used by receivers of HARQ MIMO systems. Moreover, pre-equalization combining and post-equalization combining architectures are compared in terms of the storage-performance tradeoff that they achieve.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641634","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641634.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","startPage":"381","endPage":"385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Storage-performance tradeoff for receivers of MIMO systems using hybrid ARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Storage-performance tradeoff for receivers of MIMO systems using hybrid ARQ","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641634/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367297","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641634/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Storage-performance tradeoff for receivers of MIMO systems using hybrid ARQ","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099145S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641635,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.F. de Almeida","affiliation":["I3S Laboratory, CNRS and University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"A.L.F.","lastName":"de Almeida","id":"37290281500"},{"name":"I.L.J. da Silva","affiliation":["GTEL - Wireless Telecom Res.

The reception is based on SIC detection algorithm. Standard receiver solutions for such schemes employ minimum mean square error (MMSE) successive stripping decoders. Application of MMSE filters combined with the Gaussian assumption of post detection interference institutes sub-optimality in the metrics and furthermore these equalizers are intricate in computation. We propose a novel near optimal demodulator based on match filter outputs for a 2 times 2 system which reduces the sub optimality of the metric resulting in an improved performance and a significant reduction in computational complexity with respect to the MMSE based solutions.

It is then suitable for fixed, portable and mobile receptions.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641639","startPage":"406","endPage":"410","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641639.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient 3D space time space block code for future terrestrial digital TV","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient 3D space time space block code for future terrestrial digital TV","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641639/","accessionNumber":"10367302","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641639/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient 3D space time space block code for future terrestrial digital TV","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044167S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641640,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelaziz Bouzegzi","affiliation":["CEA LETI, Minatec, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Abdelaziz","lastName":"Bouzegzi","id":"37688520100"},{"name":"Pierre Jallon","affiliation":["CEA LETI, Minatec, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Jallon","id":"37426017900"},{"name":"Philippe Ciblat","affiliation":["ENST, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Ciblat","id":"37284917800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641640","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":148},"abstract":"In the framework of cognitive radio, electro-magnetic environment sensing is a crucial task. In order to distinguish various systems relying on OFDM modulations from each others (such as WiMAX, WiFi, DVB-T), we need to be able to estimate precisely the inter-carrier spacing used in the transmitted signal. When the ratio between cyclic prefix and OFDM symbol duration is small or when the multipath propagation channel is almost as large as the cyclic prefix, standard approaches based on detection of cyclic prefix via an autocorrelation fall down. Therefore we propose a new algorithm to estimate the parameters of an OFDM modulated signal (especially the inter-carrier spacing) relying on the fourth order statistics of the received signal. We theoretically prove its robustness to multipath channels, time offset and frequency offset. Then its performance is analysed through numerical simulations and compared to standard approach which confirms the accuracy of the new algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641640.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fourth-order algorithm for blind characterization of OFDM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Correlation","Modulation","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","electromagnetic wave propagation","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fourth-order algorithm","blind characterization","OFDM signals","electromagnetic environment sensing","cognitive radio","intercarrier spacing","multipath propagation channel","parameter estimation","multipath channel","time offset","frequency offset","numerical simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A fourth-order algorithm for blind characterization of OFDM signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641640/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367303","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fourth-order algorithm for blind characterization of OFDM signals","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569098923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050603S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4641641,"authors":[{"name":"Afef Ben Hadj Alaya-Feki","affiliation":["Orange Labs - Telecom Paris Tech"],"firstName":"Afef Ben Hadj","lastName":"Alaya-Feki","id":"38272179700"},{"name":"Eric Moulines","affiliation":["Orange Labs - Telecom Paris Tech, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Moulines","id":"37294534400"},{"name":"Alain LeCornec","affiliation":["Orange Labs - Telecom Paris Tech, France"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"LeCornec","id":"38277241000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641641","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Resource management","Channel estimation","Indexes","Heuristic algorithms","Bandwidth","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","spread spectrum communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","nonstationary multi-armed bandit","cognitive radio","primary users","IEEE802.11 medium access model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi armed bandit","cognitive radio","opportunistic spectrum access"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access with non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641641.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641641","startPage":"416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641641","abstract":"Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is an emerging notion in cognitive radio, aiming to improve the spectrum usage with reliable secondary access to the spectral resources. The main challenge in DSA is the detection of spectral opportunities and their efficient utilization without causing interference to the primary users. For this goal, we propose to make use of a reinforcement learning approach: the Multi Armed Bandit (MAB). The MAB approach provides the secondary users with the rules and policies necessary to achieve a tradeoff between exploitation and exploration in DSA. Different MAB strategies are tested on an IEEE802.11 medium access model and evaluated in dynamic environment. Our study shows that the MAB constitute a viable solution for the DSA. Adding to that, the performances of the MAB algorithms can be improved with a finite tuning of the internal parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10367304","htmlLink":"/document/4641641/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access with non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access with non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073209S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4641642,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo S.

CoopMAC capitalizes on the broadcast nature of wireless channels, recruiting a relay opportunistically and on the fly to support the communication of a particular source-destination pair. Herein, we study a cross-layer framework that uses randomized cooperative coding, and allows the simultaneous recruitment of multiple relays which collectively act as the antennas of a distributed transmission array, by simply randomizing the antenna code selection rule.

First, the prior art on the cut-set upper-bound on capacity is extended by showing that the optimization of the source and relay codebooks can be formulated as a convex problem without having to introduce a scalar parameter that captures their cross-correlation. Both the Full-Duplex and Time Division Duplex (TDD) relay channels are addressed, assuming perfect knowledge of all channels, and two procedures are proposed which solve the problem efficiently by relying on analytical expressions of gradients, subgradients and projection operators: the first one solves the dual problem while the second one applies the barrier method. Similar techniques are then used to maximize the achievable rate of Decode-and-Forward (DF) TDD MIMO relaying strategies with either partial or full decoding at the relay. Sub-optimum precoders are also proposed which have a closed-form expression that can be obtained from the KKT conditions, thus reducing the computational complexity at the expense of a lower rate. Simulations in a cellular downlink scenario show that the partial DF strategy can achieve a rate very close to capacity for realistic values of the Source to Relay signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the availability of Channel State Information (CSI) in a real system is discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity bounds for Gaussian MIMO relay channel with channel state information","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641646","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641646.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity bounds for Gaussian MIMO relay channel with channel state information","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641646/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367309","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity bounds for Gaussian MIMO relay channel with channel state information","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052669S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4641647,"authors":[{"name":"Aris S.

Hence, by employing a small number of pilot symbols, phase ambiguities can be effectively resolved.

In this paper we address the role of receiver structure on performance and investigate the optimal choice of the time offset parameter. A similar timing offset V-BLAST scheme was also introduced by Shao et al., where the authors use a zero-forcing (ZF) receiver and conclude the system outperforms V-BLAST only for small block sizes. We show that the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver suggested by Shao et al. is deficient and is the main reason for some of the drawbacks observed by them. The optimal ZF receiver is derived, and along with the linear MMSE receiver, is shown to exhibit no such weaknesses. The problem of optimal offset is also examined and the optimal offset for a 2 times 2 MIMO system derived.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of receiver structure and timing offset on MIMO spatial multiplexing","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641651","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641651.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Impact of receiver structure and timing offset on MIMO spatial multiplexing","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641651/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367314","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of receiver structure and timing offset on MIMO spatial multiplexing","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043901S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641653,"authors":[{"name":"Oudomsack Pierre Pasquero","affiliation":["Institut of Electronics and Telecommunications in Rennes, INSA Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Oudomsack Pierre","lastName":"Pasquero","id":"37641152600"},{"name":"Matthieu Crussiere","affiliation":["Institut of Electronics and Telecommunications in Rennes, INSA Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Crussiere","id":"37269848800"},{"name":"Youssef Nasser","affiliation":["Institut of Electronics and Telecommunications in Rennes, INSA Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Nasser","id":"37294663300"},{"name":"Jean-Francois Helard","affiliation":["Institut of Electronics and Telecommunications in Rennes, INSA Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Francois","lastName":"Helard","id":"37269844900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641653","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Digital video broadcasting","Correlation","Silicon","Mobile communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation methods","digital video broadcasting","frequency-domain analysis","linear codes","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","precoding","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","2D linear precoded OFDM","mobile digital video broadcasting","channel estimation technique","spectral efficiency gain","mean square error estimator","autocorrelation method","frequency domain analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation technique based on 2D spread pilots.

One benefit is the improved spectral efficiency by not using a redundant CP and by having much better control of out-of-band emission. Another advantage is the ease of accommodating multiple users in an FDMA fashion especially in the uplink, i. e. the multiple access channel (MAC). On the other hand, more elaborate equalization concepts are needed compared to the single-tap per-subcarrier equalizer sufficient in the OFDM with CP case. In this contribution we will present an efficient linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization concept. Since FBMC systems employ offset-quadrature-amplitude-modulation (OQAM), a fractionally spaced per-subcarrier equalizer will be derived, which takes into account the inter-subcarrier interference due to frequency selective multipath fading. Still this is handled with decoupled per-subcarrier equalizers. Simulation results will show that OQAMFBMCs allow for savings in transmit power which have to be paid with a practicable amount of computational overhead.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641663","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641663.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE subcarrier equalization for filter bank based multicarrier systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641663/","displayDocTitle":"MMSE subcarrier equalization for filter bank based multicarrier systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367326","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641663/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE subcarrier equalization for filter bank based multicarrier systems","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041554S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641664,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To preserve a high bit rate, channel shortening method is required to reduce the redundancy. Recently, channel shortening technique with differential encoded OFDM systems without the NT was introduced. This technique is very simple and achieves the channel shortening using only one symbol (the first emitted symbol). In this paper, we prove that, in the presence of null-tones (used in most OFDM-based communication standards), the performance of the previous technique decreases. Therefore, we propose an alternative solution that improves the receiverpsilas performance and preserves a high BER (Bit Error Rate) quality in presence of null-tones.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641664.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"534","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new blind channel shortening for differential encoded OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Encoding","Delay","Noise","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel shortening","differential encoded OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","inter-symbol interference","interblock interference","null-tones","cyclic prefix redundancy","BER","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new blind channel shortening for differential encoded OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641664/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367327","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new blind channel shortening for differential encoded OFDM system","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569104045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040441S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641665,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In margin adaptive objective, base station (BS) has to satisfy individual quality of service (QoS) constraints of the users subject to transmit power minimization. The solution is hard to achieve because multiple streams from different users on the same subcarrier cause inter-stream interference which forces the use of low complexity beamforming techniques and makes it a joint beamforming and resource allocation problem. We propose a sub-optimal two step solution which decouples beamforming from subcarrier and power allocation. First a reduced number of user groups are formed and then the problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Finally an efficient algorithm is developed which allocates subcarriers to these user groups.

A coded adaptive LP-DMT system is presented in the PLC context with a loading algorithm which accommodates the channel coding gains in bit and energy calculations. The performance of a concatenated channel coding scheme, consisting of an inner Weipsilas 4-dimensional 16-states trellis code and an outer Reed-Solomon code, in combination with the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results are presented for a fixed target bit error rate in a multicarrier scenario under power spectral density constraint. Using a multipath model of PLC channel, it is shown that the proposed coded adaptive LP-DMT system performs better than classical coded discrete multitone.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coded bit-loading linear precoded discrete multitone solution for power line communication","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641669","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641669.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A coded bit-loading linear precoded discrete multitone solution for power line communication","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641669/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10367332","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coded bit-loading linear precoded discrete multitone solution for power line communication","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569102675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06839S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641674,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Kaltenberger","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Kaltenberger","id":"37392197300"},{"name":"Marios Kountouris","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Kountouris","id":"37294325000"},{"name":"Leonardo Cardoso","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Chair in Flexible Radio, SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Cardoso","id":"37700622600"},{"name":"Raymond Knopp","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Knopp","id":"37283390500"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2046-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"4641674","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":981},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641674","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Signal to noise ratio","Time division multiple access","Receiving antennas","Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","channel coding","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system","spatial multiplexing","multiple antenna","signal processing","channel rank loss","antenna correlation","channel measurement data","Eurecom MIMO Openair Sounder","MMSE precoder","linear multi-user MIMO precoding scheme"]}],"abstract":"In multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, spatial multiplexing can be employed to increase the throughput without the need for multiple antennas and expensive signal processing at the user equipments.

In this paper we compare the performance of different linear MU-MIMO precoding schemes using real channel measurement data. The measurement data has been acquired using Eurecompsilas MIMO Openair Sounder (EMOS). The EMOS can perform real-time MIMO channel measurements synchronously over multiple users. The results show that MU-MIMO provides a higher throughput than SU-MIMO also in the measured channels. However, the throughput in the measured channels is by far worse than the one in channels without spatial correlation.

During this initialization phase, any other scheme for distributed Bayesian estimation utilizing communication among the same nodes must have equal or worse performance to EP. We discuss the sub-optimality of some other proposed schemes for distributed estimation in sensor networks: consensus propagation and distributed adaptive filtering, arguing that these techniques may presently be seen as seeking suboptimal performance among particular cost functions and with a goal of reduced computation and complexity relative to EP.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Sleep","Wireless sensor networks","Training","Estimation","Gain","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","Bayes methods","electromagnetic wave propagation","estimation theory","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation propagation","wireless sensor network initialization","distributed Bayesian estimation","distributed adaptive filtering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641682","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 9th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4634580/4641557/04641682.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2008.4641682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimality of expectation propagation based distributed estimation for wireless sensor network initialization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimality of expectation propagation based distributed estimation for wireless sensor network initialization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641682/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641682/","accessionNumber":"10367345","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimality of expectation propagation based distributed estimation for wireless sensor network initialization","confLoc":"Recife, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1569101605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06244S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4634580","isNumber":"4641557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4634580","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641557","articleId":"4641682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641697,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the sensitivity of one-terminal and two-terminal impedance based fault location methods to parameters such as the fault resistance and the fault position. The mathematical modeling of three classical impedance-based fault location methods is presented and the influence of each possible error source in these algorithms is highlighted.

The function based Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy controller has minimum number of rules (only two rules) and generates the proportional action which by one-to-two inference mapping presents a variable gain PI controller.

The solution of this problem comprises addition of new feeders to get the system back to an adequate operating level. The formulation of this problem results in a optimization problem classified as of NP- hard. Additionally, there are operational constraints that must be considered, such as the maximum current per feeder and the consideration that some feeders are forced to share routes in urban areas. Given the real demand data and the planning period, a new load forecast is performed making possible to determine the number of feeders to supply the loads. Due to the size of the problem, a ldquodivide and conquerrdquo strategy is applied by means of Voronoi polygons, making possible to establish coverage areas for each feeder. The final assigned areas are determined using a genetic algorithm (GA) that balances the load among feeders. Thus, the expansion problem is divided into coverage areas and for each of them a GA based on the generation of random spanning trees where three different types of costs are considered (expansion costs, reinforcement costs and operational costs) is applied. This paper presents results for artificially simulated system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641797/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10367057","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641797/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and Voronoi polygons applied to decision making in the distribution systems expansion problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and Voronoi polygons applied to decision making in the distribution systems expansion problem","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"Paper 323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067276S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4629858","isNumber":"4641687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4629858","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641687","articleId":"4641797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641818,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The new proposed methodology implements the WTs to extract predominant transient signals originated by transformer internal faults and captured from the current transformers. The Wavelet Transform is an efficient signal processing tool used to study non stationary signals with fast transition (high frequency components), mapping the signal in time-frequency representation. The three phase differential currents are the input signals used on-line to detect internal faults. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated through simulation of different internal faults and switching conditions on a power transformer using ATP/EMTP software. The analyzed data is obtained from simulation of different normal and faulty operating conditions such as internal faults - phase/phase, phase/ground-, magnetizing inrush and external faults. The case study shows that the new algorithm is highly accurate and effective.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition: Latin America","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629858/4641687/04641818.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition: Latin America","doi":"10.1109/TDC-LA.2008.4641818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC-LA.2008.4641818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential protection of three-phase transformers using Wavelet Transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current transformers","Relays","Circuit faults","Power transformers","Discrete wavelet transforms","Power transformer insulation","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current transformers","power transformer protection","signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential protection","transformer protection","wavelet transforms","transformer internal faults","current transformers","signal processing tool","ATP/EMTP software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential protection","inrush current","internal faults","power transformer","wavelets transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Differential protection of three-phase transformers using Wavelet Transforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10367078","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential protection of three-phase transformers using Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"Paper 346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097847S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4629858","isNumber":"4641687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4629858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4641687","articleId":"4641818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641832,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this letter, we propose a low complexity soft-output channel detector based on the Chase decoding algorithm, which was previously applied to decode turbo product codes. At each iteration, the proposed detector forms a candidate list using all possible combinations of bit patterns in the weakest indices based on tentative hard estimates and a priori information fed back from the outer decoder. To demonstrate the performance/complexity tradeoff of the proposed detector, simulation results over rate-8/9 turbo-coded EPR4 and ME/sup 2/PR4 channels are presented, respectively. It is shown that the proposed detector can significantly reduce the computational complexity with only a small performance loss compared to the BCJR algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Detectors","Intersymbol interference","Turbo codes","Computational complexity","Additive white noise","AWGN","Gaussian noise","Matched filters","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","equalisers","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial-response channels","decoding","soft-input/soft-output detector","SISO","computational complexity","Chase decoding algorithm","turbo product codes","BCJR algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chase decoding","local search","turbo codes","turbo equalization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4641880/04641884.pdf","startPage":"1575","endPage":"1580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative reduced-search decoding for coded partial-response channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative reduced-search decoding for coded partial-response channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641884/","volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641884/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10251535","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative reduced-search decoding for coded partial-response channels","sourcePdf":"tc_0810_1575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05429S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4641880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"4641880","articleId":"4641884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4641889,"authors":[{"name":"Ziad A.

Based on the statistical properties of least-squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation, an optimal diversity receiver for wireless systems employing practical linear channel estimation on Rician fading channels is proposed. The new receiver structure includes the conventional maximal ratio combining receiver as a special case. Exact analytical expressions for the symbol error rates (SERs) of LS and MMSE channel estimation aided optimal diversity combining are derived. It is shown that, if an optimal detector is used, an MPSK wireless system with MMSE channel estimation has the same SER when the MMSE channel estimation is replaced by LS estimation. This is an interesting counterexample to the common perception that channel estimation with smaller mean square error leads to smaller SER.

We use both the maximum-likelihood decoding criteria and iterative decoding criteria to design universal SCTCMs for the PEC and the PFC. For the space-time channel, by demultiplexing the symbols across the antennas, the proposed universal SCTCMs for the period-2 PFC deliver consistent performance over the eigenvalue skew of the matrix channel. Within the family of channels having the same eigenvalue skew, a time-varying linear transformation (TVLT) is used to mitigate the performance variation over different eigenvectors. The proposed space-time SCTCMs of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 bits per transmission require excess mutual information in the ranges 0.11-0.15, 0.23- 0.26 and 0.35-0.53 bits per antenna, respectively. Because of their consistent performance over all channels, the proposed codes will have good frame-error-rate (FER) performance over any quasi-static fading distribution.

This problem is challenging in the sense that the transmitter should be designed to beamform across multiple eigenspaces associated with the multipath environment simultaneously. With arbitrary transmit spatial correlation, the performance analysis for SF-coded MIMO-OFDM systems with beamforming is provided, and a general optimization problem for the beamforming design is formulated. Three suboptimal approaches to design the beamformer based on the derived design criteria are proposed: i) eigenvalue selection scheme; ii) eigenspace selection scheme; and iii) per-subcarrier approach based on decoding at each subcarrier. The proposed schemes take into account the multiple eigenspace information associated with the multipath-delay channel. Improvement in the performance over SF coding without beamforming is shown through simulations in terms of bit error rate. The eigenvalue selection scheme provides the best performance among the proposed algorithms. This scheme locates the subspace associated with the largest eigenvalues in the eigenspace of the covariance matrices. With the eigenvalue selection scheme, the performance improvement is about 3 dB over the SF coding without beamforming for highly correlated channels as shown in our simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit beamforming for space-frequency coded MIMO-OFDM systems with spatial correlation feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4641880/04641895.pdf","startPage":"1647","endPage":"1655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming for space-frequency coded MIMO-OFDM systems with spatial correlation feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4641895/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251546","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming for space-frequency coded MIMO-OFDM systems with spatial correlation feedback","sourcePdf":"tc_0810_1647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104069S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4641880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4641880","articleId":"4641895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4641896,"authors":[{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Balearic Islands, Palma de Mallorca, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4641880/4641896/4641896-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Felip Riera-Palou received the MS degree in Computer Engineering from the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), (Palma de Mallorca, Spain) in 1997, the MSc and PhD degrees in Communication Engineering from the University of Bradford (Bradford, UK) in 1998 and 2002, respectively, and the MSc degree in Statistics from the University of Sheffield (Sheffield, UK) in 2006.

When full channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter and receivers, the problem can be readily solved using dirty paper coding (DPC) and the application of convex optimization techniques on the dual problem which is the multiple access channel (MAC). Since in many practical application full CSI may not be feasible and computational complexity prohibitive when the number of users is large, we focus on other simple schemes that require very little CSI: time-division opportunistic (TO) beamforming where in different time slots (of different lengths) the transmitter performs opportunistic beamforming to the users requiring the same rate, and weighted opportunistic (WO) beamforming where the random beams are assigned to those users having the largest weighted SINR. For single antenna systems we also look at the capacity-achieving superposition coding (SC) scheme. In all cases, we determine explicit schedules to guarantee the rate constraints and show that, in the limit of large number of users, the throughput loss compared to the unconstrained throughput (sum-rate capacity) tends to zero. We further provide bounds on the rate of convergence of the sum-rates of these schemes to the sum-rate capacity. Finally, we provide simulation results of the performance of different scheduling schemes considered in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.4641899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4641880/04641899.pdf","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.4641899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differentiated rate scheduling for the down-link of cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641899/","displayDocTitle":"Differentiated rate scheduling for the down-link of cellular systems","volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251552","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641899/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differentiated rate scheduling for the down-link of cellular systems","sourcePdf":"tc_0810_1683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069628S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4641880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4641880","articleId":"4641899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4641901,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4641880/4641901/4641901-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Yang received the B.E. degree in electronic information engineering from the Radio Department of Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2000, and the M.S. degree in optimization and numerical methods from the Singapore-MIT Alliance, National University of Singapore, in 2002.

We first treat such a cross-layer design problem with fixed radio distributions across the nodes and formulate it as a large-scale convex optimization problem. A primal-dual method together with the column-generation technique is proposed to efficiently solve this problem. We then consider the radio allocation problem, i.e., the optimal placement of radios within the network to maximize the network utility function. This problem is formulated as a large- scale combinatorial optimization problem. We derive the necessary conditions that the optimal solution should satisfy, and then develop a sequential optimization scheme to solve this problem. Simulation studies are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed cross-layer network planning framework. It is seen that the proposed approach can significantly enhance the overall network performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","volume":"56","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"10251532","publicationDate":"October 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641901/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer network planning for multi-radio multi-channel cognitive wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer network planning for multi-radio multi-channel cognitive wireless networks","sourcePdf":"tc_0810_1705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092918S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4641880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4641880","articleId":"4641901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641905,"authors":[{"name":"Yinghui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4641880/4641905/4641905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yinghui Li (S'05) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2007.

Consequently, the general MIMO array design problem is challenging. This paper proposes a novel optimization methodology for designing circular patch arrays (CPAs), under a clustered MIMO channel model assumption. Based on the ergodic capacity, it is found that the single-cluster scenario can approximate CPA performance in clustered channels, reducing the number of channel scenarios that need to be considered. Using a new definition of channel spatial correlation that allows for pattern diversity, metrics are derived for evaluating average and outage capacity performance of CPAs, which can be expressed as a function of only the antenna parameters. With this expression, an optimization is formulated and solved numerically for optimizing the parameters of a 2-CPA on a capacity based objective function and microwave theory performance constraints. An example design is given corresponding to a 2-CPA in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency band.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4641880/04641906.pdf","startPage":"1748","endPage":"1759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization methodology for designing 2-CPAs exploiting pattern diversity in clustered MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Design methodology","MIMO","Constraint optimization","Microwave antenna arrays","Communication systems","Microwave measurements","Microwave theory and techniques","Constraint theory","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","channel capacity","diversity reception","microstrip antennas","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern diversity","clustered MIMO channels","multiple-input multiple-output communication systems","circular patch antenna arrays","ergodic capacity","channel spatial correlation","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","antenna arrays","pattern diversity","microstrip antennas","spatially correlated channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimization methodology for designing 2-CPAs exploiting pattern diversity in clustered MIMO channels","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4641906/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251555","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization methodology for designing 2-CPAs exploiting pattern diversity in clustered MIMO channels","sourcePdf":"tc_0810_1748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199836S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4641880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4641880","articleId":"4641906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4641930,"authors":[{"name":"Pornpit Wongthongtham","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystems and Business Intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5109889/4641930/4641930-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pornpit Wongthongtham received the BSc degree in mathematics, the MSc degree in computer science, and the PhD degree in information systems.

A key and still open issue in iris recognition is how best to represent such textural information using a compact set of features (iris features). In this paper, we propose using ordinal measures for iris feature representation with the objective of characterizing qualitative relationships between iris regions rather than precise measurements of iris image structures. Such a representation may lose some image-specific information, but it achieves a good trade-off between distinctiveness and robustness. We show that ordinal measures are intrinsic features of iris patterns and largely invariant to illumination changes. Moreover, compactness and low computational complexity of ordinal measures enable highly efficient iris recognition. Ordinal measures are a general concept useful for image analysis and many variants can be derived for ordinal feature extraction. In this paper, we develop multilobe differential filters to compute ordinal measures with flexible intralobe and interlobe parameters such as location, scale, orientation, and distance. Experimental results on three public iris image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ordinal feature models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ordinal Measures for Iris Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.240","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5291213/04641931.pdf","startPage":"2211","endPage":"2226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641931/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Ordinal Measures for Iris Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4641931/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940915","pubMedId":"19834142","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ordinal Measures for Iris Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2009122211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095044S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5291213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"5291213","articleId":"4641931","onlineDate":"10 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4641933,"authors":[{"name":"Anil K.

While palmprint-based personal authentication systems have been developed, they mostly deal with low resolution (about 100 ppi) palmprints and only perform full-to-full matching. We propose a latent-to-full palmprint matching system that is needed in forensics. Our system deals with palmprints captured at 500 ppi and uses minutiae as features. Latent palmprint matching is a challenging problem because latents lifted at crime scenes are of poor quality, cover small area of palms and have complex background. Other difficulties include the presence of many creases and a large number of minutiae in palmprints. A robust algorithm to estimate ridge direction and frequency in palmprints is developed. This facilitates minutiae extraction even in poor quality palmprints. A fixed-length minutia descriptor, MinutiaCode, is utilized to capture distinctive information around each minutia and an alignment-based matching algorithm is used to match palmprints. Two sets of partial palmprints (150 live-scan partial palmprints and 100 latents) are matched to a background database of 10,200 full palmprints to test the proposed system. Rank-1 recognition rates of 78.7% and 69%, respectively, were achieved for live-scan palmprints and latents.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816105","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1047","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4816105/04641933.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641933","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forensics","Fingerprint recognition","Friction","Skin","Fingers","Layout","Frequency estimation","Spatial databases","Sweat glands","Epidermis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","edge detection","image matching","police data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["latent-to-full palmprint matching system","forensics","palmprint-based personal authentication systems","crime scenes","ridge direction estimation","minutiae extraction","MinutiaCode","fixed-length minutia descriptor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fingerprint","palmprint"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Dermatoglyphics","Hand","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Photography","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]},{"kwd":["fingerprint","palmprint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Latent Palmprint Matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10575235","pubMedId":"19372608","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4641933/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641933/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latent Palmprint Matching","sourcePdf":"ttp2009061032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071604S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4816105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"210","xplore-issue":"4816105","articleId":"4641933","onlineDate":"10 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":4641945,"authors":[{"name":"Robert W.

Unfortunately, many kinds of channel adaptive techniques have been deemed impractical in the past because of the problem of obtaining channel knowledge at the transmitter. The transmitter in many systems (such as those using frequency division duplexing) can not leverage techniques such as training to obtain channel state information. Over the last few years, research has repeatedly shown that allowing the receiver to send a small number of information bits about the channel conditions to the transmitter can allow near optimal channel adaptation. These practical systems, which are commonly referred to as limited or finite-rate feedback systems, supply benefits nearly identical to unrealizable perfect transmitter channel knowledge systems when they are judiciously designed. In this tutorial, we provide a broad look at the field of limited feedback wireless communications. We review work in systems using various combinations of single antenna, multiple antenna, narrowband, broadband, single-user, and multiuser technology. We also provide a synopsis of the role of limited feedback in the standardization of next generation wireless systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","volume":"26","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10251575","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641946/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An overview of limited feedback in wireless communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of limited feedback in wireless communication systems","sourcePdf":"1341jsac1008love.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.428787S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1011","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4641948,"authors":[{"name":"Sohraab Soltani","affiliation":["The Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641948/4641948-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sohraab Soltani received the B.E. degree (Hons.) in Computer Science and Engineering from the Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 2003 and the M.S degree in 2006 from Michigan State University (MSU), East Lansing, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering.","His research interest includes wireless communication, wireless networking, stochastic modeling, and channel coding."]},"firstName":"Sohraab","lastName":"Soltani","id":"37684320500"},{"name":"Hayder Radha","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641948/4641948-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hayder Radha received the Ph.M. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1991 and 1993, the M.S. degree from Purdue University in 1986, and the B.S. degree (with honors) from Michigan State University (MSU) in 1984 (all in electrical engineering).

Although the current IEEE802.11 standard ARQ error control protocol performs relatively well over channels with very low bit error rates (BERs), this performance deteriorates rapidly as the BER increases. This paper investigates the problem of reliable transmission in a contention free wireless LAN and introduces a packet embedded error control (PEEC) protocol, which employs packet-embedded parity symbols instead of ARQ-based retransmission for error recovery. Specifically, depending on receiver feedback, PEEC adaptively estimates channel conditions and administers the transmission of (data and parity) symbols within a packet. This enables successful recovery of both new data and old unrecovered data from prior transmissions. In addition to theoretically analyzing PEEC, the performance of the proposed scheme is extensively analyzed over real channel traces collected on 802.11b WLANs. We compare PEEC performance with the performance of the IEEE802.il standard ARQ protocol as well as contemporary protocols such as enhanced ARQ and the hybrid ARQ/FEC. Our analysis and experimental simulations show that PEEC outperforms all three competing protocols over a wide range of actual 802.11b WLAN collected traces. Finally, the design and implementation of PEEC using an adaptive low-density-parity-check (A-LDPC) decoder is presented.","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641948.pdf","startPage":"1376","endPage":"1385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081004","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641948","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Automatic repeat request","Error correction","Bit error rate","Performance analysis","Wireless application protocol","Feedback","Forward error correction","Analytical models","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","error correction codes","error statistics","forward error correction","IEEE standards","parity check codes","protocols","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PEEC","channel-adaptive feedback","error control protocol","wireless MAC layer","IEEE802.11 standard","ARQ","bit error rates","BER","reliable transmission","WLAN","adaptive low-density-parity-check decoder","A-LDPC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward error correction","Channel coding","Wireless LAN","Feedback communication","Automatic repeat request"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"PEEC: a channel-adaptive feedback-based error","accessionNumber":"10251577","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641948/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PEEC: a channel-adaptive feedback-based error","sourcePdf":"1376jsac1008soltani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064459S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641952,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy Tannious","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641952/4641952-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ramy Tannious [S'04] received the B.Sc.

We devise relay selection methods to recover the multiplexing loss in decode-and-forward (DF) relay networks, while requiring very little feedback (merely bits/relay). Two network topologies are studied: First the case is considered where a direct link is available between the source and destination, in addition to the relayed links. For this configuration, an incremental transmission scheme is proposed, and comprehensively analyzed, which uses limited feedback to improve both diversity as well as multiplexing gain. Then, the case without a direct link is considered, for which efficient non-orthogonal DF protocols are produced and analyzed. An interesting feature of the latter methods is unequal error protection capability via a family of embedded diversity-multiplexing (DMT) curves, which can be very useful for practical applications. Even considering this method's minimal DMT, a marked improvement over previous DF methods is observed, especially in high spectral efficiencies.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081008","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641952.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081008","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1419","endPage":"1428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally-efficient relay selection with limited feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spectrally-efficient relay selection with limited feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641952/","volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4641952/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251579","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally-efficient relay selection with limited feedback","sourcePdf":"1419jsac1008tannious.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125828S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641953,"authors":[{"name":"Erdem Koyuncu","affiliation":["Engineering and Computering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641953/4641953-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erdem Koyuncu received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering of Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey in 2005, and the M.S. degree in 2006 from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, where he is currently a Ph.D. candidate.

We use the generalized Lloyd algorithm (GLA) to design the quantizer of the feedback information and specifically to optimize the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system. Achievable bounds for different performance measures are derived. First, we analytically show that a simple feedback scheme based on relay selection can achieve full diversity. Unlike the previous diversity analysis on the relay selection scheme, our analysis is not aided by any approximations or modified forwarding schemes. Then, for highrate feedback, we find an upper bound on the average signalto- noise ratio (SNR) loss. Using this result, we demonstrate that both the average SNR loss and the capacity loss decay at least exponentially with the number of feedback bits. In addition, we provide approximate upper and lower bounds on the BER, which can be calculated numerically.We observe that our designs can achieve both full diversity as well as high array gain with only a moderate number of feedback bits. Simulations also show that our approximate BER is a reliable estimation on the actual BER.

We consider an OFDMA model in which the feedback overhead is explicitly taken into account, given a fixed feedback rate and finite coherence time. The tradeoff between feedback rate and sum capacity is studied for two limited feedback schemes: a sequential scheme in which the users send compressed feedback bits over consecutive time slots, and a contention scheme in which users send their feedback via a random access protocol. For both schemes each feedback bit indicates a request for a group containing multiple subchannels. We show that the sum capacity for both schemes with optimized sub-channel groups grows linearly with the number of sub-channels N, and that the associated constant increases as the log of the normalized feedback rate measured in bits per coherence time per sub-channel. We also compare the asymptotic (large N) performance of the two limited feedback schemes as a function of the feedback rate and load (users per sub-channel). The sequential scheme performs best with moderate to large feedback rates, or small loads, whereas the contention scheme performs best with small feedback rates or large loads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited feedback schemes for downlink OFDMA based on sub-channel groups","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081011","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641955.pdf","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641955/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","displayDocTitle":"Limited feedback schemes for downlink OFDMA based on sub-channel groups","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4641955/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251589","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited feedback schemes for downlink OFDMA based on sub-channel groups","sourcePdf":"1451jsac1008chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152683S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641956,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641956/4641956-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajiv Agarwal completed his B.

In this paper, two constant complexity limited-feedback algorithms are proposed to achieve near-optimal performance. First, using opportunistic feedback, the proposed schemes are shown to reduce feedback overhead by requiring only users likely to be allocated resources to feedback. There are differences between the two proposed schemes for implementation of the feedback protocol. One scheme requires less feedback but is contention-based, while the other scheme is sequential and thus avoids possible collisions leading to slightly higher performance, but needs more feedback. Second, complexity is reduced for resource allocation by solving the optimization problem in a distributed manner, rather than centrally at the base station. As shown both analytically and through numerical results, these distributed algorithms reduce the required feedback overhead significantly, and achieve constant computational complexity with little performance loss compared to the optimal solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity resource allocation with opportunistic feedback over downlink OFDMA networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641956.pdf","startPage":"1462","endPage":"1472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity resource allocation with opportunistic feedback over downlink OFDMA networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4641956/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251581","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity resource allocation with opportunistic feedback over downlink OFDMA networks","sourcePdf":"1462jsac1008agarwal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088359S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4641957,"authors":[{"name":"Niranjay Ravindran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641957/4641957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Niranjay Ravindran (S'02) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2001.

This low-complexity scheme operates only a few dB away from capacity but requires very accurate channel knowledge at the transmitter. We consider a limited feedback system where each receiver knows its channel perfectly, but the transmitter is only provided with a finite number of channel feedback bits from each receiver. Using a random quantization argument, we quantify the throughput loss due to imperfect channel knowledge as a function of the feedback level. The quality of channel knowledge must improve proportional to the SNR in order to prevent interference-limitations, and we show that scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the system SNR is sufficient to maintain a bounded rate loss. Finally, we compare our quantization strategy to an analog feedback scheme and show the superiority of quantized feedback.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641957.pdf","startPage":"1473","endPage":"1482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited feedback-based block diagonalization for the MIMO broadcast channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641957/","displayDocTitle":"Limited feedback-based block diagonalization for the MIMO broadcast channel","volume":"26","issue":"8","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251582","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4641957/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited feedback-based block diagonalization for the MIMO broadcast channel","sourcePdf":"1473jsac1008ravindran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095858S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"186","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4641958,"authors":[{"name":"Adam L.

The paper then develops a linear beamforming precoding strategy based on channel distribution information in the form of a full spatial correlation matrix for each user. This algorithm is shown to provide highly stable communication, with a throughput that is higher than that for optimal precoders operating on outdated CSI, in a time-variant environment, indicating that this approach can operate with significantly reduced feedback frequency. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the use of the well-known Kronecker and Weichselberger models to parameterize the full correlation matrix to enable further reduction in the amount of feedback data required for implementation of the new beamforming technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-feedback linear precoding with stable performance for the time-varying MIMO broadcast channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081014","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641958.pdf","startPage":"1483","endPage":"1493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641958/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-feedback linear precoding with stable performance for the time-varying MIMO broadcast channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4641958/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251583","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-feedback linear precoding with stable performance for the time-varying MIMO broadcast channel","sourcePdf":"1483jsac1008anderson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136678S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641959,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Trivellato","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641959/4641959-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matteo Trivellato was born in Padova, Italy on March 13th, 1981.

The receiver combining and quantization for CSIT feedback are jointly designed in order to maximize the expected SINR for each user. We provide an analytic characterization of the achievable throughput in the case of many users and show how additional receive antennas or higher multiuser diversity can reduce the required feedback rate to achieve a target throughput.We also propose a design methodology for generating codebooks tailored for arbitrary spatial correlation statistics. The resulting codebooks have a tree structure that can be utilized in time-correlated MIMO channels to significantly reduce feedback overhead.

Unlike past work in which iterative computation is required to design the beamformers, we derive specific formulations for the transmit beamformers for two active users via a power iteration and a generalized eigen analysis. To enable practical implementation, a new limited feedback algorithm is proposed that exploits the structure of the algorithm to avoid full channel quantization. The feedback overhead of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of receive antennas.

A limited feedback-based scheduling and precoding scenario is considered that builds on the multiuser random beamforming (RBF). Such a scheme was shown to yield the same capacity scaling, in terms of multiplexing and multiuser diversity gain, as the optimal full CSIT-based (channel state information at transmitter) precoding scheme, in the large number of users K regime. Unfortunately, for more practically relevant (low to moderate) K values, RBF yields degraded performance. In this work, we investigate solutions to this problem. We introduce a two-stage framework that decouples the scheduling and beamforming problems. In our scenario, RBF is exploited to identify good, spatially separable, users in a first stage. In the second stage, the initial random beams are refined based on the available feedback to offer improved performance toward the selected users. Specifically, we propose beam power control techniques that do not change the direction of the second-stage beams, offering feedback reduction and performance tradeoffs. The common feature of these schemes is to restore robustness of RBF with respect to sparse network settings (low K), at the cost of moderate complexity increase.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641963.pdf","startPage":"1536","endPage":"1545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced multiuser random beamforming: dealing with the not so large number of users case","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Feedback","Downlink","Base stations","Diversity methods","Channel state information","Transmitters","Degradation","Power control","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","channel capacity","multiplexing","multiuser channels","precoding","radiocommunication","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced multiuser random beamforming","wireless system downlink","M-antenna base station","K single-antenna users","feedback-based scheduling","capacity scaling","multiuser diversity gain","multiplexing","channel state information","transmitter precoding scheme","power control beam techniques","feedback reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","Random Beamforming","Power Control","Scheduling","Partial CSIT","Sparse networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced multiuser random beamforming: dealing with the not so large number of users case","volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4641963/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251585","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced multiuser random beamforming: dealing with the not so large number of users case","sourcePdf":"1536jsac1008kountouris.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092594S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641964,"authors":[{"name":"Prasanna Chaporkar","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641964/4641964-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Prasanna Chaporkar received M.S. in Faculty of Engineering from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India in 2000, and Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA in 2006.

To achieve the gains promised by this kind of diversity, the transmitter has to accurately track the channel variations of the various receivers, which consumes resources (time, energy, bandwidth), and thus reduces the resources remaining for effective data transmissions. The transmitter may decide not to acquire or probe the channel conditions of certain receivers, either because these receivers are presumably experiencing severe fading, or because the transmitter wishes to spare resources for data transmissions. It may also decide to transmit to a receiver without probing its channel; in such cases, the transmitter guesses the channel state, which often results in a reduction of the transmission rate compared to when the transmitter knows the channel state. Ultimately, the transmitter has to decide to which receiver it should transmit. In this paper, we identifying the joint probing and transmission strategies realizing the optimal trade-off between the channel state acquisition and the effective data transmission. The objective is to maximize the system throughput. Finally, we propose several extensions of the proposed strategy, including a scheme to maximize the system utility and a scheme to ensure the system stability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641964.pdf","endPage":"1555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal joint probing and transmission strategy for maximizing throughput in wireless systems","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081020","startPage":"1546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal joint probing and transmission strategy for maximizing throughput in wireless systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641964/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251586","publicationDate":"October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4641964/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal joint probing and transmission strategy for maximizing throughput in wireless systems","sourcePdf":"1546jsac1008chaporkar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082833S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4641965,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Tae Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641965/4641965-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young- Tae Kim (S'07) received the B.S., M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea in 2006 and 2008, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the school of Electrical Engineering.

The OSM scheme was recently introduced for closed-loop MIMO systems which allows single symbol decodable maximum likelihood detection. To further improve the performance of the OSM system, we propose a new precoding method by maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance between constellation points in the effective channel. In order to efficiently identify the parameters of a precoder which maximizes the minimum distance, we introduce a partitioning approach. Through analysis, it is shown that one real value parameter and two bits are required for feedback information for precoding in 16-QAM systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm provides 9 dB and 7.5 dB gains at a bit error rate (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n over the conventional OSM systems for 4-QAM and 16-QAM, respectively.

Using channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, channel matrix can be decomposed via singular value decomposition (SVD), and if the transmitter can be fed back with the right-unitary-matrix of the SVD from the receiver, the maximum channel-capacity can be achieved with linear processing in point-to-point wireless MIMO communications. However, if the transmitter receives no-feedback, the optimal linear detector at the receiver is the minimum-mean-squareerror- estimator, of which capacity is far below the channelcapacity. In practice, reducing the amount of feedback information to achieve a \"reasonably close channel-capacity\" is an important issue in point-to-point wireless communications. In this paper, we propose a limited feedback system employing linear processing, which achieves near-channel-capacity. The feedback information is only an integer matrix, which is much less than that of the right-unitary-matrix of the SVD. Key ideas of the proposed scheme are the lattice reduction and modulo operation. Moreover, the amount of feedback information can be further reduced to a binary matrix using multi-level/multi-stage encode and decode. Under the turbo channel code the proposed scheme shows excellent performance at high data rates. We compare our simulation results with Shannon capacity limits for ergodic MIMO channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10251592","volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4641966/","publicationDate":"October 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Capacity and performance of lattice reduction aided linear processing with lattice encoding and decoding in limited feedback systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and performance of lattice reduction aided linear processing with lattice encoding and decoding in limited feedback systems","sourcePdf":"1567jsac1008kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087926S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4641967,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Botros Shenouda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641967/4641967-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Botros Shenouda received the B.Sc.

The channel state information (CSI) available at the receiver is assumed to be perfect, and based on this information the receiver selects a suitable precoder from a codebook and feeds back the index of this precoder to the transmitter. Our approach to the design of the components of this limited feedback scheme is based on the development, herein, of a unified framework for the joint design of the precoder and the ZF-DFE under the assumption that perfect CSI is available at both the transmitter and the receiver. The framework is general and embraces a wide range of design criteria. This framework enables us to characterize the statistical distribution of the optimal precoder in a standard Rayleigh fading environment. Using this distribution, we show that codebooks constructed from Grassmann packings minimize an upper bound on an average distortion measure, and hence are natural candidates for the codebook in limited feedback systems. Our simulation studies show that the proposed limited feedback scheme can provide significantly better performance at a lower feedback rate than existing schemes in which the detection order is fed back to the transmitter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design framework for limited feedback MIMO systems with zero-forcing DFE","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.081023","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4641942/04641967.pdf","startPage":"1578","endPage":"1587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.081023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4641942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4641967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4641967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","displayDocTitle":"A design framework for limited feedback MIMO systems with zero-forcing DFE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4641967/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251593","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design framework for limited feedback MIMO systems with zero-forcing DFE","sourcePdf":"1578jsac1008shenouda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127806S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4641942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4641942","articleId":"4641967","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4641969,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Hui Tan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4641942/4641969/4641969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Hui Tan (S'00-M'05) received the M.

Indeed, it is already being considered as one of the key candidate technologies for the fourth-generation wireless systems. There are several drivers for the development of cognitive radio. Perhaps by far the most pressing of them is improved utilization of the electromagnetic radio spectrum: a highly valuable natural resource. Careful studies of the current usage of the radio spectrum by several agencies have already revealed that a large fraction of the radio spectrum is inadequately utilized. This basic finding has led to numerous research initiatives. For instance, five European projects addressing a multitude of cognitive radio topics were recently approved with a total budget of more than 50 M/spl Euro/, including ARAGORN (www.ict-aragorn.eu), EUWB (www.euwb.eu), PHYDYAS (www.ist-phydyas.org), E\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n (www.ict-e3.eu), SENDORA (www.sendora.eu). Moreover there are emerging companies who apply cognitive radio principles for sensing the environment (e.g. self-organizing femtocells) in order to efficiently exploit the bandwidth resources and also to minimize interference (e.g., www.ubiquisys.com, www.adaptrum.com). Several cognitive radio test trials were created by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to investigate the impact of cognitive radios in \"white spaces\" (i.e., the under-utilized TV frequencies). Recently, even a \"white space coalition\" consisting of eight large companies was founded in order to promote the usefulness of the not yet publicly available analog television broadcast frequency bands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Spaces_Coalition).","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2008.930499","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/4644043/04644050.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4644043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2008.930499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","startPage":"10","endPage":"198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Technology[Guest Editorial]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4644050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Technology[Guest Editorial]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4644050/","volume":"25","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Technology[Guest Editorial]","sourcePdf":"25msp06-guested.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054256S","chronDate":"November  2008","isNumber":"4644043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4644050","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4644052,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Budiarjo","affiliation":["University of Technology (TU Muenchen), Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Ibrahim Budiarjo (i.budiarjo@irctr.tudelft.nl) received his bachelor of engineering (Sarjana Teknik) degree in electronics from Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia, in 2001.

The regional spectrum allocation policy counteracts the free mobility of radio communication equipment. The vast majority of the available spectral resources have already been licensed, so it appears that there is little or no room to add any new services, unless some of the existing licenses are discontinued. Furthermore, recent studies and measurements have shown that vast portions of the licensed spectra are rarely used due to the inflexible spectrum regulations. The whole idea behind cognitive radio (CR) use is that it should prompt effective spectrum use, since intelligence and learning processes aid the radio system to access the spectrum effectively. The CR system has learning and understanding capabilities so that the stated goals may be achieved. In this article, we shall limit the scope of cognition to reduce mutual interference between CR-based rental (unlicensed) users (RUs) and licensed users (LUs) and in providing coexistence between them. It is expected that the rental users will be allowed to transmit and receive data over portions of spectra when primary (i.e., licensed) users are inactive. In this article, we will introduce the modulation strategies employed to realize a coexistence between the CR-based rental system and the licensed system. This is done in such a way that the RUs are invisible to the LUs. We consider the rental user accesses the unoccupied LU band in overlay fashion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4644052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4644052/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370664","volume":"25","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio modulation techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio modulation techniques","sourcePdf":"25msp06-budiarjo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055913S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4644043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4644043","articleId":"4644052","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4644053,"authors":[{"name":"Guosen Yue","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Guosen Yue (yueg@nec-Iabs.com) received the B.S. degree in physics and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nanjing University, China in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Texas A & M University in 2004.

Among these coding schemes, conventional RS codes are perfect in terms of erasure recovery performance.

In a CR network, secondary users continuously sense the spectral environment and adapt transmission parameters to opportunistically use the available spectrum. A fundamental problem for CRs is spectrum sensing; secondary users need to reliably detect weak primary signals of possibly different types over a targeted wide frequency band in order to identify spectral holes for opportunistic communications. Conceptually and practically, there is growing awareness that collaboration among several CRs can achieve considerable performance gains. This article provides an overview of the challenges and possible solutions for the design of collaborative wideband sensing in CR networks. It is argued that collaborative spectrum sensing can make use of signal processing gains at the physical layer to mitigate strict requirements on the radio frequency front-end and to exploit spatial diversity through network cooperation to significantly improve sensing reliability.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2008.929296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/4644043/04644055.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2008.929296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4644043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative wideband sensing for cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4644055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4644055/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative wideband sensing for cognitive radios","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10370667","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4644055/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative wideband sensing for cognitive radios","sourcePdf":"25msp06-quan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07769S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4644043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"262","xplore-issue":"4644043","articleId":"4644055","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4644056,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Beibei Wang (bebewang@umd.edu) received her B.S. degree in electrical engineering (with highest honor) from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in July 2004.

Our cognitive radio testbed is particularly suited for the development of physical and network layer functionalities and their experimental characterization in realistic wireless scenarios. Advanced testbed capabilities include real-time high-speed signal processing and protocol implementation, and support for multiple networks interaction and multiple antennas operation. This testbed is used for an experimental study of a set of prominent candidate techniques proposed in the literature for implementation of spectrum sensing functionality. We first consider three physical layer signal processing approaches based on energy, pilot, and feature detection. Our experimental results show that theoretical performance of these approaches for spectrum sensing cannot be achieved for the detection of very weak signals using a practical sensing receiver implementation. Also, we explain why these limitations exist by identifying sources of errors and provide basis for the design of robust spectrum sensing techniques. Next, we consider spectrum sensing techniques that use multiple measurements to improve sensing reliability. Our experimental study demonstrates practically achievable gains by exploiting multipath channel diversity through multiple antenna processing, and spatial diversity using user cooperation in a typical indoor environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4644057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370669","htmlLink":"/document/4644057/","displayDocTitle":"Addressing feasibility of cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Addressing feasibility of cognitive radios","sourcePdf":"25msp06-cabric.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051497S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4644043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4644043","articleId":"4644057","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4644058,"authors":[{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Petre Stoica (ps@it.uu.se) received the D.Sc. degree in automatic control from the Polytechnic Institute of Bucharest (BPI), Romania, in 1979 and an honorary doctorate degree in science from Uppsala University (UU), Sweden, in 1993.

After more than two centuries, we mathematicians, statisticians cannot only recognize our roots in this masterpiece of our science, we can still learn from it.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2008.929620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/4644043/04644060.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4644043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2008.929620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The variational approximation for Bayesian inference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4644060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"The variational approximation for Bayesian inference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4644060/","publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10390670","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4644060/","volume":"25","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The variational approximation for Bayesian inference","sourcePdf":"25msp06-tzikas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067664S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4644043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"435","xplore-issue":"4644043","articleId":"4644060","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4644067,"authors":[{"name":"Shuvra Bhattacharyya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shuvra S.

The idea is to overlay low-power and low-cost base station devices, Femto-APs, on the existing cellular network, where each Femto-AP provides high-speed wireless connection to subscribers within a small range. In particular, Femto-APs can be used to serve indoor users, resulting in a powerful solution for ubiquitous indoor and outdoor coverage, using a single access technology such as WiMAX. In this article we consider a WiMAX network deploying both macro BSs and Femto-APs, where it is assumed that Femto-APs have wired backhaul such as cable or DSL and operate on the same frequency band as macro BSs. Simulation results show that significant areal capacity (throughput per unit area) gain can be achieved via intense spatial reuse of the wireless spectrum. In addition, Femto-APs improve indoor coverage, where the macro BS signal may be weak. Motivated by the gains in capacity and coverage offered by femtocells, we review the state of the art of this \"infant\" technology, including use cases and network deployment scenarios, technical challenges that need to be addressed, and current standardization and industry activity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4644106/04644120.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"65","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2008.4644120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4644120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4644106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4644120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WiMAX femtocells: a perspective on network architecture, capacity, and coverage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Femtocells","Relays","Cellular networks","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Telephone sets","Roaming","Telecommunication traffic","IP networks","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiMAX","network architecture","network capacity","femtocells","cellular network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4644120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"WiMAX femtocells: a perspective on network architecture, capacity, and coverage","volume":"46","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4644120/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251562","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiMAX femtocells: a perspective on network architecture, capacity, and coverage","sourcePdf":"12YEH.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092202S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4644106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"4644106","articleId":"4644120","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4644135,"authors":[{"name":"David Kidston","affiliation":["Systems and computer engineering, Carleton University","Communications Research Centre, Canadian government research laboratory, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["David Kidston (david.kidston@cre.ca) received a B.Se. degree with honors from Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, in 1995 and a Master's in degree in mathematics from the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 1998, both for computer science.

Such networks are composed of a number of mobile wireless nodes typical of MANETs, but also have fixed (satellite) links and are continuously powered as is typical of fixed networks. Combined, these characteristics provide unique challenges not conducive to the use of existing MANET or fixed network management techniques. Since maritime units also operate in a low-bandwidth environment with varying communications capabilities, the efficiency of network management services is critical. Similarly, the lack of power constraints and slower mobility require a less dynamic solution than that required for MANETs. This article provides an overview of the maritime network management problem space including two key management opportunities provided by such an environment. The first opportunity is in automation. Maritime networks are subject to changing operational requirements, while at the same time suffering from limited availability of skilled network operators. To rapidly respond to faults and changes in performance needs, we propose the use of a serviceoriented policy-based management architecture on which a wide variety of management services can be rapidly deployed. The second key management opportunity is resource optimization. We suggest several management services that can be used to support traffic engineering. In our simulations traffic monitoring, traffic prioritization, adaptive routing, and resource reservation services were found to provide awareness and significantly improve the timeliness of prioritized flows.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2008.4644135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4644106/04644135.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4644135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4644106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges and opportunities in managing maritime networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4644135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4644135/","displayDocTitle":"Challenges and opportunities in managing maritime networks","volume":"46","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251572","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4644135/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges and opportunities in managing maritime networks","sourcePdf":"27KIDSTON.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036958S","chronDate":"October  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4644106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4644106","articleId":"4644135","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4648004,"authors":[{"name":"Chundan Lin","affiliation":["Maths & Physics Department, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chundan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37878480300"},{"name":"Guoqing Zhou","affiliation":["Information & Technology Department, Soongsil University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Guoqing Zhou","id":"37875960700"},{"name":"Taebo Shim","affiliation":["Information & Technology Department, Soongsil University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Taebo Shim","id":"37313358500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2143-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2144-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4648004","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency division multiplexing","Shape","Pulse shaping methods","Discrete Fourier transforms","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse shapes","OFDM systems","underwater acoustic communications","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","intercarrier interference"]}],"abstract":"Severe multipath propagation which results in frequency selective fading is one of the major obstacles for underwater acoustic (UWA) communications.

Three communications ports placed along the sides of each sensor sides allow communications with adjacent sensors. The tactile measurements are sent to embed microcontroller boards using serial bus communication links. The system can adaptively reduce its spatial resolution, improving the response time.

The employed order of the Taylor-series expansion and the number of components used for splitting allows balancing between accuracy and computational demand.

All the measurements inside the validation gate at the current sampling time are lined up in the order of the closeness to the predicted target measurement. Probability that the measurement is target-originated is evaluated for each measurement by utilizing order statistics. The measurement with the largest probability is selected to be target-originated and the measurement is used to update the state estimate with the probability used as a weighting factor of the filter gain. To accommodate the probabilistic nature of the MPDA algorithm, a filter structure is developed.

The modulation spectra of a speech signal are the power spectral density (PSD) functions of the feature trajectories generated from the signal, hence they describe the temporal structure of the features. The modulation spectra are distorted when the speech signal is corrupted by noise. We propose the temporal structure normalization (TSN) filter to reduce the noise effects by normalizing the modulation spectra to reference spectra. The TSN filter is different from other feature normalization methods such as the histogram equalization (HEQ) that only normalize the probability distributions of the speech features. Our previous work showed promising results of TSN on a small vocabulary Aurora-2 task. In this paper, we conduct an inquiry into the theoretical and practical issues of the TSN filter that includes the following. 1) We investigate the effects of noises on the speech modulation spectra and show the general characteristics of noisy speech modulation spectra. The observations help to further explain and justify the TSN filter. 2) We evaluate the TSN filter on the Aurora-4 task and demonstrate its effectiveness for a large vocabulary task. 3) We propose a segment-based implementation of the TSN filter that reduces the processing delay significantly without affecting the performance. Overall, the TSN filter produces significant improvements over the baseline systems, and delivers competitive results when compared to other state-of-the-art temporal filters.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2002082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4648209/04648211.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2002082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648209","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalization of the Speech Modulation Spectra for Robust Speech Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4648211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Normalization of the Speech Modulation Spectra for Robust Speech Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10289529","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4648211/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalization of the Speech Modulation Spectra for Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"16tasl08-xxiao-2002082.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115939S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4648209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4648209","articleId":"4648211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4648231,"authors":[{"name":"U.-H.

By taking into account the basic laws of underwater acoustic propagation, it is shown that unlike in the terrestrial radio systems, both the cell radius \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>\n and the reuse number \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n must satisfy a set of constraints to constitute an admissible solution (which sometimes may not exist).

The system capacity is defined as the maximal user density rho\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n that can be supported within a given bandwidth, and it is derived analytically. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the results. It is shown that capacity-achieving architectures are characterized by \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n, which grows with rho\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n. The capacity, as well as the range of admissible solutions, is heavily influenced by the choice of frequency region to which the bandwidth is allocated. Moving to a higher frequency region than that dictated by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization improves the SIR and yields a greater capacity. Although higher frequencies demand greater transmission power to span the same distance, they also imply a reduction in the cell size, which, in turn, provides an overall reduction in the transmission power. While complex relationships are involved in system optimization, the analysis presented offers a simple tool for the design of future ocean observation systems based on cellular types of network architecture for wide area coverage.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4663184/04648327.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2008.920210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2008.920210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4648327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Capacity Analysis of Cellular-Type Underwater Acoustic Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Bandwidth","Frequency","Cellular networks","Acoustic propagation","Network topology","Radio spectrum management","Signal to noise ratio","Design optimization","Oceans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","telecommunication network topology","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic networks","cellular underwater network","network topologies","user density","system bandwidth","signal-to-interference ratio","per-user bandwidth","signal-to-noise ratio","cell size","transmission power","system optimization","wide area coverage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular systems","network capacity","resource allocation","spatial reuse","underwater acoustic networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and Capacity Analysis of Cellular-Type Underwater Acoustic Networks","volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4648327/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10301420","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Capacity Analysis of Cellular-Type Underwater Acoustic Networks","sourcePdf":"33joe02-stojanovic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061525S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4663184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4663184","articleId":"4648327","onlineDate":"10 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4648354,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Ciresan","affiliation":["Computers Department, Politehnica University, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Ciresan","id":"37870586600"},{"name":"Dan Pescaru","affiliation":["Computers Department, Politehnica University, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Pescaru","id":"37545378000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2673-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4648354","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Neurons","Training","Artificial neural networks","NIST","Databases","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","handwritten character recognition","information retrieval","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten numeral strings","convolutional neural networks","postal code recognition","information extraction","character database","NIST SD 19"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4648354","abstract":"The objective of the present work is to provide an efficient and reliable technique for off-line recognition of handwritten numerals composed from two digits partially overlapped.

Many of these can be prevented. Therefore a driver assistance system must include a collision detection component that is capable of generating warnings to prevent an imminent impact and to advise the driver in the traffic scenarios. This paper presents a forward collision warning approach based on a 3D Elevation Map provided by a Dense Stereo Vision System.

The intersection of lines in the field model and input frame form feature points and by means of a genetic algorithm, we found the correspondence between those points.

The NN architecture is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with two inputs, three processing neurons in the hidden layer, and one output neuron. The amplified and filtered photoelectric signal provided by the rangefinder is set at one input. The NN is trained so that its output voltage is proportional to the distance for easy evaluation. By combining both measurements coming from the rangefinder and the NN, it is possible to obtain a resolution of 50 mum on a distance interval [0.5 m; 3.2 m], whereas the rangefinder measurement range width is limited to 0.9 m.

The RAMP approach enables simultaneous path and trajectory planning and simultaneous planning and execution of motion in real time. It facilitates real-time optimization of trajectories under various optimization criteria, such as minimizing energy and time and maximizing manipulability. It also accommodates partially specified task goals of robots easily. The approach exploits redundancy in redundant robots (such as locomotion versus manipulation in a mobile manipulator) through loose coupling of robot configuration variables to best achieve obstacle avoidance and optimization objectives. The RAMP approach has been implemented and tested in simulation over a diverse set of task environments, including environments with multiple mobile manipulators. The results (and also the accompanying video) show that the RAMP planner, with its high efficiency and flexibility, not only handles a single mobile manipulator well in dynamic environments with various obstacles of unknown motions in addition to static obstacles, but can also readily and effectively plan motions for each mobile manipulator in an environment shared by multiple mobile manipulators and other moving obstacles.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Motion planning","Mobile robots","Orbital robotics","Path planning","Trajectory","Intelligent robots","Buildings","Sampling methods","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","manipulators","mobile robots","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time adaptive motion planning","RAMP","mobile manipulators","dynamic environments","trajectory planning","redundant robots","simultaneous planning","real-time optimization","obstacle avoidance","optimization objectives","static obstacles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive","dynamic obstacles of unknown motion","loose coupling","mobile manipulators","partially specified goal","real time","redundant robots","trajectory optimization"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive","dynamic obstacles of unknown motion","loose coupling","mobile manipulators","partially specified goal","real time","redundant robots","trajectory optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.2003277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4663225/04648454.pdf","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.2003277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Adaptive Motion Planning (RAMP) of Mobile Manipulators in Dynamic Environments With Unforeseen Changes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4648454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Adaptive Motion Planning (RAMP) of Mobile Manipulators in Dynamic Environments With Unforeseen Changes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648454/","volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4648454/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10301460","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Adaptive Motion Planning (RAMP) of Mobile Manipulators in Dynamic Environments With Unforeseen Changes","sourcePdf":"tro-xiao-2003277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10959S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4663225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4663225","articleId":"4648454","onlineDate":"10 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":4648456,"authors":[{"name":"Kurt Konolige","affiliation":["Willow Garage, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA","University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4663225/4648456/4648456-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kurt Konolige received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 1984.","He is currently a Senior Researcher at Willow Garage, Menlo Park CA.

Coding efficiency depends strongly on the accuracy of this correlation estimation. While error in estimation is inevitable, the impact of estimation error on compression efficiency has not been sufficiently studied for the DSC problem. In this paper, we study correlation estimation subject to rate and complexity constraints, and its impact on coding efficiency in a DSC framework for practical distributed image and video applications. We focus on, in particular, applications where binary correlation models are exploited for Slepian-Wolf coding and sampling techniques are used to estimate the correlation, while extensions to other correlation models would also be briefly discussed. In the first part of this paper, we investigate the compression of binary data. We first propose a model to characterize the relationship between the number of samples used in estimation and the coding rate penalty, in the case of encoding of a single binary source. The model is then extended to scenarios where multiple binary sources are compressed, and based on the model we propose an algorithm to determine the number of samples allocated to different sources so that the overall rate penalty can be minimized, subject to a constraint on the total number of samples. The second part of this paper studies compression of continuous-valued data. We propose a model-based estimation for the particular but important situations where binary bit-planes are extracted from a continuous-valued input source, and each bit-plane is compressed using DSC. The proposed model-based method first estimates the source and correlation noise models using continuous-valued samples, and then uses the models to derive the bit-plane statistics analytically. We also extend the model-based estimation to the cases when bit-planes are extracted based on the significance of the data, similar to those commonly used in wavelet-based applications. Experimental results, including some based on hyperspectral image compression, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2004619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2004619","startPage":"2122","endPage":"2137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4648460/04648480.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-Based Correlation Estimation for Distributed Source Coding Under Rate and Complexity Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-Based Correlation Estimation for Distributed Source Coding Under Rate and Complexity Constraints","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10251610","pubMedId":"18972653","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4648480/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-Based Correlation Estimation for Distributed Source Coding Under Rate and Complexity Constraints","sourcePdf":"17tip11-ncheung-2004619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100439S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4648460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4648460","articleId":"4648480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4648788,"authors":[{"name":"Sandy Douglas","affiliation":["London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK"],"firstName":"Sandy","lastName":"Douglas","id":"37885241400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0164-1239"}],"articleNumber":"4648788","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4648788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computers","Differential equations","Information processing","Wave functions","History"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MAHC.1979.10018","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04648788.png","endPage":"99, 208","startPage":"98","publicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488650/4648785/04648788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1979.10018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Memories of EDSAC I: 1950-1952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April-June  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648788/","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April-June 1979","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Some Memories of EDSAC I: 1950-1952","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Memories of EDSAC I: 1950-1952","sourcePdf":"a2098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024349S","chronDate":"April-June  1979","isNumber":"4648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488650","articleId":"4648788","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4648790,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Randell","affiliation":["Computing Laboratory, University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Randell","id":"37266943400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0164-1239"}],"articleNumber":"4648790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":829},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4648790","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bibliographies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MAHC.1979.10016","endPage":"207","startPage":"101","publicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Annals of the History of Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488650/4648785/04648790.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1979.10016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Annotated Bibliography on the Origins of Digital Computers","abstract":"The bibliography contains nearly 750 annotated and indexed citations to papers, books, and other items relating to the origins of the modern electronic computer.

Whereas much attention has been focused on the development of efficient versions of affine projection algorithms for echo cancellation applications, the similar adaptive problem presented by active noise control (ANC) systems has not been studied so deeply. This paper is focused on the necessity to reduce even more the computational complexity of affine projection algorithms for real-time ANC applications. We present some alternative efficient versions of existing affine projection algorithms that do not significantly degrade performance in practice. Furthermore, while in the ANC context the commonly used affine projection algorithm is based on the modified filtered-x structure, an efficient affine projection algorithm based on the (nonmodified) conventional filtered-x structure, as well as efficient methods to reduce its computational burden, are discussed throughout this paper. Although the modified filtered-x scheme exhibits better convergence speed than the conventional filtered-x structure and allows recovery of all the signals needed in the affine projection algorithm for ANC, the conventional filtered-x scheme provides a significant computational saving, avoiding the additional filtering needed by the modified filtered-x structure. In this paper, it is shown that the proposed efficient versions of affine projection algorithms based on the conventional filtered-x structure show good performance, comparable to the performance exhibited by the efficient approaches of modified filtered-x affine projection algorithms, and also achieve meaningful computational savings. Experimental results are presented to validate the use of the algorithms introduced in the paper for practical applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Affine Projection Algorithms for Filtered-x Multichannel Active Noise Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2004295","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4648209/04648920.pdf","startPage":"1396","endPage":"1408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2004295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4648920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast Affine Projection Algorithms for Filtered-x Multichannel Active Noise Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4648920/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10289516","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Affine Projection Algorithms for Filtered-x Multichannel Active Noise Control","sourcePdf":"16tasl08-gonzalez-2004295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083417S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4648209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4648209","articleId":"4648920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4648922,"authors":[{"name":"Constantin Paleologu","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4648209/4648922/4648922-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Constantin Paleologu (M'07) was born in Romania in 1975.

However, an APA with a constant step-size parameter has to compromise between the performance criteria (1) and (2). Therefore, a variable step-size APA (VSS-APA) represents a more reliable solution.

It resolves ambiguities in TDOA estimation caused by multipath propagation and multiple sources. By exploiting two TDOA constraints, the raster condition and the zero cyclic sum condition, we are able to identify and reject the echo path TDOAs and to assign the direct path TDOAs correctly to different sources. For the latter purpose, an efficient algorithm for the synthesis of approximately consistent TDOA graphs has been developed. A real experiment demonstrates the superior performance of our algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2008","volume":"16","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10286334","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4648928/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Disambiguation of TDOA Estimation for Multiple Sources in Reverberant Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disambiguation of TDOA Estimation for Multiple Sources in Reverberant Environments","sourcePdf":"16tasl08-scheuing-2004533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08631S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4648209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4648209","articleId":"4648928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4648930,"authors":[{"name":"K.

For most voiced speech, the most significant excitation takes place around the instant of glottal closure. Extraction of epochs from speech is a challenging task due to time-varying characteristics of the source and the system. Most epoch extraction methods attempt to remove the characteristics of the vocal-tract system, in order to emphasize the excitation characteristics in the residual. The performance of such methods depends critically on our ability to model the system. In this paper, we propose a method for epoch extraction which does not depend critically on characteristics of the time-varying vocal-tract system. The method exploits the nature of impulse-like excitation. The proposed zero resonance frequency filter output brings out the epoch locations with high accuracy and reliability. The performance of the method is demonstrated using CMU-Arctic database using the epoch information from the electroglottograph as reference. The proposed method performs significantly better than the other methods currently available for epoch extraction. The interesting part of the results is that the epoch extraction by the proposed method seems to be robust against degradations like white noise, babble, high-frequency channel, and vehicle noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4648209/04648930.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2004526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2004526","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Epoch Extraction From Speech Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648930/","displayDocTitle":"Epoch Extraction From Speech Signals","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4648930/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10289523","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epoch Extraction From Speech Signals","sourcePdf":"16tasl08-murty-2004526.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061379S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4648209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"385","xplore-issue":"4648209","articleId":"4648930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4648942,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Nipissing University, North Bay, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4648937/4648942/4648942-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haibin Zhu (M'02\u2013SM'04) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Technology, Zhengzhou, China, in 1983 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Hunan, China, in 1988 and 1997, respectively.","He is an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Nipissing University, North Bay, ON, Canada.

The proposed algorithm combines the global but slow search of PSO with the rapid but local search capabilities of BB, to simultaneously achieve an improved optimization accuracy and a reduced requirement for computational resources. It is capable of handling arbitrary continuous and discrete constraints without the use of a penalty function, which is frequently cumbersome to parameterize. At the same time, it maintains a simple, generic, and easy-to-implement architecture, and it is based on the sequential quadratic programming for solving the NLP subproblems in the BB tree. The performance of the new hybrid PSO-BB architecture algorithm is evaluated against real-world MDNLP benchmark problems, and it is found to be highly competitive compared with existing algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Branch-and-Bound (HPB) Optimizer for Mixed Discrete Nonlinear Programming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2003536","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4648937/04648944.pdf","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2003536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4648944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Branch-and-Bound (HPB) Optimizer for Mixed Discrete Nonlinear Programming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4648944/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301987","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Branch-and-Bound (HPB) Optimizer for Mixed Discrete Nonlinear Programming","sourcePdf":"tsmca-goulermas-2003536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146817S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4648937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4648937","articleId":"4648944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4648946,"authors":[{"name":"Luigi Piroddi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4648937/4648946/4648946-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luigi Piroddi (M'07) was born in London, U.K., in 1966.

In the Petri net framework, deadlock prevention policies based on siphon control are often employed, since it is easy to specify generalized mutual exclusion constraints that avoid the emptying of siphons. However, such policies may require an excessive computational load and result in impractical oversized control subnets. This is often a consequence of the redundancy in the control conditions derived from siphons. In this paper, a novel method is proposed that provides small size controllers, based on a set covering approach that conveniently relates siphons and markings. Some examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and to compare it with other methods proposed in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2003535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2003535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648937","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4648937/04648946.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Petri nets","Size control","Flexible manufacturing systems","Iterative methods","Control systems","Communication system control","Batch production systems","Resource management","Automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","constraint theory","flexible manufacturing systems","Petri nets","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["selective siphon control","deadlock prevention","Petri net","flexible manufacturing system","generalized mutual exclusion constraint","small size controller","set covering approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deadlock prevention","flexible manufacturing systems","Petri nets","siphons"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Selective Siphon Control for Deadlock Prevention in Petri Nets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648946/","volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4648946/","accessionNumber":"10301989","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Siphon Control for Deadlock Prevention in Petri Nets","sourcePdf":"tsmca-piroddi-2003535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174248S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4648937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"4648937","articleId":"4648946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4648955,"authors":[{"name":"Stijn B.

An onboard pilot support system is needed that exploits travel freedom while maintaining spatial separation with other traffic. Ecological interface design is used to design an interface tool that assists pilots with the tactical planning of efficient conflict-free trajectories toward their destination. Desired pilot actions emerge from the visualization of workspace affordances in terms of a suitable description of aircraft (loco)motion. Traditional models and descriptions for aircraft motion cannot be applied efficiently for this purpose. Through functional modeling, more suitable locomotion models for trajectory planning are analyzed. As a result, a novel interface, the state vector envelope, is presented that is intended to provide the pilot with both low-level information, allowing direct action, and high-level information, allowing conflict understanding and situation awareness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4648937/04648955.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2001069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2001069","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ecological Interface Design of a Tactical Airborne Separation Assistance Tool","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4648955/","displayDocTitle":"Ecological Interface Design of a Tactical Airborne Separation Assistance Tool","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4648955/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10291374","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ecological Interface Design of a Tactical Airborne Separation Assistance Tool","sourcePdf":"tsmca-vandam-2001069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102504S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4648937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4648937","articleId":"4648955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4648957,"authors":[{"name":"Ziqian Liu","affiliation":["Engineering Department, Maritime College, State University of New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4648937/4648957/4648957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ziqian Liu received the Ph.D. degree from Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, in 2005.","From 1989 to 1999, he was with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China.

With the help of the Sontag's formula, one of two control laws is developed from the creation of a scalar function to eliminate a restriction requiring the same number of states and inputs. In addition, the proposed designs achieve global asymptotic stability and global inverse optimality with respect to some meaningful cost functional.

EEG (electroencephalogram) is widely used to monitor the brain condition. Frequency analysis method is given as general EEG analysis method. DR analysis is to evaluate the deviation ratio of power spectrum of arbitrary frequency band. On the other hand, neural networks are used to analyze nonlinear systems because of their ability to capture the dynamics of complex system. In this study, we propose the application of moving average-type neural networks (MANN) to analyze the EEG and compare the result of MANN analysis with the one of DR analysis. In this time, we used the randomness to optimize the number of input units of MANNs. In MANN analysis method, the measured EEG is divided into overlapped period 20 seconds. A MANN is trained to predict the EEG using three previous samples in each period. After training, the connecting weights of each MANN are compared using the inner product to evaluate changes in brain condition. We used measured EEG in closing/opening eyes to analyze. According to the results, the usefulness of MANN analysis was confirmed. And MANN analysis has possibility to be able to apply to analysis of the other EEG data or the other nonlinear systems.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649117","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649117.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"172","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG analysis using moving average-type neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"EEG analysis using moving average-type neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","pubMedId":"19162620","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4649117/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG analysis using moving average-type neural network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00440674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076777S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4649138,"authors":[{"name":"Mu-Huo Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mu-Huo","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37272480100"},{"name":"Li-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37880333600"},{"name":"Ying-Che Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Che","lastName":"Hung","id":"37872951100"},{"name":"Chang Ming Yang","affiliation":["Ming Young Biomedical Corporation, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chang Ming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404771500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1814-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1815-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"4649138","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Correlation","Wearable sensors","Real-time systems","Maximum likelihood estimation","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Clothing","Computer Systems","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electrocardiography, Ambulatory","Electrocardiography, Ambulatory","Heart Rate","Humans","Likelihood Functions","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Textiles","Transducers"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a real-time maximum-likelihood heart-rate estimator for ECG data measured via wearable textile sensors. The ECG signals measured from wearable dry electrodes are notorious for its susceptibility to interference from the respiration or the motion of wearing person such that the signal quality may degrade dramatically. To overcome these obstacles, in the proposed heart-rate estimator we first employ the subspace approach to remove the wandering baseline, then use a simple nonlinear absolute operation to reduce the high-frequency noise contamination, and finally apply the maximum likelihood estimation technique for estimating the interval of R-R peaks. A parameter derived from the byproduct of maximum likelihood estimation is also proposed as an indicator for signal quality. To achieve the goal of real-time, we develop a simple adaptive algorithm from the numerical power method to realize the subspace filter and apply the fast-Fourier transform (FFT) technique for realization of the correlation technique such that the whole estimator can be implemented in an FPGA system. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the viability of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649138","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649138.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time maximum-likelihood heart-rate estimator for wearable textile sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649138/","displayDocTitle":"A real-time maximum-likelihood heart-rate estimator for wearable textile sensors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19162641","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649138/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time maximum-likelihood heart-rate estimator for wearable textile sensors","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00650265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053512S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649140,"authors":[{"name":"Yongjian Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yongjian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37881038500"},{"name":"Masatake Akutagawa","affiliation":["University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatake","lastName":"Akutagawa","id":"37298659000"},{"name":"Masato Katayama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Katayama","id":"37290296700"},{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qinyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289942300"},{"name":"Yohsuke Kinouchi","affiliation":["University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohsuke","lastName":"Kinouchi","id":"37298662500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1814-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1815-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"4649140","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649140","abstract":"A novel filter is proposed by applying back propagation neural network (BPNN) ensemble where the noisy signal and the reference one are the same in a learning process.

A general technique, called frequency-modulated phase-interpolation (FMPI), is presented that preserves the time domain constraints. Results of FMPI in the synthesis of ECG signals with accurate event-interval reconstruction are shown. Discussion of the model against IPFM and the heart timing signal is presented.

The aortic valve (A2) usually closes before the pulmonary valve (P2) and the delay between these two events is known as \u201csplit\u201d and is typically less than 30 miliseconds. S2 splitting, reverse splitting or reverse occurrence of components A2 and P2 are the most important aspects regarding cardiac diagnosis carried out by the analysis of S2 cardiac sound. An automatic technique, based on discrete wavelet transform and hidden Markov models, is proposed in this paper to segment S2, to estimate de order of occurrence of A2 and P2 and finally to estimate the delay between these two components (split). A discrete density hidden Markov model (DDHMM) is used for phonocardiogram segmentation while embedded continuous density hidden Markov models are used for acoustic models, which allows segmenting S2. Experimental results were evaluated on data collected from five different subjects, using CardioLab system and a Dash family patient monitor. The ECG leads I, II and III and an electronic stethoscope signal were sampled at 977 samples per second.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649158","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649158.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","startPage":"334","endPage":"337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic segmentation of the second cardiac sound by using wavelets and hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic segmentation of the second cardiac sound by using wavelets and hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649158/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19162661","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4649158/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic segmentation of the second cardiac sound by using wavelets and hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00850653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046426S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649178,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Despite the different approaches, orthopedic surgeons routinely still acquire 2D X-ray radiographs for preoperative diagnostic and templating purposes. Such images provide detailed information in high resolution about the underlying anatomy. But lack of knowledge about the magnification factor of the bony structures complicates the correct interpretation of the real anatomy and therefore could lead to mismatching implants intraoperatively based on the preoperative performed planning. Therefore we developed a calibration device, which can be mounted within the usual clinical environment and allows to improve the accuracy of conventional radiographs by applying a specific calibration algorithm. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of reconstructing the surface of the proximal femur on the basis of two calibrated X-ray radiographs. The accuracy of this approach has been thoroughly validated using 14 dry cadaver femur bones (pathological as well as non-pathological cases), one plastic femur bone and one wet cadaver pelvis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calibration of X-ray radiographs and its feasible application for 2D/3D reconstruction of the proximal femur","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649192","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649192.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Calibration of X-ray radiographs and its feasible application for 2D/3D reconstruction of the proximal femur","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649192/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19162695","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calibration of X-ray radiographs and its feasible application for 2D/3D reconstruction of the proximal femur","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01190369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090152S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649214,"authors":[{"name":"Neil Joye","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratroy, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Joye","id":"37681445100"},{"name":"Alexandre Schmid","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratroy, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37276559400"},{"name":"Yusuf Leblebici","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratroy, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yusuf","lastName":"Leblebici","id":"37276561900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1814-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1815-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"4649214","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649214","keywords":[{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Animals","Computer Simulation","Computer-Aided Design","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Humans","Membrane Potentials","Microelectrodes","Models, Neurological","Neurons","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Surface Properties"]}],"abstract":"A point-contact model is presented, and an area-contact model has been analytically derived in order to model the electrical characteristic of the cell-electrode interface of high-density neuron cultures.

The goal of this research is to develop an interaction technique that will allow the BCI to be effective in real-world scenarios for hand grasp control. Moreover, for consistency of man-machine interface, it is desirable the intended movement to be what the subject imagines. For this purpose, we developed an on-line BCI which was based on the classification of EEG associated with imagination of the movement of hand grasping and resting state. A classifier based on probabilistic neural network (PNN) was introduced for classifying the EEG. The PNN is a feedforward neural network that realizes the Bayes decision discriminant function by estimating probability density function using mixtures of Gaussian kernels. Two types of classification schemes were considered here for on-line hand control: adaptive and static. In contrast to static classification, the adaptive classifier was continuously updated on-line during recording. The experimental evaluation on six subjects on different days demonstrated that by using the static scheme, a classification accuracy as high as the rate obtained by the adaptive scheme can be achieved. At the best case, an average classification accuracy of 93.0% and 85.8% was obtained using adaptive and static scheme, respectively. The results obtained from more than 1500 trials on six subjects showed that interactive virtual reality environment can be used as an effective tool for subject training in BCI.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649326","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649326.pdf","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1012","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-line BCI for control of hand grasp sequence and holding using adaptive probabilistic neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An on-line BCI for control of hand grasp sequence and holding using adaptive probabilistic neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","pubMedId":"19162829","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4649326/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-line BCI for control of hand grasp sequence and holding using adaptive probabilistic neural network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"02531228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055725S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4649358,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh R.

The processing of Electromyographic (EMG) signals can be viewed as the identification and separation of a series of overlapping sources of muscle activity with slowly varying source distribution and/or levels of activity. Blind source separation (BSS) techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) lend themselves well to the analysis of such problems. The problem, however, still remains largely ill-posed even through the use of powerful assumptions such as those posed in ICA and other such techniques. It is generally the case in EMG signals that a certain level of a priori knowledge is available on the spatio-temporal and/or frequency distribution of the activities of interest, based on neurophysiological expectations. Here we describe limitations and applications of BSS on surface EMG. The problems we consider include the analysis of facial sEMG recordings during vowel utterance and analysis of hand EMG during finger and wrist movements.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649358","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649358.pdf","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Addressing source separation and identification issues in surface EMG using blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649358/","displayDocTitle":"Addressing source separation and identification issues in surface EMG using blind source separation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19162861","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649358/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Addressing source separation and identification issues in surface EMG using blind source separation","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"02850571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044932S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4649363,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A fiducial peak point of BCG is an I-J-K complex which corresponds with ventricle contraction and Electrocardiogram (ECG) QRS complex. The goal of the method is extraction of J peak without ECG synchronization. The detection method is based on a \u201ctemplate matching\u201d rule evaluated using a correlation function in a local moving-window procedure. The total beat detection algorithm operates in two stages, template definition stage and beat detection stage with defined template in previous stage. In the first stage, the BCG template is constructed by the expert with an empirical analysis of BCG signal and measurement device. In the second stage, the correlation function calculates an accuracy of template with BCG signal using a local moving-window. The data analysis has been performed on the subjects tested at Seoul National University Hospital Sleep Medicine Center and presents 95.16% of sensitivity and 94.76% of positive predictivity value for the J peak detection.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649363","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649363.pdf","startPage":"1144","endPage":"1146","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic ballistocardiogram (BCG) beat detection using a template matching approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic ballistocardiogram (BCG) beat detection using a template matching approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","pubMedId":"19162866","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4649363/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic ballistocardiogram (BCG) beat detection using a template matching approach","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"02901186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050334S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4649365,"authors":[{"name":"Farideh Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farideh","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37570636400"},{"name":"Mohammad Mikaeili","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Mikaeili","id":"37573061400"},{"name":"Edson Estrada","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Texas, El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Edson","lastName":"Estrada","id":"37391881700"},{"name":"Homer Nazeran","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Texas, El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Homer","lastName":"Nazeran","id":"37329170200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1814-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1815-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"4649365","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":106,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2923},"keywords":[{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electroencephalography","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Oscillometry","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Sleep Stages"]}],"abstract":"Currently in the world there is an alarming number of people who suffer from sleep disorders. A number of biomedical signals, such as EEG, EMG, ECG and EOG are used in sleep labs among others for diagnosis and treatment of sleep related disorders. The usual method for sleep stage classification is visual inspection by a sleep specialist. This is a very time consuming and laborious exercise. Automatic sleep stage classification can facilitate this process. The definition of sleep stages and the sleep literature show that EEG signals are similar in Stage1 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Therefore, in this work an attempt was made to classify four sleep stages consisting of Awake, Stage1 + REM, Stage 2 and Slow Wave Stage based on the EEG signal alone. Wavelet packet coefficients and artificial neural networks were deployed for this purpose. Seven all night recordings from Physionet database were used in the study. The results demonstrated that these four sleep stages could be automatically discriminated from each other with a specificity of 94.4 \u00b1 4.5%, a of sensitivity 84.2+3.9% and an accuracy of 93.0 \u00b1 4.0%.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649365","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649365.pdf","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic sleep stage classification based on EEG signals by using neural networks and wavelet packet coefficients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649365/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic sleep stage classification based on EEG signals by using neural networks and wavelet packet coefficients","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19162868","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649365/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic sleep stage classification based on EEG signals by using neural networks and wavelet packet coefficients","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"02921207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055845S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649405,"authors":[{"name":"Hung T.

HypoMon is a non-invasive monitor that measures some physiological parameters continuously to provide detection of hypoglycemic episodes in Type 1 diabetes mellitus patients (T1DM). Based on heart rate and corrected QT interval of the ECG signal, we have continued to develop Bayesian neural network detection algorithms to recognize the presence of hypoglycemic episodes. From a clinical study of 16 children with T1DM, natural occurrence of nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes are associated with increased heart rates (1.033\u00b10.242 vs. 1.082\u00b10.298, P<0.06) and increased corrected QT intervals (1.031\u00b10.086 vs. 1.060\u00b10.084, P<0.001). The overall data were organized into a training set (8 patients) and a test set (another 8 patients) randomly selected.

Controversy still exists, however, over the precise physiological mechanism which is responsible for completely emptying the deep plantar veins of the foot. This study was designed to investigate whether weight bearing or muscular contraction was the dominant mechanism involved. This was achieved by comparing blood flow measurements taken from the posterior tibial and popliteal veins while performing specific foot exercises. Measurements were taken using Doppler ultrasound. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation was also used to study the blood flow obtained by artificially inducing contraction of the plantar venous plexus.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649430/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"pubMedId":"19162933","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4649430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A haemodynamic study of the physiological mechanisms of the venous pump in the healthy human foot","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A haemodynamic study of the physiological mechanisms of the venous pump in the healthy human foot","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"03570615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067266S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4649465,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Takizawa","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Kenichi Takizawa","id":"37087516493"},{"name":"Takahiro Aoyagi","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Takahiro Aoyagi","id":"37087641998"},{"name":"Jun-ichi Takada","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Jun-ichi Takada","id":"37087201074"},{"name":"Norihiko Katayama","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Norihiko Katayama","id":"37087641593"},{"name":"Kamya Yekeh","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), 3-4 Hikarino-oka, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, 2390847 Japan"],"lastName":"Kamya Yekeh","id":"37087686444"},{"name":"Yazdandoost Takehiko","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Yazdandoost Takehiko","id":"37087687308"},{"name":"Kobayashi Ryuji Kohno","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Kobayashi Ryuji Kohno","id":"37087686935"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1814-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1815-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"4649465","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1832},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency measurement","Wireless communication","Antenna measurements","Body area networks","Channel models","Position measurement","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Communication Networks","Electronics, Medical","Humans","Models, Theoretical","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Telemetry"]}],"abstract":"Wireless patient monitoring using wearable sensors is a promising application.

However, in the direct combination, the encoding matrix which represents the Fourier transform of channel-specific sensitivity modulation is not guaranteed to be a good CS matrix. In this paper, we propose a different approach that applies CS and SENSE sequentially. The method first uses CS to reconstruct a set of aliased images in each coil, and then applies the basic SENSE on these images to reconstruct the final image. The total reduction factor can achieve the product of the factors of each individual method. The experimental results show that overall performance of our proposed method is superior to the direct combination method with the same reduction factor.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649495.pdf","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1670","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating sensitivity encoding using Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","SENSE","MRI"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biomedical Engineering","Brain","Data Compression","Data Compression","Fourier Analysis","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Phantoms, Imaging","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating sensitivity encoding using Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649495/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19162998","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating sensitivity encoding using Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"04220693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072031S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4649496,"authors":[{"name":"Jim X.

Specifically, CS is used as a regularization method for the inverse problem raised by pMRI based on the L1 norm and a Total Variation (TV) term. We test the new method with a set of 8-channel, in-vivo brain MRI data at reduction factors from 2 to 8.

The pulse arrival time (PAT) approach might offer a suitable solution to enable comfortable BP monitoring even at beat-level. However, the methodology is based on hemodynamic surrogate measures, which are sensitive to patient activities such as posture changes, not necessarily related to blood pressure variations. In this paper, we analyze the impact of posture on the PAT measure and related hemodynamic parameters such as the pre-ejection period in well-defined procedures. Additionally, the PAT of a monitored subject is investigated in an unsupervised scenario illustrating the complexity of such a measurement. Our results show the failure of blood pressure inference based on simple calibration strategies using the PAT measure only. We discuss opportunities to compensate for the observed effects towards the realization of wearable cuff-less blood pressure monitoring. These findings emphasize the importance of accessing context information in personal healthcare applications, where vital sign monitoring is typically unsupervised.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649501","startPage":"1691","endPage":"1694","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649501.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous cuff-less blood pressure monitoring based on the pulse arrival time approach: The impact of posture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical monitoring","Blood pressure","Monitoring","Heart rate","Electrocardiography","Pressure measurement","Gravity"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Biomedical Engineering","Blood Pressure","Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory","Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory","Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Equipment Design","Female","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Posture","Pulse","Time Factors","Young Adult"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Continuous cuff-less blood pressure monitoring based on the pulse arrival time approach: The impact of posture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649501/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19163004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous cuff-less blood pressure monitoring based on the pulse arrival time approach: The impact of posture","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"04280579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058758S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4649507,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Yang","lastName":"Zhi Yang","id":"37538725400"},{"name":"Tung-Chien Chen","lastName":"Tung-Chien Chen","id":"37276681700"},{"name":"Wentai Liu","lastName":"Wentai Liu","id":"37279763700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1814-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1815-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"4649507","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Animals","Biomedical Engineering","Cats","Cerebral Cortex","Cerebral Cortex","Electrophysiological Phenomena","Models, Neurological","Neurons"]}],"abstract":"A spike derivative based feature extraction algorithm is reported in this paper.

However, disease progression can be limited if detected early. The optic cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) is one of the main clinical indicators of glaucoma, and is currently determined manually, limiting its potential in mass screening. In this paper, we propose an automatic CDR determination method using a variational level-set approach to segment the optic disc and cup from retinal fundus images. The method is a core component of ARGALI, a system for automated glaucoma risk assessment. Threshold analysis is used in pre-processing to estimate the initial contour. Due to the presence of retinal vasculature traversing the disc and cup boundaries which can cause inaccuracies in the detected contours, an ellipse-fitting post-processing step is also introduced. The method was tested on 104 images from the Singapore Malay Eye Study, and it was found the results produced a clinically acceptable variation of up to 0.2 CDR units from the manually graded samples, with potential use in mass screening.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649648","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649648.pdf","startPage":"2266","endPage":"2269","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Level-set based automatic cup-to-disc ratio determination using retinal fundus images in ARGALI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Level-set based automatic cup-to-disc ratio determination using retinal fundus images in ARGALI","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","pubMedId":"19163151","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4649648/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Level-set based automatic cup-to-disc ratio determination using retinal fundus images in ARGALI","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"05750318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049011S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4649653,"authors":[{"name":"Havard Kalvoy","affiliation":["Department of Clinical and Biomedical Engineering, Rikshospitalet HF, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Havard","lastName":"Kalvoy","id":"38243122800"},{"name":"Orjan G.

The sensor will be a two-dimensional array of micro-pixel avalanche photodiodes (MAPD). MAPDs are a new type of solid-state photodetector with Geiger mode operation that can provide signal gain similar to a photomltipiler tube (PMT). In addition, they can be operated in high magnetic fields to support PET/MR imaging. Utilizing a multi-step simulation process, we determined the intrinsic spatial resolution characteristics of a detector using the proposed design. For a 48.8 mm by 48.8 mm by 15 mm LSO crystal detector readout by an 8 by 8 array of 5.8 mm by 5.8 mm MAPD elements the intrinsic spatial resolution is 0.83 mm FWHM in X, 0.92 mm FWHM in Y and 1.83 mm FWHM in Z (i.e., DOI) for normally incident photons.

In this work, we present a spatiotemporal approach of facial expression recognition using image sequences. The system proposed in this paper describes fisher independent component analysis as a feature extractor where the higher order moment classification method (i.e., independent component analysis) is augmented with fisher linear discriminant. This procedure is simply abbreviated as FICA and produces the shape based spatial facial expression features. For recognition, we have utilized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to learn the obtained spatial features with the temporal dynamics in six different expressions. Our proposed approach for the first time deals with sequential images of emotion-specific facial expression data analyzed with FICA and recognized with HMM. Performance of our proposed system has been compared with four conventional approaches where principal component analysis, generic independent component analysis, enhanced independent component analysis, and augmented principal component analysis with linear discriminant analysis are utilized for feature extraction. Our preliminary results show that our proposed system yields much improved recognition rates reaching the mean recognition rate of 92.85%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"spatiotemporal human facial expression recognition using fisher independent component analysis and Hidden Markov Model","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649719","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649719.pdf","startPage":"2546","endPage":"2549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"spatiotemporal human facial expression recognition using fisher independent component analysis and Hidden Markov Model","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649719/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19163222","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"spatiotemporal human facial expression recognition using fisher independent component analysis and Hidden Markov Model","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"06460476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059384S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649752,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad.

From the results, it was achieved that the proposed prototype could do real time monitoring of ECG signal for arrhythmia detection. We also implemented algorithm in a sequential structure device like AVR microcontroller with 16 MHZ clock for the same purpose. External clock of FPGA is 50 MHZ and by utilizing of Phase Lock Loop (PLL) component inside device, it was possible to increase the clock up to 1.2 GHZ in internal blocks.

Simulation results show that the sample tracking algorithms significantly outperformed the conventional window-based algorithms in terms of bias and jitter when individual estimates from the samples are averaged over the same window length. Simulations further showed similar performance to that of recently introduced spline-based continuous time-delay estimators only if all the samples in the window had identical delays. When the samples inside a window experienced different delays, sample tracking algorithms considerably outperformed the continuous delay estimators. In addition, the sample tracking algorithms showed to have much higher resolution and sensitivity when compared to all the other window-based techniques, including the continuous delay estimators.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649828","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649828.pdf","startPage":"2976","endPage":"2979","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time delay estimation of discrete samples in ultrasound echo signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Time delay estimation of discrete samples in ultrasound echo signals","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4649828/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","pubMedId":"19163331","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649828/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time delay estimation of discrete samples in ultrasound echo signals","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"07550798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04592S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649837,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

The capsule endoscopic images possess vital information expressed by color and texture. This paper presents an approach based in the textural analysis of the different color channels, using the wavelet transform to select the bands with the most significant texture information. A new image is then synthesized from the selected wavelet bands, trough the inverse wavelet transform. The features of each image are based on second-order textural information, and they are used in a classification scheme using a multilayer perceptron neural network. The proposed methodology has been applied in real data taken from capsule endoscopic exams and reached 98.7% sensibility and 96.6% specificity. These results support the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649837","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649837.pdf","startPage":"3012","endPage":"3015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of small bowel tumors in capsule endoscopy frames using texture analysis based on the discrete wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649837/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of small bowel tumors in capsule endoscopy frames using texture analysis based on the discrete wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19163340","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649837/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of small bowel tumors in capsule endoscopy frames using texture analysis based on the discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"07640650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063453S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649862,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Situ","affiliation":[" Computer Science, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Situ","id":"37601854200"},{"name":"Xiaojing Yuan","affiliation":["Departments of Engineering Technology, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37596681700"},{"name":"Ji Chen","affiliation":["Departments of Engineering Technology, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Chen","id":"37880662100"},{"name":"George Zouridakis","affiliation":["Departments of Engineering Technology, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Zouridakis","id":"37426618100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1814-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1815-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"4649862","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"abstract":"In this paper, we apply a Bag-of-Features approach to malignant melanoma detection based on epiluminescence microscopy imaging.

Under the source statistical independence assumption, these problems can be solved by independent component analysis (ICA) methods. A simple ICA technique, referred to as RobustICA, has recently been proposed that shows interesting features such as very fast convergence, local-extrema escaping capabilities and the possibility of avoiding prewhitening. The present contribution explains how RobustICA can easily be modified to target particular sources according to their impulsive character as measured by the kurtosis sign. This new feature makes it possible to extract the sources of interest only, or a subspace thereof, with the subsequent reduction in computational complexity and error accumulation. The performance of this modification is illustrated on signal recordings issued from electrocardiography.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649921.pdf","startPage":"3344","endPage":"3347","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust independent component analysis for blind source separation and extraction with application in electrocardiography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Feature extraction","Blind source separation","Particle separators","Convergence","Biomedical measurement","Pollution measurement"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Automatic Data Processing","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Electrocardiography","Electrocardiography","Heart Conduction System","Humans","Models, Statistical","Models, Theoretical","Normal Distribution","Principal Component Analysis","Reproducibility of Results","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Time Factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust independent component analysis for blind source separation and extraction with application in electrocardiography","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649921/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19163424","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust independent component analysis for blind source separation and extraction with application in electrocardiography","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"08481190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041781S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4649931,"authors":[{"name":"Cornelius Brinegar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Cornelius","lastName":"Brinegar","id":"37373886600"},{"name":"Yi-Jen L.

In addition, a qualitative readout by visual tracking is more difficult as well. Non-rigid registration can be used to compensate for these movements in the image series. Because of the local contrast and intensity change over time, the registration criterion needs to be chosen carefully. We propose a measure based on Normalized Gradient Fields (NGF) in order to obtain registration. Since this measure requires strong gradients in the images, we also test combining the measure with the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) to maintain registration forces over the whole image area. To ensure smoothness, we employ a Laplacian regularizer and use the B-spline based approach to describe the transformation of the image space. Our experiments show that by using NGF good registration results can be obtained for image exhibiting a high intensity contrast. For images with a low intensity contrast, combining NGF and SSD improves the registration results significantly over using NGF only. Both measures are differentiable making possible the application of fast, gradient based optimizers.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649933","publicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4636107/4649055/04649933.pdf","startPage":"3389","endPage":"3392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4649055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new similarity measure for non-rigid breathing motion compensation of myocardial perfusion MRI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4649933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649933/","displayDocTitle":"A new similarity measure for non-rigid breathing motion compensation of myocardial perfusion MRI","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19163436","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649933/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new similarity measure for non-rigid breathing motion compensation of myocardial perfusion MRI","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"08601433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052442S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649939,"authors":[{"name":"Ho Chee Keong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Ho Chee Keong","id":"37087729352"},{"name":"Mehmet R.

Low data rate ultra wideband is currently under consideration for the newly formed wireless body area network (WBAN) group (IEEE802.15.6) to develop a standard for wireless vital sign monitoring. Maximizing the transmission power of the transmitter and reducing the stringent requirements and complexity of the receiver have always been the key considerations for an UWB transceiver. Multiple pulses per bit has been sent in our low data rate UWB prototype system to increase the transmitter power, to reduce the complexity of the receiver and to ease the requirement on the receiver's analog to digital converter. Non-coherent technique has been used for the demodulation of UWB signals at the receiver that reduces the receiver complexity further.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4649939/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","pubMedId":"19163442","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low data rate ultra wideband ECG monitoring system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low data rate ultra wideband ECG monitoring system","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"08661202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042198S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4649951,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang T.

Three neural networks are designed for three separate sub-tasks: passing through a door way, corridor and wall following and general obstacle avoidance. The accurate usable accessible space is determined by including the actual wheelchair dimensions in a real-time map used as inputs to each networks. Data acquisitions are performed separately to collect the patterns required for specified sub-tasks. Bayesian frame work is used to determine the optimal neural network structure in each case. Then these networks are trained under the supervision of Bayesian rule. Experiment results showed that compare to the VFH algorithm our neural networks navigated a smoother path following a near optimum trajectory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4649951/","isStaticHtml":true,"pubMedId":"19163454","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4649951/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","conferenceDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Advanced obstacle avoidance for a laser based wheelchair using optimised Bayesian neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced obstacle avoidance for a laser based wheelchair using optimised Bayesian neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"08780197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038055S","chronDate":"20-25 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4636107","isNumber":"4649055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4636107","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4649055","articleId":"4649951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
