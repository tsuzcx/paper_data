The system is subject to a known arbitrary input (control), a random input (additive driving noise), and the output observation is also contaminated by noise. The noises are Gaussian, zero mean, independent, and with known variances. The problem is formulated under the assumption that the system parameters are unknown constants. Previous works in the literature treated this problem either approximately or by assuming that each parameter can take values over a finite set with known a priori probabilities. An exact solution has been presented only for a scalar parameter. The proposed scheme yields the maximum likelihood estimates for the system's state and unknown parameters. They are obtained by solving the likelihood equations, a system of nonlinear equations with the state and parameters as unknowns. Use is made of the fact that the dynamical system considered is linear and the problem is separated into two interconnected linear problems: one for the state, the other for the parameters. The solution is obtained by iterating between two systems of linear equations. The estimation technique presented is optimal in the following sense. No approximations are involved and the estimates of the parameters converge to the true values at the fastest possible rate, as given by the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound, i.e., they are asymptotically efficient. This is proved, using a theorem which states that, under certain conditions, the maximum likelihood estimate with dependent observations is consistent and asymptotically efficient. The problem of uniqueness of the solution is discussed for the case of a scalar unknown parameter. Use is made of a theorem due to Perlman, generalized for the case of dependent observations. Due to the fact that the estimation-identification is done in the presence of input and output noise and an arbitrary known input, the procedure can be considered an on-line technique. Since estimates are available after each measurement, this estimation-identification procedure is suited for use in the adaptive control of unknown (or partially known) linear plants.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1100005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1972","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1972","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal simultaneous state estimation and parameter identification in linear discrete-time systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal simultaneous state estimation and parameter identification in linear discrete-time systems","sourcePdf":"01100005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034422S","chronDate":"Jun 1972","isNumber":"24125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"65","articleId":"1100005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1100031,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper an approximation that permits the explicit calculation of the a posteriori density from the Bayesian recursion relations is discussed and applied to the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem.

This paper gives the basic theoretical development of guaranteed cost control, and shows how it can be incorporated into an adaptive system. The uncertainty in system parameters is reduced first by either: 1) on-line measurement and evaluation, or 2) prior knowledge on the parametric dependence of a certain easily measured situation parameter. Guaranteed cost control is then used to take up the residual uncertainty. It is shown that the uncertainty in system parameters can be taken care of by an additional term in the Riccati equation.

It is also shown that almost any output feedback law will make the closed-loop system's poles be disjoint from any given finite set of points on the complex plane.

These results have immediate application in pole assignment, in the controllability of parallel-connected systems, and in the identification problem.

Performance bounds are derived in this series of papers for causal state estimation and regulation problems employing mean-square criteria. The systems considered are partially observed finite-dimensional continuous-time stochastic processes driven by additive white Gaussian noise. The particular systems to which the bounds apply are those which, when modeled by Ito differential equations, contain drift (.dt) coefficients which are, to within a uniformly Lipschitz residual, jointly linear in the system state and externally applied control. The bounds derived in the complete series of papers include both upper and lower bounds for causal state estimation and for a quadratic regulator problem. The upper bounds pertain to the performance of some simple, almost linear designs reminiscent of the designs which are optimal in the linear case. The lower bounds pertain to the optimum performance attainable within a broad class of candidate designs. This paper treats the upper bound for estimation. The second paper presents the estimation lower bound. The estimation performance bounds are independent of the control law, giving a particularly simple form to the control performance bounds which are developed in the third, and final, paper. All the bounds converge with vanishing nonlinearity (vanishing Lipschitz constants) to the known optimum performance for the limiting linear system. Consequently, the bounds are asymptotically tight and the simple designs studied are asymptotically optimal with vanishing nonlinearity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1100312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1973","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1973","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cone-bounded nonlinearities and mean-square bounds--Estimation upper bound","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cone-bounded nonlinearities and mean-square bounds--Estimation upper bound","sourcePdf":"01100312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038978S","chronDate":"Jun 1973","isNumber":"24131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1100312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1100349,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A total of six different control laws, which are functions of the sampled function, are derived from the generalized objective function by selecting different weighting coefficients. More than half of these control laws are identical to existing results. Similar control laws as functions of the system output can be derived as well. Also included are some experimental results on the performances of four representative control laws in a second-order system subject to step disturbance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1100455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1974","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1974","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analytic design of adaptive sampling control law in sampled-data systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic design of adaptive sampling control law in sampled-data systems","sourcePdf":"01100455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021347S","chronDate":"Feb 1974","isNumber":"24135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1100455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1100457,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In fact, it appears that many important processes, not only in engineering, but also in biology, socio-economics, and ecology, may be modeled by bilinear systems. Moreover, since their nonlinearity is due to products between input and state variables, this class frequently may be studied by techniques similar to those employed for linear systems. This work is intended to motivate the interest of bilinear systems and to present the current state of research in its various aspects. After an introductory section, in which theoretical and applicative aspects of bilinear systems are enlightened, four other sections follow, respectively, devoted to structural properties, mathematical models, identification and optimization. In a final section, some concluding remarks are made on still open problems and possible trends for future research.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Linear systems","Control systems","Computational biology","Biological system modeling","Linearity","Stochastic systems","Systems biology","Environmental factors","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bibliographies","Optimal control","System identification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.1974.1100617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24138/01100617.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1974.1100617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bilinear systems: An appealing class of \"nearly linear\" systems in theory and applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1100617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bilinear systems: An appealing class of \"nearly linear\" systems in theory and applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1100617/","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 1974","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1974","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilinear systems: An appealing class of \"nearly linear\" systems in theory and applications","sourcePdf":"01100617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127454S","chronDate":"Aug 1974","isNumber":"24138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"384","articleId":"1100617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1100652,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The concepts of optimality and input design are then discussed, followed by a derivation of the Fisher information matrix for multiinput multioutput systems with process noise. The design procedures are divided into the categories of time-domain methods and frequency-domain methods, with the former being more general, but also more time consuming (computationally). Several extensions to state constraints, continuous-time systems, etc., are discussed. A number of examples are given to illustrate the nature of optimal inputs.

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model).

Optimum parameter values in each of these models were obtained using standard parameter identification algorithms. The basic approach to model development was to derive the model structure using optimal control theory. The problem was formulated as a model-tracking problem and a quadratic cost function was minimized. Model parameters were optimized by comparing model behavior with freeway data obtained on Interstate 71 in Ohio by Clear and Treiterer. The results indicate that the models fit the data very well during acceleration and deceleration phases, but not during constant velocity regions. To obtain a better fit during transitions between acceleration and deceleration phases, a second model was postulated based on the hypothesis that the driver tracks not only the car directly in front of him, but also cars directly ahead of the lead car. An adaptive controller structure with a mode switching algorithm has been derived and its parameters optimized.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1100740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1974","publicationDate":"December 1974","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"19","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Identification of human driver models in car following","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of human driver models in car following","sourcePdf":"01100740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038742S","chronDate":"Dec 1974","isNumber":"24140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1100740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1100741,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The estimator gives an upper bound to the error for any allowed system parameter variation. A dynamic system is considered where the uncertainty in initial state, additive plant disturbance measurement errors are modeled aS unknown but bounded (UBB). It is further assumed that there is a UBB uncertainty in the system parameters. The estimation problem for a nonlinear system with parameter uncertainty is first formulated as a constrained optimization problem and then using fuzzy dynamic programming the class of bounding estimators is derived. The results are applied to obtain a linear estimator for linear uncertain system. It is shown that such an estimator is precomputable and that it reduces to the optimum filter for a linear system with additive disturbances as the model uncertainty vanishes.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1975.1100926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24147/01100926.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1975.1100926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guaranteed error estimation in uncertain systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1100926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1100926/","displayDocTitle":"Guaranteed error estimation in uncertain systems","volume":"20","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1975","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guaranteed error estimation in uncertain systems","sourcePdf":"01100926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103633S","chronDate":"Apr 1975","isNumber":"24147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"51","articleId":"1100926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1100953,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In addition, it is also assumed in the feedforward controller case, that the disturbance inputs can be measured and be excited; this assumption is not required in the robust feedback controller case. Necessary and sufficient conditions which allow the robust feedforward-feedback compensator to be synthesized so that the controlled system is stable and so that asymptotic tracking, in the presence of both measurable and unmeasurable disturbances, occurs are obtained.

In this problem, the class of plant parameter perturbations allowed is quite large; in particular, any perturbations in the plant data are allowed as long as the resultant closed-loop system remains stable. A complete characterization of all such robust controllers is made. It is shown that any robust controller must consist of two devices 1) a servocompensator and 2) a stabilizing compensator. The servocompensator is a feedback compensator with error input consisting of a number of unstable subsystems (equal to the number of outputs to be regulated) with identical dynamics which depend on the disturbances and reference inputs to the system. The sorvocompensator is a compensator in its own right, quite distinct from an observer and corresponds to a generalization of the integral controller of classical control theory. The sole purpose of the stabilizing compensator is to stabilize the resultant system obtained by applying the servocompensator to the plant. It is shown that there exists a robust controller for \"almost all\" systems provided that the number of independent plant inputs is not less than the number of independent plant outputs to be regulated, and that the outputs to be regulated are contained in the measurable outputs of the system; if either of these two conditions is not satisfied, there exists no robust controller for the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24152/01101137.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1976.1101137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1976.1101137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1101137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The robust control of a servomechanism problem for linear time-invariant multivariable systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Servomechanisms","MIMO","Control systems","Sufficient conditions","Output feedback","Control theory","Equations","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linear systems, time-invariant continuous-time","Servosystems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1976","displayDocTitle":"The robust control of a servomechanism problem for linear time-invariant multivariable systems","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The robust control of a servomechanism problem for linear time-invariant multivariable systems","sourcePdf":"01101137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106042S","chronDate":"Feb 1976","isNumber":"24152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"889","articleId":"1101137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":1101138,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Necessary and sufficient conditions, together with a characterization of all decentralized robust controllers which enables asymptotic tracking to occur, independent of disturbances in the plant and perturbations in the plant parameters, and gains of the system, are obtained. A new type of compensator called a decentralized sercocompensator which is quite distinct from an observer is introduced. It is shown that this compensator, which corresponds to an integral controller in classical control theory, must be used in any decentralized servomechanism problem to assure that the controlled system is stabilizable and achieves robust control; in particular, it is shown that a decentralized robust controller of a general servomechanism problem consists of two devices 1) a decentralized servocompensator and 2) a decentralized stabilizing compensator. It is then shown that, under certain mild conditions, there almost always is a solution to the robust decentralized servomechanism problem for any composite system consisting of a number of subsystems interconnected in any arbitrary manner. This last observation has important implications for process control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24152/01101138.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1976.1101138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1976.1101138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1101138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The robust decentralized control of a general servomechanism problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Distributed control","Servomechanisms","Control systems","Robustness","Centralized control","Interconnected systems","Adaptive control","Control theory","Power system interconnection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Decentralized control","Linear systems, time-invariant continuous-time","Servosystems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1976","displayDocTitle":"The robust decentralized control of a general servomechanism problem","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The robust decentralized control of a general servomechanism problem","sourcePdf":"01101138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033035S","chronDate":"Feb 1976","isNumber":"24152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"166","articleId":"1101138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1101139,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These rules are similar in spirit to the efficient Armijo rule for the method of steepest descent and under mild assumptions they have the desirable property that they identify the set of active inequality constraints in a finite number of iterations. As a result the method may be converted towards the end of the process to a conjugate direction, quasi-Newton or Newton's method, and achieve the attendant superlinear convergence rate. As an example we propose some quadratically convergent combinations of the method with Newton's method. Such combined methods appear to be very efficient for large-scale problems with many simple constraints such as those often appearing in optimal control.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1976.1101194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24153/01101194.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1976.1101194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1101194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Goldstein-Levitin-Polyak gradient projection method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1976","displayDocTitle":"On the Goldstein-Levitin-Polyak gradient projection method","volume":"21","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Goldstein-Levitin-Polyak gradient projection method","sourcePdf":"01101194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047164S","chronDate":"April  1976","isNumber":"24153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"370","articleId":"1101194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1101195,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In all these situations, any workable control strategy most take into account the true multivariable nature of the plant and address itself directly to the design of a compatible multivariable controller. Any practical design technique most be able to cope with load disturbance, plant saturation, measurement noise, process lag, sensitivity and also incorporate suitable criteria delimiting transient behavior and steady-state performance. These difficulties, when compounded by the fact that many plants (such as chemical reactors) are inherently open-loop unstable have hindered the development of an inclusive frequency-domain analytic design methodology. However, a solution based on a least-square Wiener-Hopf minimization of an appropriately chosen cost functional is now available. The optimal controller obtained by this method guarantees an asymptotically stable and dynamical closed-loop configuration irrespective of whether or not the plant is proper, stable, or minimum-phase and also permits the stability margin of the optimal design to be ascertained in advance. The main purpose of this paper is to lay bare the physical assumptions underlying the choice of model and to present an explicit formula for the optimal controller.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1976.1101223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24154/01101223.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1976.1101223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modern Wiener-Hopf design of optimal controllers--Part II: The multivariable case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1101223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101223/","displayDocTitle":"Modern Wiener-Hopf design of optimal controllers--Part II: The multivariable case","volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1976","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modern Wiener-Hopf design of optimal controllers--Part II: The multivariable case","sourcePdf":"01101223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054643S","chronDate":"Jun 1976","isNumber":"24154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"965","articleId":"1101223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1101230,"authors":[{"name":"R.

First, a path-dependent coordinate system for describing vehicle motion is defined, and the availability of motion quantities for control purposes is specified. Second, the lateral dynamics of a typical U.S. passenger sedan are empirically obtained and validated with data from full-scale studies. Third, various designs, in which different types of compensation are employed, are evaluated in terms of specified requirements and attractive candidates are specified. Finally, several controller designs were tested under full-scale conditions wherein a wire-reference configuration and a dual-mode test vehicle were employed. The latter was automatically steered on both straight and curving roads at speeds up to 35.8 m/s (80 mph). In one typical case, the maximum tracking error observed was 0.0635 m and occurred both when a sidewind was present and when the vehicle entered a curving section of roadway. Excellent lateral control-close tracking, good insensitivity to disturbance forces, and a comfortable ride-can be obtained using a relatively simple controller.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1976.1101230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24154/01101230.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1976.1101230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"306","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the steering of automated vehicles: Theory and experiment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1101230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1976","displayDocTitle":"On the steering of automated vehicles: Theory and experiment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101230/","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the steering of automated vehicles: Theory and experiment","sourcePdf":"01101230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044864S","chronDate":"Jun 1976","isNumber":"24154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"109","articleId":"1101230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1101259,"authors":[{"name":"R.

One interesting feature is that the distribution of a mode among the output components can be varied even if the mode is not controllable.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1976.1101355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24156/01101355.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1976.1101355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the flexibility offered by state feedback in multivariable systems beyond closed loop eigenvalue assignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1101355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101355/","displayDocTitle":"On the flexibility offered by state feedback in multivariable systems beyond closed loop eigenvalue assignment","volume":"21","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 1976","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the flexibility offered by state feedback in multivariable systems beyond closed loop eigenvalue assignment","sourcePdf":"01101355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03401S","chronDate":"Oct 1976","isNumber":"24156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"423","articleId":"1101355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1101357,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper,[1] it is shown that the effects of dither depend on its amplitude distribution function. The stability of a dithered system is related to that of an equivalent smoothed system, whose nonlinear element is the convolution of the dither distribution and the original nonlinearity. The ability of dithers to stabilize large classes of nonlinear systems is explained in terms of an effective narrowing of the nonlinear sector. A feature of the approach taken here is that a deterministic (i.e., strong) concept of stability is established under probabilistic (i.e., weak) assumptions on the dither.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1976","volume":"21","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dither in nonlinear systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dither in nonlinear systems","sourcePdf":"01101357.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027913S","chronDate":"Oct 1976","isNumber":"24156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"95","articleId":"1101357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1101363,"authors":[{"name":"Tze-Thong Chen","affiliation":["Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Incorporated, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Tze-Thong Chen","id":"37086971029"},{"name":"M.

This short paper presents an FDI system whose design criterion is the minimization of the mean time to detect system failures subject to constraints on false-and miss-alarm error probabilities. The cost of missed failure is measured by system performance degradation, while the loss of unfailed components due to false alarm is unacceptable for practical levels of redundancy. An on-line recursive FDI technique is developed through an application of sequential analysis and information feedback. The feedback control is derived by utilization of a monotonicity property of the performance. The analytical performance in terms of mean detection and isolation time is presented. This sequential FDI technique is applied to the problem of second sensor failure isolation to provide fall operational-fail safe capability to the space shuttle's redundant inertial reference units.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1976.1101363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24156/01101363.pdf","startPage":"750","endPage":"757","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1976.1101363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sequential failure detection technique and its application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1976","displayDocTitle":"A sequential failure detection technique and its application","volume":"21","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sequential failure detection technique and its application","sourcePdf":"01101363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032167S","chronDate":"Oct 1976","isNumber":"24156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1101363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1101406,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The decision rule answers a wide variety of questions such as the advisability of a nonlinear transformation of data, the limitations of a model which yields a perfect fit to the data (i.e., zero residual variance), etc. The method can be used not only to compare different types of structures but also to determine a reliable estimate of spectral density of process.

In an example, the resulting combined detector-estimator is shown to increase the estimation accuracy in the incremental minimax sense by a factor of two over the standard minimax estimator.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1977.1101602","startPage":"821","endPage":"825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1977.1101602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24162/01101602.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust state estimation in uncertain systems: Combined detection-estimation with incremental MSE criterion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101602/","displayDocTitle":"Robust state estimation in uncertain systems: Combined detection-estimation with incremental MSE criterion","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1977","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1977","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust state estimation in uncertain systems: Combined detection-estimation with incremental MSE criterion","sourcePdf":"01101602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035938S","chronDate":"Oct 1977","isNumber":"24162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1101602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1101619,"authors":[{"name":"W.

For Lyapunov stability, it is assumed that the system can be broken down into a number of subsystems, and that for each subsystem one can find a Lyapunov function (or something akin to a Lyapunov function). The alternative approach is an input-output approach; stability criteria are derived by assuming that each subsystem has finite gain. The input-output method has also been applied to interconnections of passive and of conic subsystems. This paper attempts to unify many of the previous results, by studying linear interconnections of so-called \"dissipative\" subsystems. A single matrix condition is given which ensures both input-output stability and Lyapunov stability. The result is then specialized to cover interconnections of some special types of dissipative systems, namely finite gain systems, passive systems, and conic systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24165/01101721.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1978.1101721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1978.1101721","startPage":"143","endPage":"149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability criteria for large-scale systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101721/","displayDocTitle":"Stability criteria for large-scale systems","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability criteria for large-scale systems","sourcePdf":"01101721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079926S","chronDate":"Apr 1978","isNumber":"24165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"275","articleId":"1101721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1101726,"authors":[{"name":"F.

These situations are of importance, especially to above-elbow upper-extremity amputees. Here, classical EMG (myoelectric) controllers have failed in the past, since they were based on only determining existence or nonexistence of an EMG signal. Recent work by Lyman et al. at UCLA has approached this multifunctional (MF) control problem via using a large number of electrodes, though still considering only a limited part of the EMG spectrum. The present approach is based on earlier work by Graupe et al. [4], considering the whole spectrum of the EMG signal via identifying its time series model such that several limb functions can be controlled from a single signal site. However, the present work subsequently employs parallel filtering to discriminate between the various limb functions of interest to achieve fast discrimination and control as required for practical applications, since this allows the identification itself to be performed off line. Real-time on-line results are presented in the paper, as recently obtained from tests carried out on a 1969 Vietnam above-elbow amputee who had most severe (90 percent) nerve and muscle loss at his stump, and could therefore not use more than one or two electrode pairs. The results, where complete discrimination was achieved within 0.15 to 0.2 seconds using 8-bit Intel 8080 microprocessors at double precision (incorporating hardware multipliers), have yielded an 85 percent success rate in discrimination between four to five limb functions using a single electrode pair. It is noted that the amputee mentioned had no previous EMG actuation training whatsoever.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1978.1101783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24167/01101783.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1978.1101783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24167","startPage":"538","endPage":"544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A microprocessor system for multifunctional control of upper-limb prostheses via myoelectric signal identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1101783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A microprocessor system for multifunctional control of upper-limb prostheses via myoelectric signal identification","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1978","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 1978","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microprocessor system for multifunctional control of upper-limb prostheses via myoelectric signal identification","sourcePdf":"01101783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049368S","chronDate":"Aug 1978","isNumber":"24167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"116","articleId":"1101783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1101790,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

By introducing a way of classifying stochastic processes in terms of an \"index of nonstationarity\" we derive extended LWR algorithms for nonstationary processes We show also how adding state-space structure to the covariance matrix allows us to specialize these general results to state-space type estimation algorithms.

The control force distribution is provided by a number of point force actuators and the system displacements and/or their velocities are measured at various points. A feedback controller is developed for a finite number of modes of the flexible system and the controllability and observability conditions necessary for successful operation are displayed. The control and observation spillover due to the residual (uncontrolled) modes is examined and the combined effect of control and observation spillover is shown to lead to potential instabilities in the closed-loop system. Some remedies for spillover, including a straightforward phase-locked loop prefilter, are suggested to remove the instability mechanism. The concepts of this paper are illustrated by some numerical studies on the feedback control of a simply-supported Euler-Bernoulli beam with a single actuator and sensor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1101798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1978","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1978","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Feedback control of flexible systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback control of flexible systems","sourcePdf":"01101798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032254S","chronDate":"Aug 1978","isNumber":"24167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"600","articleId":"1101798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1101800,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The methods are based on a comparison between the measured outputs and the outputs of a candidate model. Depending on the set of models that is used, such methods are known under a variety of names, like output-error methods, equation-error methods, maximum-likelihood methods, etc. General results are proved concerning the models that are selected asymptotically as the number of observed data tends to infinity. For these results it is not assumed that the true system necessarily can be exactly represented within the chosen set of models. In the particular case when the model set contains the system, general consistency results are obtained and commented upon. Rather than to seek an exact description of the system, it is usually more realistic to be content with a suitable approximation of the true system with reasonable complexity properties.

Algorithms for computation of the necessary feedback gains in the vicinity of the operating point are discussed. For a three-link biped model, several motions in the vicinity of the vertical stance are considered, and the necessary feedback gains are derived. Digital computer simulation of some biped motions are carried out to serve as examples and to demonstrate use of the theory.

It is shown that in case of systems with delays in control only the problem is solvable if and only if some function space controllability criterion is met. The solution is then easily obtainable by standard spectrum assignment methods, while the resulting feedback law involves integrals over the past control. In case of delays in state variables it is shown that a technique based on the finite Laplace transform, related to a recent work on function space controllability, leads to a constructive design procedure. The resulting feedback consists of proportional and (finite interval) integral terms over present and past values of state variables. Some indications on how to combine these results in case of systems including both state and control delays are given. Sensitivity of the design to parameter variations is briefly analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1979.1102124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24173/01102124.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1979.1102124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1102124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite spectrum assignment problem for systems with delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite spectrum assignment problem for systems with delays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1979","volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite spectrum assignment problem for systems with delays","sourcePdf":"01102124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041557S","chronDate":"August  1979","isNumber":"24173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"799","articleId":"1102124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":1102164,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The criterion is a function of the Fisher information matrix, the inverse of which gives a lower bound for the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. Emphasis is placed on optimum design of nonuniform data sampling intervals when experimental constraints allow only a limited number of discrete-time measurements of the output. A solution algorithm based on a steepest descent strategy is developed and applied to the design of a biologic experiment for estimating the parameters of a model of the dynamics of thyroid hormone metabolism. The effects on parameter accuracy of different model representations are demonstrated numerically, a canonical representation yielding far poorer accuracies than the original process model for nonoptimal sampling schedules, but comparable accuracies when these schedules are optimized. Several objective functions for optimization are compared. The overall results indicate that sampling schedule optimization is a very fruitful approach to maximizing expected parameter estimation accuracies when the sample size is small.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1979.1102175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1979.1102175","startPage":"893","endPage":"900","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24175/01102175.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal nonuniform sampling interval and test-input design for identification of physiological systems from very limited data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1979","displayDocTitle":"Optimal nonuniform sampling interval and test-input design for identification of physiological systems from very limited data","publicationDate":"December 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102175/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal nonuniform sampling interval and test-input design for identification of physiological systems from very limited data","sourcePdf":"01102175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030858S","chronDate":"Dec 1979","isNumber":"24175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"54","articleId":"1102175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":1102177,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The algorithm is capable of initiating tracks, accounting for false or missing reports, and processing sets of dependent reports. As each measurement is received, probabilities are calculated for the hypotheses that the measurement came from previously known targets in a target file, or from a new target, or that the measurement is false. Target states are estimated from each such data-association hypothesis using a Kalman filter. As more measurements are received, the probabilities of joint hypotheses are calculated recursively using all available information such as density of unknown targets, density of false targets, probability of detection, and location uncertainty. This branching technique allows correlation of a measurement with its source based on subsequent, as well as previous, data. To keep the number of hypotheses reasonable, unlikely hypotheses are eliminated and hypotheses with similar target estimates are combined. To minimize computational requirements, the entire set of targets and measurements is divided into clusters that are solved independently. In an illustrative example of aircraft tracking, the algorithm successfully tracks targets over a wide range of conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102177/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1979","volume":"24","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"December 1979","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An algorithm for tracking multiple targets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithm for tracking multiple targets","sourcePdf":"01102177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022076S","chronDate":"Dec 1979","isNumber":"24175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"1711","articleId":"1102177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1102178,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The filter separately estimates the translational position changes of the target in the FLIR field of view due to two effects: actual target motion and apparent motion caused by atmospheric turbulence. A Monte Carlo analysis is conducted to determine the performance of the filter as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, target spot size, the ratio of rms target motion to rms atmospheric jitter, target correlation times, and mismatches between the true target spot size and the size assumed by the filter. The performance of the extended Kalman filter is compared to the performance of an existing correlation tracker under identical conditions. A one sigma tracking error of 0.2 and 0.8 picture elements is obtained with signal-to-noise ratios of 20:1 and 1:1, respectively. No degradation in performance is observed when the spot size is decreased or when the target correlation time is increased over a limited range, when filter parameters are adjusted to reflect this knowledge. Sensitivity analysis shows that the filter is robust to minor changes in target intensity spot size.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1980.1102284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24177/01102284.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1980.1102284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A target tracker using spatially distributed infrared measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1102284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102284/","displayDocTitle":"A target tracker using spatially distributed infrared measurements","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A target tracker using spatially distributed infrared measurements","sourcePdf":"01102284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031462S","chronDate":"Apr 1980","isNumber":"24177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1102284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1102316,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This problem is well known under the major assumption: the system is minimum (or maximum!) phase, in which the very popular least squares method gives an identification of the system in an autoregressive form. However, we are Interested in the case where the system is nonminimum (nor maximum!) phase, i.e., we want identification of both gain and phase of the system. The literature gives only a negative result: the idenfication of the phase of the system is impossible in the case of a Gaussian driving noise (hence, second-order statistics are irrelevant to our problem).

Since the manipulator is a nonlinear system whose joints are highly coupled, it is very difficult to control. This paper presents a technique which adopts the idea of \"inverse problem\" and extends the results of \"resolved-motion-rate\" controls. The method deals directly with the position and orientation of the hand. It differs from others in that accelerations are specified and that all the feedback control is done at the hand level. The control algorithm is shown to be asymptotically convergent. A PDP 11/45 computer is used as part of a controller which computes the input torques/forces at each sampling period for the control system using the Newton-Euler formulation of equations of motion. The program is written in floating point assembly language, and has an average execution time of less than 11.5 ms for a Stanford manipulator. This makes a sampling frequency of 87 Hz possible. The controller is verified by an example which includes a simulated manipulator.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1980.1102367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24178/01102367.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1980.1102367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resolved-acceleration control of mechanical manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1980","displayDocTitle":"Resolved-acceleration control of mechanical manipulators","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resolved-acceleration control of mechanical manipulators","sourcePdf":"01102367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075707S","chronDate":"Jun 1980","isNumber":"24178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"864","articleId":"1102367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1102373,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The algorithm may be applied to linear controllers of arbitrary structure with any degree of decentralization in the distribution of information. Most important, it is not necessary to provide an initial controller of the specified structure which stabilizes the system. Rather, the structural constraints are initially relaxed to whatever degree necessary to obtain a stabilizating controller. agorithm then gradually restores the constraints, converges to a local optimum solution, when one exists, and stabilizes any open-loop system possessing a controllable unstable subspace. The necessary conditions which the optimum parameters must satisfy are developed for the arbitrarily constrained controller. The method of satisfying these necessary conditions involves use of a standard conjugate direction search together with a combined multiplier and penalty method for invoking the structural constraints. While attention is focused on the deterministic control problem, it is noted that systems with driving disturbances and measurement uncertainty may be handled with no significant modification of the algorithm. The result is a very practical tool for system design via parameter optimization.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1980.1102373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24178","startPage":"496","endPage":"500","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24178/01102373.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter optimization in linear systems with arbitrarily constrained controller structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1980","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parameter optimization in linear systems with arbitrarily constrained controller structure","publicationDate":"June 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter optimization in linear systems with arbitrarily constrained controller structure","sourcePdf":"01102373.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04178S","chronDate":"Jun 1980","isNumber":"24178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"65","articleId":"1102373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1102374,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In this hierarchical form, each subsystem interacts only with \"lower\" subsystems but not with \"higher\" subsystems. Once the system equations have been rearranged in this hierarchical form, we show that the overall system is uniformly asymptotically stable (respectively exponentially stable, globally exponentially stable) if and only if each of the subsystems is uniformly asymtotically stable (respectively exponentially stable, globally exponentially stable). The main technique used to do this is the converse Lyapunov theory. We then turn to problems of stabilizability, and show that, once the system equations have been arranged in hierarchical form, the overall system can be stabilized by a decentralized control law if and only if each of the subsystems can be stabilized.

We present the concept of almost sure exponential convergence of the homogeneous difference equations as an a priori testable robustness property guaranteeing satisfactory performance in practice. For the three particular algorithms discussed, we present very mild conditions for the satisfaction of this property, and thus explain much of their observed behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102433/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1980","volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of adaptive estimation algorithms in dependent random environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of adaptive estimation algorithms in dependent random environments","sourcePdf":"01102433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049758S","chronDate":"Aug 1980","isNumber":"24179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"104","articleId":"1102433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1102445,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The method of design is based on using state space methods via a two-stage process: 1) using theory, determine the existence of a solution and control structure required to solve the problem, and 2) using nonlinear programming methods, determine the unknown controller parameters so as to minimize a performance index for the system subject to certain constraint requirements. Numerous examples, varying from a single-input/single-output to a four-input/four-output system, are given to illustrate the design method, and the results obtained are compared with the results obtained by using other alternate design methods.

Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the \"internally balanced\" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">X_{c}, X_{\\bar{o}}</tex>\n, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1981.1102568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1981.1102568","startPage":"17","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24182/01102568.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principal component analysis in linear systems: Controllability, observability, and model reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1981","displayDocTitle":"Principal component analysis in linear systems: Controllability, observability, and model reduction","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal component analysis in linear systems: Controllability, observability, and model reduction","sourcePdf":"01102568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03777S","chronDate":"February  1981","isNumber":"24182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"3435","articleId":"1102568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":1102573,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Roughly speaking the p.r. represents an ideal control action which reduces the settling time to 0, while the b.p. simply means the bounded overshoot in this ideal situation. Simple frequency domain characterizations of the p.r. and the b.p. are derived. They reveal some invariance properties of the p.r. and the b.p. that provide a powerful tool for achieving the p.r. and the b.p. The existence condition for the p.r. is derived, which turns out to be identical to the result obtained in the optimal regulator theory. This result is extended to a more general control objective of attaining the p.r. for one output while keeping the b.p. for another output. A condition on which the p.r. is realized by an output feedback is also derived. A simple design algorithm is proposed for achieving the p.r. which is essentially the eigenvector assignment procedure. Finally, an application to a real system is discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24182/01102573.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1981.1102573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1981.1102573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1102573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to the perfect regulation and the bounded peaking in linear multivariable control systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","State feedback","Cost function","Frequency domain analysis","Output feedback","Algorithm design and analysis","Control engineering","Transfer functions","H infinity control","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Eigenstructure assignment, linear systems","Multivariable systems","Pole assignment, linear systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1981","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to the perfect regulation and the bounded peaking in linear multivariable control systems","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to the perfect regulation and the bounded peaking in linear multivariable control systems","sourcePdf":"01102573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083056S","chronDate":"Feb 1981","isNumber":"24182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"67","articleId":"1102573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1102596,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Stable feedback schemes obtainable from a given plant are parameterized. Salient properties of sensitivity reducing schemes are derived, and it is shown that plant uncertainty reduces the ability, of feedback to reduce sensitivity. The theory is developed for input-output systems in a general setting of Banach algebras, and then specialized to a class of multivariable, time-invariant systems characterized by\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n \\times n</tex>\nmatrices of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H^{\\infty}</tex>\nfrequency response functions, either with or without zeros in the right half-plane. The approach is based on the use of a weighted seminorm on the algebra of operators to measure sensitivity, and on the concept of an approximate inverse. Approximate invertibility, of the plant is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for sensitivity reduction. An indicator of approximate invertibility, called a measure of singularity, is introduced. The measure of singularity of a linear time-invariant plant is shown to be determined by the location of its right half-plane zeros. In the absence of plant uncertainty, the sensitivity, to output disturbances can be reduced to an optimal value approaching the singularity, measure. In particular, if there are no right half-plane zeros, sensitivity can be made arbitrarily small. The feedback schemes used in the optimization of sensitivity resemble the lead-lag networks of classical control design. Some of their properties, and methods of constructing them in special cases are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24183/01102603.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1981.1102603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1981.1102603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1102603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback and optimal sensitivity: Model reference transformations, multiplicative seminorms, and approximate inverses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Algebra","Frequency","Output feedback","Filters","MIMO","Sufficient conditions","Design optimization","Control design","Additives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Multivariable systems","Optimization methods","Output feedback","Sensitivity","Uncertain systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1981","displayDocTitle":"Feedback and optimal sensitivity: Model reference transformations, multiplicative seminorms, and approximate inverses","volume":"26","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback and optimal sensitivity: Model reference transformations, multiplicative seminorms, and approximate inverses","sourcePdf":"01102603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027513S","chronDate":"April  1981","isNumber":"24183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"1576","articleId":"1102603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1102604,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The main theorem describes a closed-form formulation for the optimal approximants, with the optimality verified by a complete error analysis. In deriving the main theorem, some useful singular value/vector properties associated with block-Hankel matrices are explored and a key extension theorem is also developed. Imbedded in the polynomial-theoretic derivation of the extension theorem is an efficient approximation algorithm.

Recognizing the limit of the traditional peak load pricing formulation and the persuasive breakthroughs in microelectronic technology, we introduce a philosophy in which supply and demand respond to each other through prices and consumptions, and the utility company sells power at \"real-time\" rates. We call it load adaptive pricing. By itself, the concept of load adaptive pricing is not new. The contribution of this paper is the formulation and resolution of this idea as a closed-loop dynamic Stackelberg game problem. The central part of this problem is how to choose appropriate incentives (i.e., pricing strategies) so that customers can be induced to behave co-operatively and thus achieve the team optimum. In this paper, the load adaptive pricing problem is solved for a particular producer/consumer model. We demonstrate that it is possible for the utility company to induce the customer to behave cooperatively to achieve the team optimum. We also show that in steady state, our solution converges and the system is stable.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1982.1102918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24189/01102918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1982.1102918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24189","startPage":"320","endPage":"329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load adaptive pricing: An emerging tool for electric utilities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1102918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Load adaptive pricing: An emerging tool for electric utilities","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1102918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1982","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load adaptive pricing: An emerging tool for electric utilities","sourcePdf":"01102918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041402S","chronDate":"Apr 1982","isNumber":"24189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1102918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1102937,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The switchings are modeled by a finite state ergodic Markov chain whose transition probability matrix is unknown and is assumed to belong to a compact set. A novel scheme, called truncated maximum likelihood estimation, is proposed for consistent estimation of the transition probabilities given noisy observations of the system output variables. Conditions for strong consistency are investigated assuming that the measurements are taken after the system has achieved a statistical steady state. The case when the true transition matrix does not belong to the unknown transition matrix set is also considered. The truncated maximum likelihood procedure is computationally feasible, whereas the standard maximum likelihood procedure is not, given large observation records. Finally, using the truncated ML algorithm, a suboptimal adaptive state estimator is proposed and its asymptotic behavior is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1982.1103061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24192/01103061.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1982.1103061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive estimation and identification for discrete systems with Markov jump parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103061/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive estimation and identification for discrete systems with Markov jump parameters","volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive estimation and identification for discrete systems with Markov jump parameters","sourcePdf":"01103061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07398S","chronDate":"Oct 1982","isNumber":"24192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"145","articleId":"1103061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1103101,"authors":[{"name":"V.

We consider the mean-square deviation between the optimal filter and the actual one during the steady state. This quantity is known to be essentially proportional to the step size of the algorithm. However, previous analyses were either heuristic, or based upon the assumption that successive observations were independent, which is far from being realistic. Actually, in most applications, two successive observation vectors share a large number of components and thus they are strongly correlated. In this work, we deal with the case of correlated observations and prove that the mean-square deviation is actually of the same order (or less) than the step size of the algorithm. This result is proved without any boundedness or barrier assumption for the algorithm, as it has been done previously in the literature to ensure the nondivergence. Our assumptions are reduced to the finite strong-memory assumption and the finite-moments assumption for the observation. They are satisfied in a very wide class of practical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24194/01103120.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"85","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1983.1103120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1983.1103120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second-order convergence analysis of stochastic adaptive linear filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Stochastic processes","Maximum likelihood detection","Adaptive filters","Vectors","Filtering algorithms","Nonlinear filters","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Steady-state","Independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Mean-square-error methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","displayDocTitle":"Second-order convergence analysis of stochastic adaptive linear filtering","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-order convergence analysis of stochastic adaptive linear filtering","sourcePdf":"01103120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044724S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"24194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"117","articleId":"1103120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1103136,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We follow the traditional formulation of this problem which gives rise to a large-scale, dynamic, mixed-integer programming problem. We describe a solution methodology based on duality, Lagrangian relaxation, and nondifferentiable optimization that has two unique features. First, computational requirements typically grow only linearly with the number of generating units. Second, the duality gap decreases in relative terms as the number of units increases, and as a result our algorithm tends to actually perform better for problems of large size. This allows for the first time consistently reliable solution of large practical problems involving several hundreds of units within realistic time constraints. Aside from the unit commitment problem, this methodology, is applicable to a broad class of large-scale dynamic scheduling and resource allocation problems involving integer variables.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24194/01103136.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1983.1103136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1983.1103136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal short-term scheduling of large-scale power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Power systems","Power system dynamics","Optimization methods","Cost function","Dynamic programming","Lagrangian functions","Time factors","Resource management","Appraisal"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dynamic programming","Integer programming","Large-scale systems","Power generation dispatch","Scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","displayDocTitle":"Optimal short-term scheduling of large-scale power systems","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal short-term scheduling of large-scale power systems","sourcePdf":"01103136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057332S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"24194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"153","articleId":"1103136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1103137,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This research investigates a tracker able to handle \"multiple hot-spot\" targets, in which digital (or optical) signal processing is employed on the FLIR data to identify the underlying target shape. This identified shape is then used in the measurement model portion of the filter as it estimates target offset from the center of the field-of-view. In this algorithm, an extended Kalman filter processes the raw intensity measurements from the FLIR to produce target estimates. An alternative algorithm uses a linear Kalman filter to process the position indications of an enhanced correlator in order to generate tracking estimates; the enhancement is accomplished not only by thresholding to eliminate poor correlation information, but also by incorporating the dynamics information from the Kalman filter and the on-line identification of the target shape as a template instead of merely using previous frames of data. The performance capabilities of these two algorithms are evaluated under various tracking environment conditions and for a range of choices of design parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive tracking of multiple hot-spot target IR images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1983.1103150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24195/01103150.pdf","startPage":"937","endPage":"943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1983.1103150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24195","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1983","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive tracking of multiple hot-spot target IR images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"October 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive tracking of multiple hot-spot target IR images","sourcePdf":"01103150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034393S","chronDate":"Oct 1983","isNumber":"24195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1103150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1103151,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An alternative approach is to divide the problem into two parts: optimum path planning for off-line processing followed by on-line path tracking. The path tracking can be achieved by adopting the existing approach. The path planning is done at the joint level. Cubic spline functions are used for constructing joint trajectories for industrial robots. The motion of the robot is specified by a sequence of Cartesian knots, i.e., positions and orientations of the hand. For an\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</tex>\n-joint robot, these Cartesian knots are transformed into\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</tex>\nsets of joint displacements, with one set for each joint.

An algorithm is developed to schedule the time intervals between each pair of adjacent knots such that the total traveling time is minimized subject to the physical constraints on joint velocities, accelerations, and jerks.

In contrast, formulating the TMA estimation problem in modified polar (MP) coordinates leads to an extended Kalman filter which is both stable and asymptotically unbiased. Exact state equations for the MP filter are derived without imposing any restrictions on own-ship motion; thus, prediction accuracy inherent in the traditional Cartesian formulation is completely preserved. In addition, these equations reveal that MP coordinates are well-suited for bearings-only TMA because they automatically decouple observable and unobservable components of the estimated state vector. Such decoupling is shown to prevent covariance matrix ill-conditioning, which is the primary cause of filter instability. Further investigation also confirms that the MP state estimates are asymptotically unbiased. Realistic simulation data are presented to support these findings and to compare algorithm performance with respect to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (ideal) as well as the Cartesian and pseudolinear filters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24199/01103230.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1983.1103230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1983.1103230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilization of modified polar coordinates for bearings-only tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Nonlinear equations","Target tracking","Sea measurements","Motion analysis","State estimation","Differential equations","Accuracy","Covariance matrix","Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Decoupling of systems","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Kalman filtering, nonlinear systems","Matrices","Sonar tracking","Tracking filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1983","displayDocTitle":"Utilization of modified polar coordinates for bearings-only tracking","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilization of modified polar coordinates for bearings-only tracking","sourcePdf":"01103230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041004S","chronDate":"Mar 1983","isNumber":"24199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"326","articleId":"1103230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1103231,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Extensions such as prefiltering of data and use of additional instruments are included in the analysis. The parameter estimates are shown to be asymptotically Gaussian distributed. An explicit expression is given for the covariance matrix of their distribution. The covariance matrix is then taken as a (multivariable) measure of accuracy. It is shown how it can be optimized by an appropriate selection of instruments and prefilter. The so obtained optimal instrumental variable estimates cannot be used directly since the true system and the statistical properties of the disturbance must be known in order to compute the optimal instruments and prefilters. A multistep procedure consisting of three or four simple steps is then proposed as a way to overcome this difficulty. This procedure includes modeling of the disturbance as an ARMA process using a statistically efficient method such as a prediction error method. The statistical properties of the estimates obtained with the multistep procedure are also analyzed. Those estimates are shown to be asymptotically Gaussian distributed as well. The covariance matrix of the estimation errors is compared to that corresponding to a prediction error method. For some model structures these two approaches give the same asymptotic accuracy. The conclusion is that the multistep procedure, which is quite easy to implement and also has nice uniqueness properties, can be viewed as an interesting alternative to prediction error methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1983.1103312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24203/01103312.pdf","endPage":"772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal instrumental variable estimation and approximate implementations","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1983.1103312","startPage":"757","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1983","displayDocTitle":"Optimal instrumental variable estimation and approximate implementations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103312/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1983","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal instrumental variable estimation and approximate implementations","sourcePdf":"01103312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043202S","chronDate":"Jul 1983","isNumber":"24203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"75","articleId":"1103312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1103324,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Two complementary contributions are added to the famous 1977 Ljung theorem. First we drop the condition of nondivergence of the algorithm assumed by Ljung. While that condition can be ensured by adding a barrier, the convergence of the suitably bounded algorithm itself is not established even on the basis of Ljung theorem. Here, the barrier problem is overcome by proving that it is not necessary for the convergence. Our second contribution is to generalize the model describing the correlated observations. No state space model is used and no linear relationship between the observations and the signal to be estimated needs to be assumed. Instead we use a decreasing covariance model that agrees with a very wide class of practical applications.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24210/01103463.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1984.1103463","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1984.1103463","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103463","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Stochastic processes","State-space methods","State estimation","Vectors","Polynomials","Statistics","Maximum likelihood detection","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Adaptive estimation, linear systems","Gradient methods","Stochastic approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1984","displayDocTitle":"Convergence of an adaptive linear estimation algorithm","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1984","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence of an adaptive linear estimation algorithm","sourcePdf":"01103463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033429S","chronDate":"Feb 1984","isNumber":"24210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"47","articleId":"1103463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1103466,"authors":[{"name":"Chaw-Bing Chang","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Chaw-Bing Chang","id":"37832365000"},{"name":"J.

A probabilistic model of the EMG patterns is first formulated in the feature space of integral absolute value (IAV) to describe the relation between a command, represented by motion and speed variables, and location and shape of the corresponding pattern. The model provides the sample probability density function of pattern classes in the decision space of variance and zero crossings based on the relations between IAV, variance, and zero crossings established in this paper. Pattern classification is carried out through a multiclass sequential decision procedure designed with an emphasis on computational simplicity. The upper bound of probability of error and the average number of sample observations are investigated. Speed and motion predictions are used in conjunction with the decision procedure to enhance decision speed and reliability.

The graph metric induces a \"graph topology\" on unstable plants, which is the weakest possible topology in which feedback stability is robust. Using the graph metric, it is possible to derive estimates for the robustness of feedback stability without assuming that the perturbed and unperturbed plants have the same number of RHP poles. If the perturbed and unperturbed systems have the same RHP poles, then it is possible to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for robustness with respect to a given class of perturbations. As an application of these results, the design of stabilizing controllers for unstable singularly perturbed systems is studied. Finally, the relationship of the graph metric to the \"gap metric\" introduced by Zames and El-Sakkary is studied in detail. In particular, it is shown that the robustness results of Zames and El-Sakkary do not enable one to conclude the causality, of the perturbed system, whereas the present results do.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The graph metric for unstable plants and robustness estimates for feedback stability","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1984.1103547","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24213/01103547.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1984.1103547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103547/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1984","displayDocTitle":"The graph metric for unstable plants and robustness estimates for feedback stability","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"May 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The graph metric for unstable plants and robustness estimates for feedback stability","sourcePdf":"01103547.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035643S","chronDate":"May 1984","isNumber":"24213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"177","articleId":"1103547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1103563,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A comparison to the decoupled case shows the structure of the coupling.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24215/01103601.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1984.1103601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1984.1103601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The decentralized quickest detection problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Cost function","Dynamic programming","Equations","Delay","Contracts","Statistics","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Distributed detection","Level-crossing problems","Markov processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1984","displayDocTitle":"The decentralized quickest detection problem","volume":"29","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The decentralized quickest detection problem","sourcePdf":"01103601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034169S","chronDate":"Jul 1984","isNumber":"24215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1103601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1103633,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Usually the obstacles are expanded to compensate for the body width of the robot. For robots with a prismatic joint, which allows only a translational motion along its axis, additional problems created by the long boom are handled by means of pseudoobstacles which are generated by real obstacle's edges and faces. The environment is then modified by the inclusion of pseudoobstacles which contribute to the forbidden regions. This process allows the robot itself again to be represented by a point specifying the location of its end effector in space. An algorithm for determining the shortest distance collision-free path given a sequence of edges to be traversed has been developed for the case of stationary obstacles.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Service robots","Orbital robotics","Manipulators","End effectors","Computer industry","Application software","Fixtures","Engine cylinders","Robotics and automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Manipulator motion-planning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.1984.1103640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24216/01103640.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1984.1103640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum distance collision-free path planning for industrial robots with a prismatic joint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimum distance collision-free path planning for industrial robots with a prismatic joint","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103640/","volume":"29","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum distance collision-free path planning for industrial robots with a prismatic joint","sourcePdf":"01103640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033793S","chronDate":"Aug 1984","isNumber":"24216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1103640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1103644,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The process is inherently nonlinear and exhibits unusual observability properties that are geometry-dependent. A maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the target motion analysis solution is developed and its performance analyzed. A comparison is drawn between the MLE and two previously reported methods, a nonlinear modified-instrumental variable estimate (MIV) and the pseudo-linear estimate (PLE). Both the MIV and PLE are shown to derive from approximations to the nonlinear measurement equation and therefore share some common properties with the MLE. The limits on performance that can be expected from processing bearing data are detailed. Specifically, for long range-to-baseline geometries, approximate expressions for the Cramer-Rao bound are derived. Extension of the results to the practical filters approximately predicts numerically observed behavior. For less restrictive geometries, bounds are presented. Incorporation of a target speed constraint on the MLE results in a transition to a lower dimensional problem as noise level and range increases. Monte Carlo experimental results are presented and the improvements realized by the MLE techniques are evident.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental properties and performance of conventional bearings-only target motion analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1984.1103664","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24217/01103664.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1984.1103664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1984","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental properties and performance of conventional bearings-only target motion analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental properties and performance of conventional bearings-only target motion analysis","sourcePdf":"01103664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095161S","chronDate":"Sep 1984","isNumber":"24217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"340","articleId":"1103664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1103674,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The response of a linear network to a modulated suppressed-carrier excitation is formulated in terms of in-phase and quadrature carrier components. The relationship between the modulation on these components and the exciting modulation is shown to depend upon operators simply related to the original network function. The expansion of the data-frequency operators into partial fractions is shown to lead to a simple synthesis procedure for deriving the original network operator from the in-phase or quadrature operators. As an example, the process is applied to the derivation of a representative network for lead compensation of an AC servo responsive to the in-phase component of error signal. The use of RC networks in AC servo compensation is shown to be limited to derivative types of equalization.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1957.1103779","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/24222/01103779.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1957.1103779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of A-C networks for servo compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1957","displayDocTitle":"On the design of A-C networks for servo compensation","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1957","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of A-C networks for servo compensation","sourcePdf":"01103779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022809S","chronDate":"February  1957","isNumber":"24222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","articleId":"1103779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1103787,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Conditions for global stability (convergence of the tracking error with bounded signals) are derived for a discrete-time pole-zero placement adaptive controller where the parameter estimator is modified in terms of normalized signals. Following an input-output perpective, the overall system is decomposed into two subsystems reflecting the parameter estimation and modeling errors, respectively, and its stability is studied using the sector stability and passivity theorems. First the analysis is carried for the class of disturbances and reference inputs that are either decaying or can be exactly hulled by a linear controller of the chosen structure.

Our analysis focuses on a simplified recursive model for describing locally the dynamics of the traffic intensity. The convergence analysis of this local model is reduced to stability analysis of a deterministic differential equation, and reveals a speed of convergence versus steady-state accuracy tradeoff. We introduce measures for evaluating this tradeoff. We use the proposed measures to show how certain parameter choices might best be made, and to study the effect of feedback limitations and channel errors on the performance of the random-access system. Our results show that with proper parameter choices the considered policies can be made extremely insensitive to channel errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24227/01103904.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1985.1103904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1985.1103904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On retransmission control policies in multiple-access communication networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system control","Communication networks","Feedback","Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Convergence","Frequency division multiplexing","Stability analysis","Differential equations","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Communication system control","Multiaccess communication","Packet switching","Stochastic processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1985","displayDocTitle":"On retransmission control policies in multiple-access communication networks","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On retransmission control policies in multiple-access communication networks","sourcePdf":"01103904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042282S","chronDate":"February  1985","isNumber":"24227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1103904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1103935,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The measurement noise and process noise covariances determine, via the Riccati equation, the state estimation error covariance. When the origin of the measurements is also uncertain, one has the widely studied problem of data association (or data correlation), and tracking performance depends critically on signal processing parameters, primarily the probabilities of detection and false alarm. In this paper we derive a modified Riccati equation that quantifies (approximately) the dependence of the state error covariance on these parameters. We also show how to use a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in conjunction with the above relationship to determine the detection threshold in the signal processing system that provides measurements to the tracker so as to minimize tracking errors. The approach presented in this paper provides a feedback mechanism from the information processing (tracking) subsystem to the signal processing subsystem so as to optimize the overall performance in clutter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24228/01103935.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1985.1103935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1985.1103935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection thresholds for tracking in clutter--A connection between estimation and signal processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Noise measurement","Target tracking","Riccati equations","Motion measurement","Filters","Covariance matrix","Additive noise","Measurement uncertainty","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Algebraic Riccati equation (ARE)","Clutter","Covariance analysis","Riccati equations, algebraic","State estimation, linear systems","Target detection","Tracking filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1985","displayDocTitle":"Detection thresholds for tracking in clutter--A connection between estimation and signal processing","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection thresholds for tracking in clutter--A connection between estimation and signal processing","sourcePdf":"01103935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04202S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"24228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"115","articleId":"1103935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1103942,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We have defined new performance measures for real-time controller computers based on this coupling. We present a systematic study of a typical critical controlled process in the context of new performance measures that express the performance of both controlled processes and controller computers (taken as a unit) on the basis of a single variable: controller response time. Controller response time is a function of current system state, system failure rate, electrical and/or magnetic interference, etc., and is therefore a random variable. Control overhead is expressed as monotonically nondecreasing function of the response time and the system suffers catastrophic failure, or dynamic failure, if the response time for a control task exceeds the corresponding system hard deadline, if any. The controlled-process chosen for study is an aircraft in the final stages of descent, just prior to landing. Control constraints are particularly severe during this period, and great care must be taken in the design of controllers that handle this process. First, the performance measures for the controller are presented. Second, control algorithms for solving the landing problem are discussed, and finally the impact of our performance measures on the problem is analyzed, showing that the performance measures and the associated estimation method have potential use for designing and/or evaluating real-time controllers and controlled process. In common with all other control techniques, the computational complexity involved in obtaining these measures is susceptible to the curse of dimensionality.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1985.1103952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24229/01103952.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1985.1103952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified method for evaluating real-time computer controllers and its application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1103952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1103952/","displayDocTitle":"A unified method for evaluating real-time computer controllers and its application","volume":"30","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified method for evaluating real-time computer controllers and its application","sourcePdf":"01103952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03383S","chronDate":"Apr 1985","isNumber":"24229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"79","articleId":"1103952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1103972,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This division has been adopted mainly as a means of alleviating difficulties in dealing with complex, coupled manipulator dynamics. Trajectory planning usually determines the timing of manipulator position and velocity without considering its dynamics. Consequently, the simplicity obtained from the division comes at the expense of efficiency in utilizing robot's capabilities. To remove at least partially this inefficiency, this paper considers a solution to the problem of moving a manipulator in minimum time along a specified geometric path subject to input torque/force constraints. We first describe the manipulator dynamics using parametric functions which represent geometric path constraints to be honored for collision avoidance as well as task requirements. Second, constraints on input torques/ forces are converted to those on the parameters. Third, the minimum-time solution is deduced in an algorithm form using phase-plane techniques. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate utility of the trajectory planning method developed.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1985.1104009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24231/01104009.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1985.1104009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum-time control of robotic manipulators with geometric path constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1985","displayDocTitle":"Minimum-time control of robotic manipulators with geometric path constraints","volume":"30","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104009/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum-time control of robotic manipulators with geometric path constraints","sourcePdf":"01104009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030603S","chronDate":"Jun 1985","isNumber":"24231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"711","articleId":"1104009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1104012,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is demonstrated thai there exist two infinite-gain operators in the nonlinear dynamic system which determines the time-evolution of output and parameter errors. The pragmatic implication of the existence of such infinite-gain operators is that 1) sinusoidal reference inputs at specific frequencies and/or 2) sinusoidal output disturbances at any frequency (including dc), can cause the loop gain to increase without bound, thereby exciting the unmodeled high-frequency dynamics, and yielding an unstable control system. Hence, it is concluded that existing adaptive control algorithms as they are presented in the literature referenced in this paper, cannot be used with confidence in practical designs where the plant contains unmodeled dynamics because instability is likely to result. Further understanding is required to ascertain how the currently implemented adaptive systems differ from the theoretical systems studied here and how further theoretical development can improve the robustness of adaptive controllers.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1985.1104070","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24234/01104070.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1985.1104070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"881","endPage":"889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness of continuous-time adaptive control algorithms in the presence of unmodeled dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1104070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1985","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of continuous-time adaptive control algorithms in the presence of unmodeled dynamics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104070/","volume":"30","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness of continuous-time adaptive control algorithms in the presence of unmodeled dynamics","sourcePdf":"01104070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128894S","chronDate":"Sep 1985","isNumber":"24234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"478","articleId":"1104070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1104076,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-Ren Cao","affiliation":["Division of Applied Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Xi-Ren Cao","id":"37276620700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"1104076","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Parameter estimation","Stochastic processes","Computer simulation","Approximation algorithms","Probability","System performance","Stochastic systems","Random variables","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gradient methods","Monte Carlo methods","Parameter estimation","Sensitivity","Stochastic approximation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence of parameter sensitivity estimates in a stochastic experiment","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1985.1104076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24234","endPage":"853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24234/01104076.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1985.1104076","startPage":"845","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1104076","abstract":"To reduce the error in estimating the gradient (parameter sensitivity) of an unknown function is of great importance in stochastic optimization problems.

The problem formulation is based on a ring theoretic setting for linear systems, and is distinguished by the use of a novel control system configuration. Any interconnection of two distinct systems can be represented in terms of this configuration while preserving the distinction between the two systems. Furthermore, no other configuration has this property. Several benefits and extensions are accrued as a result of using this configuration. First, a completely general, yet physically meaningful problem formulation results. Consequently, state-space and operator theoretic approaches to linear control system stability are thoroughly reconciled. This reconciliation embraces continuous-time as well as discrete-time systems, lumped as well as distributed systems, and 1-D as well as\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</tex>\n-D systems. Second, the controller parametrization affords four degrees-of-freedom, two more than any existing parametrization. The additional degrees-of-freedom make explicit the design opportunity associated with controller implementation, and thus determine several important control system characteristics. This result is expected to provide a theoretical basis for the development of comprehensive control system design methodologies, wherein design considerations related to controller implementation are addressed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1986","volume":"31","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic aspects of linear control system stability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic aspects of linear control system stability","sourcePdf":"01104137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040961S","chronDate":"October  1986","isNumber":"24236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1104137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1104143,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Chu Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Kuo-Chu Chang","id":"37087218378"},{"name":"Chee-Yee Chong","affiliation":["Advanced Decision Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chee-Yee Chong","id":"37086984981"},{"name":"Y.

The joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm, which has been successfully used for tracking multiple targets in a cluttered environment, assumes a centralized processing architecture. It assumes that measurements are transmitted to a central site and processed. In some applications, however, it may be desirable for the sensor measurements to be processed at or near the sensors instead of transmitting them to the central processor. The local processed results are then sent over a communication network to be used by other processors.

The objective is to choose a controller that minimizes the maximum amplitude of the plant output in response to such a disturbance. Mathematically, this corresponds to requiring uniformly good disturbance rejection over all time. Since the problem of optimal tracking is equivalent to that of optimal disturbance rejection if a feedback controller is used (see [7, sect. 5.6]), the theory presented here can also be used to design optimal controllers that achieve uniformly good tracking over all time rather than a tracking error whose L\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n-norm is small, as is the case with the currently popular\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H_{\\infty}</tex>\ntheory.

It is shown that the problem studied here has quite different features from its predecessor.

It is shown that, if updating is done in sufficiently small steps, the group will converge to the policy that maximizes the long-term expected reward per step. The analysis is based on learning in sequential stochastic games and on certain properties, derived in this paper, of ergodic Markov chains.

Two methods are suggested for the solution of the continuous-time problem; an exact method which leads to a finite-dimensional nonlinear programming problem, and an approximate method which leads to a linear programming problem.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1987.1104455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24248/01104455.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1987.1104455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"<tex>L^{1}</tex>-optimal compensators for continuous-time systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1104455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104455/","displayDocTitle":"<tex>L^{1}</tex>-optimal compensators for continuous-time systems","volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<tex>L^{1}</tex>-optimal compensators for continuous-time systems","sourcePdf":"01104455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028376S","chronDate":"October  1987","isNumber":"24248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"168","articleId":"1104455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1104468,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The LQ regulator of interest here is, unlike the usual one, designed without specifying a quadratic cost, but it proves to minimize some quadratic cost; hence, it possesses those well-known robustness properties shared by all LQ regulators. A basic design procedure is developed first, and followed by practical ones in which the design parameters are chosen based on asymptotic modal properties of the regulator. This new method requires no Riccati solutions, thereby leading to simplification of the LQ design as compared to the usual one.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24249/01104479.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"1004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1987.1104479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1987.1104479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1104479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to the LQ design from the viewpoint of the inverse regulator problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Design methodology","Feedback control","Optimal control","Costs","Riccati equations","Sufficient conditions","Robustness","Robust stability","State feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Inverse problems, linear","Linear-quadratic control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1987","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to the LQ design from the viewpoint of the inverse regulator problem","volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to the LQ design from the viewpoint of the inverse regulator problem","sourcePdf":"01104479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02753S","chronDate":"Nov 1987","isNumber":"24249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"86","articleId":"1104479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1104481,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this adaptive law the output error plays a dual role in the adjustment of the control parameter vector. The advantages of using the adaptive law over others proposed in the literature are discussed. In the ideal case the adaptive system has bounded solutions; in addition, the origin of the error equations is exponentially stable when the reference input is persistently exciting and has a sufficiently large amplitude. The adaptive system is also shown to be robust under bounded external disturbances. Finally, it is shown that, by suitably modifying the adaptive law, the overall system can be made robust in the presence of a class of unmodeled dynamics of the plant. Simulation results are presented throughout the paper to complement the theoretical developments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new adaptive law for robust adaptation without persistent excitation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1987.1104543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24251/01104543.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1987.1104543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1104543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive law for robust adaptation without persistent excitation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive law for robust adaptation without persistent excitation","sourcePdf":"01104543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027306S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"24251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"581","articleId":"1104543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1104549,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This led the leadership of the IEEE Control Systems Society to recommend that a workshop be organized to assess the state of the art of the field and outline directions of research. An Organizing Committee, consisting of D. D. Siljak (Chairman), G. F. Franklin, A. H. Levis, and W. R. Perkins, submitted a proposal to the Systems Theory and Operations Research Program of the National Science Foundation to hold such a workshop at the University of Santa Clara, in Santa Clara, CA, on September 18-19, 1986. As part of the proposal effort, a Steering Committee was constituted to assist the organizers in selecting workshop participants and to carry out the preparalory work for the meeting. The twelve-member Steering Committee consisted of the four organizers and eight other individuals: R. W. Brockett, E. J. Davison, Y.-C. Ho, P. Kokotovic, A. J. Laub, S. 1. Marcus, W. F. Powers, and S. S. Sastry. In early 1986, the organizers issued an open call for participation in the workshop that was published in the April issue of the IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAGAZINE. in addition, more than 150 letters were sent to leaders in the field, inviting them to apply for participation in the workshop. The Steering Committee was also asked to identify individuals who could provide unique perspectives. The cut-off date for applications, that included a statement of proposed contribution, was May 31. In June, during the 1986 American Control Conference, the Steering Committee met for many hours to select the participants from the many applicants and to decide on the final structure of the program. One of the decisions was to invite all the Presidential Young Investigator awardees who had applied, another was to limit the total number of participants to fifty. In addition to the Steering Committee, the following persons attended and contributed to the deliberations: K. J. Astrom, M. Athans, D. Auslander, J. S. Baras, T. Basar, G. Blankenship, S. P. Boyd, A. E. Bryson, Jr., J. Burns, J. Cassidy, J. B. Cruz, D. F. Delchamps, C. A. Desoer, R. F. Drenick, T. Edgar, J. S. Freudenberg, D. Gangsaas, J. Grizzle, A. H. Haddad, W. E. Hopkins, Jr., M. Il\u00ed-Spong, P. loannou, T. L. Johnson, T. Kailath, A. J. Krener, R. E. Larson, W. S. Levine, J. L. Melsa, J. M. Mendel, G. Meyer, J. B. Pearson, H. E. Rauch, G. N. Saridis, J. L. Speyer, J. N. Tsitsiklis, P. Varaiya, G. C. Verghese, M. Vidyasagar, A. S. Willsky, and M. Wonham. The National Science Foundation was represented by Dr. M. P. Polis, Program Director of the Systems Theory and Operations Research Program, and by Dr. G. Hazelrig, Acting Program Director of the Instrumentation, Sensing, and Measurement Systems Program. The workshop was organized into plenary sessions and breakout sessions, during which Working Groups discussed and wrote the material that forms the basis of this report. Seven keynote talks addressed the main themes of the workshop: accomplishments in the past twenty five years and definition of important current and future research problems drawn from the needs of the industrial and service sectors of the economy. The Working Groups were structured so that, while discussions could take place with few constraints, written materials could be produced by the end of each session. To that effect, each group had one or two persons designated as recorders, with the primary responsibility of keeping notes during the discussion and assisting the group leaders in preparing the Working Group draft reports. In order to provide some focus in the deliberations of the Working Groups,eight persons were asked to prepare position statements based on their own perspectives. Seven of these position papers are being published concurrently in the April 1987 issue of the IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAGAZINE. The eighth one is appearing in this issue of the TRANSACTIONS as a perspectives paper. The findings of the workshop were documented in a final report; the paper that follows is the main body of that report. It was prepared by a group of Editors (A. H. Levis, S. I. Marcus, W. R. Perkins, P. Kokotovic, M. Athans, R. W. Brockett. and A. S. Willsky) on the basis of the contributions, both oral and written, of all the participants, the advocacy papers, and the keynote talks. The draft was reviewed and edited further first by the members of the Steering Committee and then by all the participants. It is indeed a collective effort-A. H.

SRM's are quite simple, low cost, and reliable motors as compared to the widely used dc motors. However, the SRM presents a coupled nonlinear multivariable control structure which calls for complex nonlinear control design in order to achieve high dynamic performances. We first develop a detailed nonlinear model which matches experimental data and establish an electronic commutation strategy. Then, on the basis of recent nonlinear control techniques, we design a state feedback control algorithm which compensates for all the nonlinearities and decouples the effect of stator phase currents in the torque production. The position dependent logic of the electronic commutator assigns control authority to one phase, which controls the motion, while the remaining phase currents are forced to decay to zero. Simulations for a direct drive, single link manipulator with the SRM are reported, which show the control performance of the algorithm we propose in nominal conditions and test its robustness versus the most critical parameter uncertainties of payload mass and stator resistance.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1987.1104616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24254/01104616.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1987.1104616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24254","startPage":"371","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback linearizing control of switched reluctance motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1104616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feedback linearizing control of switched reluctance motors","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback linearizing control of switched reluctance motors","sourcePdf":"01104616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053801S","chronDate":"May 1987","isNumber":"24254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"380","articleId":"1104616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1104619,"authors":[{"name":"K.

An explicit algorithm for designing such controllers is then given. A simple controller, called the high gain servomechanism controller is also presented, which has the property that it gives AGAER and arbitrarily good transient response, when the robust exact asymptotic tracking/regulation requirement is relaxed. This controller shows that dynamics in a controller is not essential for achieving good error regulation in the presence of unknown unmeasurable disturbances. It is also shown that using the controllers proposed, exact error regulation occurs, for a larger class of design signals, called the extended disturbance/reference input signals, even if the conditions for perfect control are not satisfied.

The nominal plant is supposed to be controlled by means of a feedback control law which is optimal with respect to some given criterion. The robustness of the closed-loop system is studied for two different classes of perturbations in the control law, which are called gain and additive nonlinear perturbations. The results are entirely based on the existence of a stationary solution of the dynamic programming equation (DPE), which provides directly a Lyapunov function associated to the closed-loop system. The convexity of that solution and the use of the Taylor formula appear to be the key to establish the robustness properties of the nominal plant. Two examples are solved in order to show an interesting fact: the existence of a compromise between the robustness of the system subjected to the two different classes of perturbations.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1987.1104696","startPage":"703","endPage":"710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1987.1104696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24257","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24257/01104696.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the robustness of optimal regulators for nonlinear discrete-time systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104696/","displayDocTitle":"On the robustness of optimal regulators for nonlinear discrete-time systems","volume":"32","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the robustness of optimal regulators for nonlinear discrete-time systems","sourcePdf":"01104696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043724S","chronDate":"Aug 1987","isNumber":"24257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"33","articleId":"1104696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1104711,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The idea of GSHF is to periodically sample the output of the system, and generate the control by means of a hold function applied to the resulting sequence. The hold function is chosen based on the dynamics of the system to be controlled. This method appears to have several advantages over dynamic controllers: it has the efficacy of state feedback without the requirement of state estimation; it provides the control system designer with substantially more freedom; and it requires few on-line computations. This paper focuses on four questions: pole assignment, specific behavior, noise sensitivity, and robustness. Among the problems solved are: simultaneous arbitrary pole assignment for a finite number of systems by a single GSHF controller, exact model matching, decoupling, and optimal noise rejection. Examples are given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104711/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1987","volume":"32","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Control of linear systems using generalized sampled-data hold functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of linear systems using generalized sampled-data hold functions","sourcePdf":"01104711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044472S","chronDate":"September  1987","isNumber":"24258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"337","articleId":"1104711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":1104748,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The method presented is applicable to systems commanded by discretely valued inputs, and processes whose outputs may be similarly quantized. Periodic sampling is not required. The most suitable sampling is by transmission of only significant data, as the new value obtained when the data are changed by a given increment. In certain cases, transmission of data by this means can be used to increase channel capacity. When the data are so quantized, the error signal is constrained to a finite number of discrete values, each of which may be associated with an area in the phase plane. Within each such area, the trajectories of any process subject to phase plane representation are a family of parallel curves. Thus, analytic synthesis may be simplified in the case of certain nonlinear processes. Graphical design is facilitated without requiring deduction of a mathematical representation of the process. The method is illustrated by synthesis of several systems involving a simple linear process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104845/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1959","publicationDate":"November 1959","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"4","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extension of phase plane analysis to quantized systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extension of phase plane analysis to quantized systems","sourcePdf":"01104845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043893S","chronDate":"Nov 1959","isNumber":"24269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1104845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1104847,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The military and commercial implications of such devices are impressive, and interest in the two main areas of research in the field of control, the USA and the USSR, runs high. Unfortunately, though, both theory and construction of adaptive controllers are in their infancy, and some time may pass before they are commonplace. Nonetheless, development at this time of adequate theories of processes of this nature is essential. The purpose of our paper is to show how the functional equation technique of a new mathematical discipline, dynamic programming, can be used in the formulation and solution of a variety of optimization problems concerning the design of adaptive devices. Although, occasionally, a solution in closed form can be obtained, in general, numerical solution via the use of high-speed digital computers is contemplated. We discuss here the closely allied problems of formulating adaptive control processes in precise mathematical terms and of presenting feasible computational algoritbms for determining numerical solutioms. To illustrate the general concepts, consider a system which is governed by the inhomogeneous Van der Pol equation\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\ddot{x} + \\mu(x^{2} - 1) \\dot{x} + x = r(t), 0 \\leq t \\leq T</tex>\n, where\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r(t)</tex>\nis a random function whose statistical properties are only partially known to a feedback control device which seeks to keep the system near the unstable equilibrium state\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x = 0, \\dot{x} = 0</tex>\n. It proposes to do this by selecting the value of \u03bc as a function of the state of the system at time\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</tex>\n, and the time\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</tex>\nitself. By observing the random process\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r(t)</tex>\n, the controller may, with the passage of time, infer more and more concerning the statistical properties of the function\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r(t)</tex>\nand thus may be expected to improve the quality of its control decisions. In this way the controller adapts itself to circumstances as it finds them. The process is thus an interesting example of adaptive control, and, conceivably, with some immediate applications. Lastly, some areas of this general domain requiring additional research are indicated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1104847/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1959","publicationDate":"November 1959","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"4","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On adaptive control processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On adaptive control processes","sourcePdf":"01104847.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026414S","chronDate":"November  1959","isNumber":"24269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"128","articleId":"1104847","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1104855,"authors":[{"name":"M.

First, the spring constant of a structural member is replaced by a complex number to allow for hysteresis losses during vibration. The corresponding characteristic function has non-conjugate zeroes which are useful in calculating frequency response, but have no meaning for transient response. Secondly, vibration acting along the input axis of a pendulous accelerometer causing displacement of the proof mass; an in-Phase cross vibration will cause a rectified torque. The real part of the compliance function is needed; knowing the zeroes is useful but not necessary in evaluating the integral over the frequency range by use of residues. Third, sampled-data systems have z transforms which often involve the sum of reciprocals of vectors. Finding real values of zeroes is simplified because only magnitudes need be considered; some graphical techniques can simplify the general vector problem.

An explicit design procedure (well adapted to digital computation) is presented. In addition, some fundamental new concepts (controllability, observability, etc.) are introduced. A general theory of control systems is outlined which answers many basic questions (what is controllable? why? how?) and gives a highly efficient method of computation.

It is desired to design a contactor control which yields a near-optimum follow-up of a given input. For zero-seeking systems and for step-inputs an \"optimum\" control problem can be defined easily; however, a general solution of the optimum problem is not yet available. The known particular cases yield switching surfaces in the phase space which depend on the particular pole and zero locations (parameter set). The realization of such surfaces is rather difficult and usually demands digital computer equipment. The author and her associates suggest in this paper switching functions which can be realized easily and which give good response for different parameter sets. Particular attention is given to the occurrence of discontinuities in linear switching functions and their advantages and disadvantages; to different types of chatter, which may or may not improve the system performance; to discontinuities in the switching function which can be avoided by feeding the output of the contactor back into the switching function. Analog computer tests show the performance of systems with linear switching functions. The choice of the coefficients in this linear switching function is discussed. The influence of imperfections of the control system on its performance is investigated. Comparison to linear feedback control systems are included.

With this approach the study of conditional feedback, model feedback, combined positive and negative feedback, etc. is of secondary interest. The benefits of feedback are paid for in gain-bandwidth of active elements over and above what is needed to physically do the job. The minimum price that must be paid is independent of configuration. The system with two degrees of freedom is studied in detail. Two methods are presented for the precise design of a system that will be as insensitive as may be desired to large parameter variations. One method uses root-locus techniques and is suitable for systems with a small number of dominant poles and zeros. The second method is based on frequency response and can be used for systems of any complexity.

Based on extensive analytical and experimental studies, robot dynamic models are presented that have been validated over the frequency range 0 to 50 Hz. These models exhibit a strong influence of drive system flexibility, producing lightly damped poles in the neighborhood of 8 Hz, 14 Hz, and 40 Hz, all unmodeled by the conventional rigid-body multiple-link robot dynamic approach. The models presented also quantify the significance of non-linearities in the drive system, in addition to those well known in the linkage itself.

A control problem may exist for one or two principal reasons. 1) The plant parameters may vary or they may be only vaguely known, and the system response sensitivity to the parameter variation is to be reduced. 2) The system response to disturbances is to be reduced. A synthesis procedure for attaining these objectives and simultaneously realizing a desired set of system transmission functions is developed in this paper. The role of system configuration is considered. Design is broken up into two separate regions. In the significant system-response frequency region, there is straightforward synthesis in attaining the design objectives. In the higher frequency range, the loop transmission must be shaped so that the system is stable. The latter problem is considerably more difficult when there are substantial plant parameter variations.

It is an inevitable consequence of the internal and external missile environment that all body bending modes are excited. The general method of stabilizing a missile is to choose a minimum of inertial sensors such as rate and attitude gyros, and through the use of passive electrical networks in the information paths, generate stabilizing poles and zeros in the control system open-loop transfer functions. Generally, the electrical shaping networks are approximations to \"maximally\" flat functions with the cutoff frequency below the first bending mode resonant frequency, and in extreme cases, a notch filter is needed to eliminate body bending information. Tae basic purpose of the electrical shaping networks is to attenuate the high signal frequencies circulating in the control loop without the loss of important low frequency data. In some applications the use of passive shaping networks becomes very difficult because of the large attenuation required near the first body bending resonant frequency and the required amplitude flatness at lower frequencies. If passive shaping cannot be used, then active networks must be substituted. This is an undesirable complexity. This paper presents an optimum design procedure to utilize the characteristic properties of completed airframe and missile structures to acquire a maximum increase in modal damping without auxiliary equipment and further autopilot complexity by the proper choice of the subassembly attaching fixtures. Completed airframes and missiles are composed of a very lightweight integral structure in which a large number of equipment sub-assemblies are attached. The sub-assemblies or equipment modules are generally massive and of small volume so that they act as a rigid mass attached to the lightweight integral structure via an equivalent lateral spring constant and viscous damper. For example, the guidance package and the rocket engine of a ballistic missile are usually attached fore and aft of the missile integral tank structure. Each of these elements can be quite rigid and will act as a separate mass from the integral tank structure. The proper choice of the equivalent lateral spring constant and viscous damper of the attaching fixtures that hold the sub-assemblies to the basic lightweight missile or airframe integral structure will result in an optimum increase in modal damping for a particular beam-flexural mode of the completed structure. To determine the values of the proper equivalent spring constant and viscous coefficient, the dynamic principles underlying the Frahm damper are used by extending the analysis of the Frahm damper concept to include a general linear flexural beam which satisfies a linear partial differential equation which can be solved by the product of the solutions of two ordinary, linear differential equations. The extension of these principles is accomplished by deriving the solution of the attached sub-assembly to the integral structure through normal servomechanism analysis. This analysis uses the analytical relationships of the Evans or Root-Locus method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24277","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/24277/01105008.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1960.1105008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1960.1105008","startPage":"237","endPage":"246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of optimum beam flexural damping in a missile by application of root-locus techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1960","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105008/","displayDocTitle":"Design of optimum beam flexural damping in a missile by application of root-locus techniques","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of optimum beam flexural damping in a missile by application of root-locus techniques","sourcePdf":"01105008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03311S","chronDate":"Aug 1960","isNumber":"24277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","articleId":"1105008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105013,"authors":[{"name":"O.

It is demonstrated in this paper that certain types of nonlinear systems although being inherently stable may be driven into oscillatory modes not only by random signals but also by any high frequency periodic or nonperiodic signal possessing a certain energy content. It is of interest to note that the tendency for hunting and also the hunt frequency usually are completely independent of the frequency of the excitation signal, i.e., the phenomenon is of asynchronous nature. A general theory, the validity of which has been tested by both analog and digital means, is presented and utilized to demonstrate how this phenomenon may be predicted from information on circuit data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1960","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105013/","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1960","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A study of asynchronously excited oscillations in nonlinear control systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of asynchronously excited oscillations in nonlinear control systems","sourcePdf":"01105013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035624S","chronDate":"Aug 1960","isNumber":"24277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1105013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105025,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The design problem is compounded by the loop-gain requirements for control of an aerodynamically unstable airframe in a dynamic wind environment. This paper presents a \"model feedback\" approach to this design problem in which the system does not attempt to \"adapt\" to body bending, but instead is contrived to ignore it. The vehicle-body feedbacks, required for stability and control, are synthesized by a combination of actual body motion and information from a model of the rigid body acted upon by the control force. Following an investigation of stability and response for this system, attention is focused on the problem of response to disturbances such as wind, gusts and shear.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24286","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/24286/01105190.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1961.1105190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1961.1105190","startPage":"135","endPage":"142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model feedback applied to flexible booster control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105190/","displayDocTitle":"Model feedback applied to flexible booster control","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"May 1961","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model feedback applied to flexible booster control","sourcePdf":"01105190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042657S","chronDate":"May 1961","isNumber":"24286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1105190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105201,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It is shown that in any single degree of freedom feedback configuration, the system response and especially its overshoot are inherently very sensitive to parameter variation. By means of a suitable transformation, the properties of the sensitivity function can be studied in terms of the usual continuous system frequency concepts, e.g., bandwidth and loop transmission shaping on the Bode plane. There is a basic limitation on the loop transmission bandwidth that can be obtained in any sampled-data feedback configuration. This limitation makes it impossible to secure the unlimited sensitivity reduction which is theoretically available in minimum phase continuous systems. It is shown how one must achieve a compromise between the values of the sampling period, the system response, and the sensitivity function. The design procedure is illustrated in detail with a numerical design problem in which there is substantial parameter variation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Continuous time systems","Control systems","Automatic control","Bandwidth","Sampling methods","Frequency","Feedback loop","Aircraft","Aerospace industry","Electrical equipment industry"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.1961.1105215","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/24287/01105215.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1961.1105215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The sensitivity problem in sampled-data feedback systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The sensitivity problem in sampled-data feedback systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105215/","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"September 1961","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1961","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The sensitivity problem in sampled-data feedback systems","sourcePdf":"01105215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025057S","chronDate":"Sep 1961","isNumber":"24287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1105215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1105217,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The robust control problem, i.e., the problem of designing accurate control systems in the presence of significant plant uncertainties, is classical. However, over the past 15 years, significant new theory has been developed for the solution of this problem, especially with respect to linear multivariable systems characterized in the frequency domain, and the term robust control for this classical problem is only of recent vintage (1972). Some of the major contributions of modern robust control theory include the development of synthesis techniques for robust stabilization, and H\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nand\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H^{\\infty}</tex>\nsensitivity optimization of multivariable systems. In this review, we confine the term robust control to the design of fixed controllers. Thus, only nonadaptive or nonself-tuning solutions to the problem of controlling uncertain systems are reviewed. Finally, it should be noted that the review is largely limited to the literature published in IEEE journals and conference proceedings, and some English-language journals. It is, of course, recognized that many significant related contributions have appeared elsewhere.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105273/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","publicationDate":"April 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A historical review of robust control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A historical review of robust control","sourcePdf":"01105273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065545S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"24289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1105273","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105274,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The closed-loop performance of such endpoint force control systems has been observed in the laboratory to be limited and unsatisfactory for industrial applications. This article discusses the particular dynamic properties of robot systems that can lead to instability and limit performance. A series of lumped-parameter models is developed in an effort to predict the closed-loop dynamics of a force-controlled single-axis arm. The models include some effects of robot structural dynamics, sensor compliance, and workpiece dynamics. The qualitative analysis shows that the robot dynamics contribute to force-controlled instability.

The spherical wrist actuator is developed through analytic studies and the design of position and torque control instrumentation. The end effector is a micromanipulator based on the principle of in-parallel mechanisms.

A summary of the underlying theory is presented, with emphasis on how controllability requirements affect the choice of the film's spatial distribution. The requisite film controller has a linearly varying spatial distribution that facilitates the control of both even- and odd-order vibrational modes. Experimental results are presented for the control of the beam's first three modes, using both the linearly varying as well as a uniform spatial distribution. The linearly varying distribution is shown to be effective in controlling both even- and odd-order modes, serving to increase the modal loss factors by up to a factor of 4.5. In addition, the experimental results are found to corroborate a simplified computer model of the controller.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/37/24291/01105349.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MCS.1987.1105349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.1987.1105349","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active vibration control of a simply supported beam using a spatially distributed actuator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105349/","displayDocTitle":"Active vibration control of a simply supported beam using a spatially distributed actuator","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active vibration control of a simply supported beam using a spatially distributed actuator","sourcePdf":"01105349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060169S","chronDate":"August  1987","isNumber":"24291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"81","articleId":"1105349","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105392,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The approach is based on the method of generalized quantized compensation. The mathematical tools needed for the analysis are adapted from the discipline of statistical inference. In particular, decision theory is used. An important consequence of inexact measurement is that the problems of identification and of control cannot be considered separately. Decision theory is used as the link that logically relates the two. Current application of decision functions has mostly been limited to cases where the unknown parameters to be determined can take on only discrete values. In view of the continuous variation of the parameters, assumptions that they take on discrete values lead to results whose optimality is not justifiable. Several possible extensions are presented. In addition, a sequential decision scheme that can be applied to reduce expected measurement time is presented. An attempt is made to make the statistical analysis largely self-contained and lucid to those not familiar with statistical inference procedures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1962","publicationDate":"January 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decision-making in adaptive control systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision-making in adaptive control systems","sourcePdf":"01105402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035535S","chronDate":"Jan 1962","isNumber":"24294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1105402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105404,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A study is made here of an adaptive system which varies the sampling frequency by measuring a system parameter. It is shown that a sampler followed by a zero-order hold whose sampling period is controlled by the absolute value of the first derivative of the error signal will be a more \"efficient\" sampler than a fixed-frequency sampler. That is, over a given time interval, fewer samples are needed with the variable-frequency system than with a fixed-frequency system while maintaining essentially the same response characteristics. Analog computer studies of simple Type I and Type II sampled-data servo systems with error sampling and unity feedback verified the method. Standard analog computer components were used to set up a simulated servo system, a rate detector, absolute-value detector, a voltage-controlled oscillator, and a sampler and zero-order hold. The system described reduced the number of samples required for response to a step input to about three-quarters that required in a fixed-sampling-frequency system. Over a long period of time savings in the number of samples required can be expected to be between 25 and 50 per cent.

In exacting feedback problems where the parameter variations or disturbances are large, the resulting single-loop transmission may require a larger gain and bandwidth than that of the plant. The added feedback compensation networks then have rising frequency characteristics and make the system very sensitive to HF noise in the feedback path. It is shown how a multiple-loop design permits the attainment of the same benefits of feedback, but with considerably less sensitivity to the HF noise. The basic problem is how to divide up the feedback burden most efficiently among the various loop transmission functions. Detailed procedures for this purpose are presented in the paper. The treatment is restricted to cascade-type plants.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1962.1105448","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/24296/01105448.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1962.1105448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of multiple-loop feedback control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1962","displayDocTitle":"Design of multiple-loop feedback control systems","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1962","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multiple-loop feedback control systems","sourcePdf":"01105448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063574S","chronDate":"Apr 1962","isNumber":"24296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1105448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105456,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This work evaluates the mean-square error caused by sampling and quantization at the output of a linear network which contains a single quantizer. A detailed answer is given to the question, \"Given quantized samples of a signal which is a sample function of a random process, what is the optimum linear filter for recovering the signal from its samples?\" This filter is determined and its characteristics are summarized graphically for a specific example. A comparison with the conventional hold circuit shows that the optimum filter is much better if high accuracy is required and quantization is coarse. The difference in performance between the two filters is small when the accuracy requirement is low and the quantization is fine. Also included as Appendix V is a survey of the general quantization errors problem, as it appears in the areas of digital computation and numerical analysis, and a study of multiquantizer networks. It is found that extension of the method to networks which contain more than one quantizer is impractical, if not impossible.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Quantization","Nonlinear filters","Signal processing","Computer errors","Input variables","Laboratories","Signal sampling","Random processes","Circuits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105458","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1962.1105458","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/24296/01105458.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1962.1105458","startPage":"58","endPage":"68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24296","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On errors introduced by combined sampling and quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On errors introduced by combined sampling and quantization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1962","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1962","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On errors introduced by combined sampling and quantization","sourcePdf":"01105458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028979S","chronDate":"Apr 1962","isNumber":"24296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1105458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105464,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The accuracy of the method is limited by the accuracy of the describing function approximation. In addition to offering a rapid solution to what has been regarded as a time consuming problem, the method gives the designer sufficient insight into the behavior of the system to allow the intelligent choice of compensating networks to improve system performance. A numerical example is used as a vehicle for discussion of compensation, and experimental results are presented to verify the analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105464/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1962","publicationDate":"July 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"7","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Closed loop response of nonlinear systems by a functional transformation approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed loop response of nonlinear systems by a functional transformation approach","sourcePdf":"01105464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056408S","chronDate":"July  1962","isNumber":"24297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1105464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105469,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is shown that the sensitivity function of a sampled-data system containing no continuous feedback is theoretically limited if the plant possesses low-pass response characteristics. Since the limitation imposed by sampling can be removed by continuous feedback, consideration is given to a sampled-data system containing a continuous minor-loop feedback path. A sensitivity function is derived which measures the individual effectiveness of the inner and outer loops in desensitizing the system, thereby providing the basis for a realistic design approach.

It has been used in control theory and its application to control systems considered as recursive processes has been investigated. The principle is valid for nonlinear systems and can be used to establish stability in nonlinear control. Also, because the existence of a solution can be obtained by a recursive algorithm, the principle can be used in adaptive or learning systems to generate a desired output function recursively.

Although the two system concepts are fundamentally different, the optimal-control theory in both cases generates constant feedback gains which modify the plant dynamics so that the resultant system response approaches that of the model. Each synthesis method produces an optimal-control law that has a closed-form solution and minimizes an integral quadratic performance index involving both system errors and control motions. The first type of model-following system is generated by incorporating the model only in the performance index. The integral square error between the model and the system is minimized by one term in the performance index. The basic idea in this system is to alter, by the feedback, the coefficients in the equations of motion for the plant so that these coefficients approach those of the model. The feedback control obtained from this method depends on the solution of the matrix Riccati equation, and also on a product of constant matrices. For an infinite weight on the error term in the performance index, the solution of the Riccati equation approaches zero. The second type of model-following system incorporates the model as part of the control system, and places it ahead of the plant as a prefilter. The difference between the model output and the plant output is minimized in the performance index. The resulting system has not only feedback gains for the plant state variables but also feedforward gains for the model state variables. Evaluation shows that the feedback gains are independent of the model, and are exactly those which would be obtained for the normal regulator problem. The feedforward gains depend on both plant and model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The characteristics of model-following systems as synthesized by optimal control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1964.1105757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/24306/01105757.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1964.1105757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1964","displayDocTitle":"The characteristics of model-following systems as synthesized by optimal control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"October 1964","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The characteristics of model-following systems as synthesized by optimal control","sourcePdf":"01105757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036036S","chronDate":"Oct 1964","isNumber":"24306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"128","articleId":"1105757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105763,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The devastating storms that struck large parts of Europe in late 1999 destroyed the equivalent of several years of normal forest harvesting, amounting to very large economical sums. Therefore, rapid mapping of damaged areas is of major importance for assessment of short-term actions as well as for long-term reforestation purposes. In this paper, the use of airborne CARABAS-II very high frequency (VHF) (20-90 MHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for high spatial resolution mapping of wind-thrown forests has been investigated and evaluated. The investigation was performed at a test site located in southern Sweden and dominated by Norway spruce forests. A regression model estimating radar backscattering amplitude prior to the storm was developed. The estimated amplitudes were compared to measured amplitudes after the storm. The results clearly show that the backscattering amplitude, at a given stem volume, is considerably higher for wind-thrown forests than for unaffected forests. Furthermore, the backscattering from fully harvested storm-damaged areas was, as expected, significantly lower than from unaffected stands. These findings imply that VHF SAR imagery has potential for mapping wind-thrown forests. However, to prevent ambiguities in increased backscattering caused by normal stem volume growth or wind-fellings, multitemporal change detection techniques using VHF SAR images acquired prior to and after wind-fellings would be preferable.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/24315/01105902.pdf","startPage":"2170","endPage":"2175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2002.804913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2002.804913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of storm-damaged forested areas using airborne CARABAS-II VHF SAR image data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backscatter","Storms","Amplitude estimation","Europe","Frequency","Synthetic aperture radar","Spatial resolution","Performance evaluation","Testing","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forestry","vegetation mapping","remote sensing by radar","radar imaging","radar applications","synthetic aperture radar","airborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne CARABAS-II VHF SAR image data","storm-damaged forested areas","forested land","devastating storms","Europe","AD 1999","synthetic aperture radar","wind-thrown forests","southern Sweden","Norway spruce","radar backscattering amplitude","stem volume","multitemporal change detection techniques","storm damage assessment","mapping","long-term reforestation","20 to 90 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Detection of storm-damaged forested areas using airborne CARABAS-II VHF SAR image data","volume":"40","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1105902/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2002","accessionNumber":"7497410","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of storm-damaged forested areas using airborne CARABAS-II VHF SAR image data","sourcePdf":"01105902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072816S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"24315","isNumber":"24315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"1105902","articleId":"1105902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105905,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/24315/1105905/1105905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Xie (S'98) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and from the Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1993 and 1996, respectively.

Therefore, speckle reduction is a prerequisite for many SAR image processing tasks. In this paper, we develop a speckle reduction algorithm by fusing the wavelet Bayesian denoising technique with Markov-random-field-based image regularization. Wavelet coefficients are modeled independently and identically by a two-state Gaussian mixture model, while their spatial dependence is characterized by a Markov random field imposed on the hidden state of Gaussian mixtures. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate hyperparameters and specify the mixture model, and the iterated-conditional-modes method is implemented to optimize the state configuration. The noise-free wavelet coefficients are finally estimated by a shrinkage function based on local weighted averaging of the Bayesian estimator. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms standard wavelet denoising techniques in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio and the equivalent-number-of-looks measures in most cases. It also achieves better performance than the refined Lee filter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR speckle reduction using wavelet denoising and Markov random field modeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2002.802473","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/24315/01105905.pdf","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2002.802473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"SAR speckle reduction using wavelet denoising and Markov random field modeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1105905/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Oct 2002","accessionNumber":"7497413","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR speckle reduction using wavelet denoising and Markov random field modeling","sourcePdf":"01105905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172949S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"24315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"267","xplore-issue":"24315","articleId":"1105905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1105913,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Due to system gain/efficiency changes that can be expected to occur during the course of a shuttle or satellite mission, it is essential to employ a calibration approach that can be implemented on-orbit, preferably repeatable at least a few times per orbit. For wavelengths less than about 550 nm, in situ calibration can be accomplished via normalization to high-altitude nearly molecular scattering regions. However, for longer wavelengths beyond about 800 nm, particularly the popular Nd: YAG fundamental wavelength at 1064 nm, the Rayleigh normalization approach becomes questionable due to both an inherently weaker signal and a stronger, variable, and somewhat unknown aerosol scattering contribution. For lidars operating at both longer and shorter wavelengths, a viable approach is to retrieve the longer wavelength calibrations ratioed to the shorter wavelength calibrations via comparisons of spectral backscatter from known/quantifiable scatterers. Cirrus clouds are good for this purpose because they occur at high altitudes with significant frequency and provide strong nearly spectrally flat backscatter. This paper presents both the molecular normalization and cirrus spectral backscatter ratio calibration approaches, including results obtained from case studies of lidar data collected during the LITE shuttle mission. Attention is focused on developing a simple autonomous approach applicable to satellite lidar missions such as Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS).","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/24315/01105915.pdf","startPage":"2285","endPage":"2290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2002.802464","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2002.802464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105915","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Calibration","Backscatter","Satellites","Rayleigh scattering","Neodymium","Aerosols","Clouds","Frequency","Geoscience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric techniques","clouds","aerosols","remote sensing by laser beam","remote sensing by laser beam","optical radar","optical radar","calibration","calibration","geophysical techniques","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmosphere","meteorology","cloud","aerosol","geophysical measurement technique","land surface","terrain mapping","laser remote sensing","lidar","spaceborne calibration","cirrus","molecular backscatter return","CALIPSO","GLAS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105915/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Spaceborne lidar calibration from cirrus and molecular backscatter returns","accessionNumber":"7497423","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1105915/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spaceborne lidar calibration from cirrus and molecular backscatter returns","sourcePdf":"01105915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048982S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"24315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"24315","articleId":"1105915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105917,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The former exploits the undecimated discrete wavelet transform, which is an octave bandpass representation achieved from a conventional discrete wavelet transform by omitting all decimators and upsampling the wavelet filter bank. The latter relies on the generalized Laplacian pyramid, which is another oversampled structure obtained by recursively subtracting from an image an expanded decimated lowpass version. Both the methods selectively perform spatial-frequencies spectrum substitution from an image to another. In both schemes, context dependency is exploited by thresholding the local correlation coefficient between the images to be merged, to avoid injection of spatial details that are not likely to occur in the target image. Unlike other multiscale fusion schemes, both the present decompositions are not critically subsampled, thus avoiding possible impairments in the fused images, due to missing cancellation of aliasing terms.

Both unsupervised and supervised classification approaches were used to create these products to evaluate relative merits and to develop models that would be useful to natural resource managers at higher spatial resolution than has been available previously. Ground surveys made by us in late October and early December 2000 and again in May, August, and October 2001 and May 2002 provided ground truth data for 20 land cover types. Locations of pure land cover types recorded with global positioning system (GPS) data from these surveys were used to extract spectral end-members for training and testing supervised land cover classification models. Unsupervised exploratory models were also developed using spatial-spectral windows and projection pursuit (PP), a class of algorithms suitable for extracting multimodal views of the data. PP projections were clustered by ISODATA to produce an unsupervised classification. Supervised models, which relied on the GPS data, used only spectral inputs because for some categories in particular areas, labeled data consisted of isolated single-pixel waypoints. Both approaches to the classification problem produced consistent results for some categories such as Spartina alterniflora, although there were differences for other categories. Initial models for supervised classification based on 112 HyMAP spectra, labeled in ground surveys, obtained reasonably consistent results for many of the dominant categories, with a few exceptions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105918/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","volume":"40","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","accessionNumber":"7497426","publicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1105918/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic classification of land cover on Smith Island, VA, using HyMAP imagery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic classification of land cover on Smith Island, VA, using HyMAP imagery","sourcePdf":"01105918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103004S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"24315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"24315","articleId":"1105918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1105919,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

The wavelet transform features are evaluated using an automated statistical classifier. The system is tested using hyperspectral data for various agricultural applications. The experimental results demonstrate the promising discriminant capability of the wavelet-based features.

A novel measurement technique was utilized, based on a wideband channel sounder and a spherical dual-polarized antenna array at the receiver. Data were collected over 9 km of continuous measurement routes, both indoor and outdoor. Our results show that in non-line-of-sight situations, the power distribution in elevation has a shape of a double-sided exponential function, with different slopes on the negative and positive sides of the peak. The slopes and the peak elevation angle depend on the environment and base-station antenna height. The cross-polarization power ratio varied within 6.6 and 11.4 dB, being lowest for indoor and highest for urban microcell environments. We applied the experimental data for analysis of the mean effective gain (MEG) of several mobile handset antenna configurations, with and without the user's head. The obtained MEG values varied from approximately -5 dBi in free space to less than -11 dBi beside the head model. These values are considerably lower than what is typically used in system specifications. The result shows that considering only the maximum gain or total efficiency of the antenna is not enough to describe its performance in practical operating conditions. For most antennas, the environment type has little effect on the MEG, but clear differences exist between antennas. The effect of the user's head on the MEG depends on the antenna type and on which side of the head the user holds the handset.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.800639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105924.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.800639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","startPage":"823","endPage":"838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angular power distribution and mean effective gain of mobile antenna in different propagation environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Angular power distribution and mean effective gain of mobile antenna in different propagation environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105924/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486409","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1105924/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angular power distribution and mean effective gain of mobile antenna in different propagation environments","sourcePdf":"01105924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.520204S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1105925,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Soon Kang","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea","Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/24316/1105925/1105925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chang Soon Kang received the B.S. degree from Kyungpook National University in 1984, the M.S. degree from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1986, both in electronics engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in 2001.","Since 1989, he has been with the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), where he was involved in developing the CDMA Cellular System from 1989 to 1996.

The signal power is characterized as the relative power level of wideband and narrowband users according to the spreading bandwidth, spectral overlay ratio, and the number of spreading codes assigned to a user in single-cell and multiple-cell environments. The capacities of the overlay systems are then analyzed. The results of the analysis show that the single-code technique yields better performance than the multicode scheme in terms of the capacities of the overlay systems. Furthermore, the use of a multicode technique for wideband subsystems and a single-code scheme for narrowband subsystems is desirable for enhancing the performance of CDMA overlay systems.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.802523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105925.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.802523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","startPage":"839","endPage":"854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacities of spectrally overlaid single-code and multicode CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacities of spectrally overlaid single-code and multicode CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105925/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486410","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1105925/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacities of spectrally overlaid single-code and multicode CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01105925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124856S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1105926,"authors":[{"name":"So Ryoung Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/24316/1105926/1105926-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["So Ryoung Park (S'99\u2013M'01) was born in Daegu, Korea, on November 22, 1974.

It utilizes a combination of the three elementary multiple-access schemes: frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA) and code-division multiple access (CDMA). Multiple-access interference (MAI) and intersymbol interference (ISI) are combated by joint detection of all simultaneous signals of the same cell, achieving a high spectrum efficiency. The authors have been involved in the implementation of a first experimental hardware setup of a TD-CDMA mobile radio system. Important objectives of this project are the demonstration of the economic feasibility of CDMA receivers utilizing joint detection and the performance verification of TD-CDMA by measurement campaigns. The authors present a new way of modeling the TD-CDMA receiver in the form of a data-flow model. This model serves as a starting point for the systematic design of an efficient software architecture for TD-CDMA based on a multiprocessor system. The complete digital signal processing (DSP) of a mobile terminal or of a base station can be implemented on a single Texas Instruments digital signal processor TMS320C80. Measurement results obtained by first field trials are presented.

We initially derive the uplink capacity satisfying the QoS constraint on radio links in a multiclass multicode code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system. Based on the derived capacity, the number of channel elements, which is one of the system resources, is determined. Then, we define the QoS parameters associated with connection processes. To guarantee the defined QoS at the connection level, under given channel elements, we propose a channel-assignment scheme with dynamic priority adjustment (DPA). The proposed scheme gives multipriority to different traffic classes. Real-time classes can preempt non-real-time classes with restricted preemptive priority. Such restriction is regulated by preemption-free code channels and a buffer threshold for non-real-time classes. Among real-time classes, different priorities are assigned to each traffic class by code reservation parameters. These multipriority parameters are dynamically adjusted in order to guarantee different QoS requirements. We analyze the DPA scheme by the matrix-geometric method, and evaluate the performance of each traffic class. The results show that the proposed scheme flexibly guarantees QoS depending on traffic loading condition and achieves high channel utilization.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.801766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105932.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.801766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel assignment with QoS guarantees for a multiclass multicode CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105932/","displayDocTitle":"Channel assignment with QoS guarantees for a multiclass multicode CDMA system","volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486417","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1105932/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel assignment with QoS guarantees for a multiclass multicode CDMA system","sourcePdf":"01105932.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115439S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1105935,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

The new approach produces a set of fading waveforms, one waveform associated with each receiver element, in which the waveforms are appropriately correlated to take into account the spread, or dispersion, in the azimuth (arrival angle) of the received signal. The new method is an extension of the Jakes (1974) method of simulating fading in which the appropriate correlation of the set of waveforms is accomplished by directly considering the azimuth of scatterers in a particular distribution about the mobile transmitter. The models used for this cluster of scatterers are a ring and a disk of scatterers. Further modifications of the disk model permit the generation of fading waveforms which are correlated in a manner which reflect actual field measurements of azimuth dispersion. Analytical correlation of these models is reviewed for purposes of verification with the waveforms generated by the method.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.801742","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105935.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.801742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"968","endPage":"977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Jakes fading model for antenna arrays incorporating azimuth spread","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"The Jakes fading model for antenna arrays incorporating azimuth spread","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105935/","volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1105935/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486420","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Jakes fading model for antenna arrays incorporating azimuth spread","sourcePdf":"01105935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06323S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1105936,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Three of them are new, and the other two are well known, but their performance, however, has not been studied in detail up until now. All procedures are universally valid so that they can be applied to any specified or measured multipath power-delay profile. The performance of the proposed methods is investigated with respect to important characteristic quantities such as the frequency correlation function (FCF), average delay, and delay spread. The method found to perform best is the so-called L/sup P/-norm method (LPNM). This procedure is applied to measurement data of multipath power-delay profiles collected in different propagation environments. It is shown that the realization complexity of tapped-delay line-based simulation models for fading channels can be reduced considerably by using the LPNM.

In the proposed system, the outer code decoder and the inner turbo code decoder interact to achieve both good bit error and frame error performance. The outer code decoder helps the inner turbo code decoder to terminate its decoding iteration while the inner turbo code decoder provides soft-output information to the outer code decoder to carry out a reliability-based algebraic soft-decision decoding algorithm. In the case that outer code decoding fails, the outer code decoder instructs the inner code decoder to continue its decoding iterations until outer code decoding is successful or a preset maximum number of decoding iterations is reached. This interaction between outer and inner code decoders reduces decoding delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1105938/","accessionNumber":"7486423","displayDocTitle":"An interactive concatenated turbo coding system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interactive concatenated turbo coding system","sourcePdf":"01105938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061407S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1105940,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

Here, each group of Q carriers in the MC-CDMA system is applied to its own M-element smart antenna at the base station (BS). The smart antennas are separated by a distance that ensures that signals generated by each smart antenna are independent. Applying proper time-varying phases to array elements of each smart antenna array, the beam pattern is carefully controlled to generate a mainlobe at the position of the intended user and small oscillations in the beam pattern. This beam-pattern oscillation creates a time-varying channel with a controllable coherence time and a time diversity benefit at the receiver. Employing MC-CDMA with the proposed antenna array at the BS, we achieve: 1) directionality, which supports space-division multiple access (SDMA); 2) a time diversity gain; 3) increased capacity and performance via MC-CDMA's ability to support both CDMA and frequency diversity benefits. Hence, merging MC-CDMA and BS antenna arrays in an innovative fashion, we achieve high performance at the mobile via joint frequency-time diversity, and high network capacity via joint space-code division multiple access.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.800628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105941.pdf","startPage":"1030","endPage":"1039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.800628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oscillating-beam smart antenna arrays and multicarrier systems: achieving transmit diversity, frequency diversity, and directionality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105941/","displayDocTitle":"Oscillating-beam smart antenna arrays and multicarrier systems: achieving transmit diversity, frequency diversity, and directionality","volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486426","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1105941/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oscillating-beam smart antenna arrays and multicarrier systems: achieving transmit diversity, frequency diversity, and directionality","sourcePdf":"01105941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059635S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1105944,"authors":[{"name":"Ju Ho Lee","affiliation":["Global Standards and Strategy Team, Telecommunication Research & Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/24316/1105944/1105944-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ju Ho Lee received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Taejon, Korea, in 1993, 1995, and 2000, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","Currently, he is a Senior Engineer of Samsung Electronics Co., Suwon-Si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, working on standardization of mobile communications.

In the uplink of DS-CDMA systems, however, the base station receiver typically knows the spreading waveforms of the users within its cell but does not know those of the users in other cells. We propose a partial zero-forcing adaptive minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receiver for the DS-CDMA uplink utilizing the spreading waveforms known at the base station as well as training data. The proposed receiver first removes the intracell interference using a linear filter based on the knowledge of the spreading waveforms of the interfering users within the cell. Then the intercell interference remaining in the output of the linear filter is mitigated by adaptive MMSE detection. To speed up the convergence of the adaptive filter weights without loss of the steady-state performance, we develop a modified least mean square (LMS) algorithm based on the canonical representation of the filter weights. It is shown through analysis and simulation results that the proposed receiver improves the convergence speed and the steady-state performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.800633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105944.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.800633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial zero-forcing adaptive MMSE receiver for DS-CDMA uplink in multicell environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partial zero-forcing adaptive MMSE receiver for DS-CDMA uplink in multicell environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486429","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1105944/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial zero-forcing adaptive MMSE receiver for DS-CDMA uplink in multicell environments","sourcePdf":"01105944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047624S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1105945,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The receiver is shown to be capable of multiple-access interference (MAI) suppression and multipath diversity combining without the knowledge of other users' signature sequences. It maximizes output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the aid of a new chip filter which exploits the cyclostationarity of the received signal and combines all paths of the desired user that fall within its supported time span. The performance of the LMMSE receiver is compared with that of the coherent selective RAKE receiver. The achieved gain is on the order of 0.6-1.8 dB in dense multipath environments of current narrow-band settings and nonuniform power distribution scenarios of next-generation CDMA systems.

We formulate and examine the performance of several two-dimensional linear filter structures, which are all based on minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion but differ in how the MMSE problems are defined in the temporal and spatial domains, i.e., jointly or in cascade. It is shown that while the joint optimum MMSE filter achieves the maximum signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) among all possible matrix filters, the constrained optimum MMSE filter which results in a single temporal and single spatial filter, outperforms all combined single-user/multiple-user approaches and cascaded optimization approaches either uniformly or asymptotically. The constrained optimum MMSE filter is near-far resistant in all but very highly loaded systems and enjoys low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.800616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105946.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.800616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined multiuser detection and beamforming for CDMA systems: filter structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105946/","displayDocTitle":"Combined multiuser detection and beamforming for CDMA systems: filter structures","volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486431","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1105946/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined multiuser detection and beamforming for CDMA systems: filter structures","sourcePdf":"01105946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065156S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1105947,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghua Li","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Qinghua Li received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 1992, the M.S. degree in signal processing from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, in 2001.","From 1995 to 1996, he was with a government institution and a company, the Telecommunications Research Bureau of Guangdong Province and Ericsson Network System, Dallas, TX.

We develop an iterative multiuser receiver for turbo-coded CDMA systems with aperiodic spreading sequences operating in multipath fading, which exploits the power of both techniques. The key innovation in the proposed receiver is a low-complexity soft multiuser detector which uses the same decision statistic as the conventional RAKE receiver (i.e., the outputs of the maximum ratio combiners for all the users), and performs soft-interference cancellation and instantaneous minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filtering. The soft multiuser detector has a complexity of O(K/sup 2/) per bit per iteration, where K is the number of users. A single-user receiver which employs a soft RAKE detector followed by a turbo decoder is also considered. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multiuser receiver offers more than 0.5-dB gain over the single-user RAKE receiver at a bit-error rate (BER) of 10/sup -3/ and even outperforms the single-user RAKE receiver operating in a single-user environment.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.801749","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105947.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.801749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo multiuser detection for turbo-coded CDMA in multipath fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Turbo multiuser detection for turbo-coded CDMA in multipath fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486432","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1105947/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo multiuser detection for turbo-coded CDMA in multipath fading channels","sourcePdf":"01105947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078333S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1105949,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/24316/1105949/1105949-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Jiang received the B.S. and M.S. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1985 and 1988, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Hong Kong, China, in 2000, all in electronic engineering.","From 1988 to 1996, he was with the Communication Department, Nanjing Automation Institute, as a Firmware Engineer.

An average SNR analysis is developed and followed by numerical examples to illustrate relative performance merits among modulation formats, including offset quaternary phase-shift keying (OQPSK), minimum shift keying (MSK), sinusoidal frequency shift keying (SFSK), and time-domain raised-cosine shaped QPSK (TDRC). The channel filtering considered is based on Butterworth-type filters with varying 3-dB cutoff bandwidth, and the nonlinear amplification is modeled by amplitude hard limiting. The results obtained show little SNR performance differences between the cases of filtering alone and combined filtering and hard limiting. It is also found that for tighter filtering (one-sided 3-dB bandwidth on the order of half the chip rate), all modulations have comparable performance, but that for wider filter bandwidth values, differences become more noticeable, with SFSK and TDRC slightly better than MSK (on the order of 0.5 dB) and clearly outperforming OQPSK (by up to 1.5 dB). On the other hand, examples with strictly bandlimited signals employing frequency-domain Nyquist raised cosine (FDRC) filtering with a rolloff factor varying from zero to one showed a clear degradation in performance (by about 1 dB) due to the introduction of hard limiting. These schemes were also outperformed by all of OQPSK, MSK, SFSK, and TDRC modulations when combined with strict \"brick wall\" filtering, with SNR differences ranging from 1 to 2 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of filtering and nonlinear amplification on the performance of DS-CDMA with OQPSK-type modulations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.801761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105952.pdf","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.801761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"The effects of filtering and nonlinear amplification on the performance of DS-CDMA with OQPSK-type modulations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1105952/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486437","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of filtering and nonlinear amplification on the performance of DS-CDMA with OQPSK-type modulations","sourcePdf":"01105952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077712S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1105953,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To confirm the designed link budget, the multibeam antenna pattern of COMETS' on-board antenna was measured while the airplane flew across two antenna beams. The antenna pattern matched the one measured in a ground test before launch. Two binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modems, one for pilot-assisted coherent detection and the other for multiple-symbol differential detection, were used to measure the bit-error rate (BER). The measured received signal energy per bit per noise power density (E/sub b//N/sub 0/) at a BER of 10/sup -4/ showed only a small degradation of about 1 dB from that measured in a translator loop-back test.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ka-band aeronautical satellite communications experiments using COMETS","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.801769","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105953.pdf","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.801769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Ka-band aeronautical satellite communications experiments using COMETS","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1105953/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486438","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ka-band aeronautical satellite communications experiments using COMETS","sourcePdf":"01105953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066982S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1105955,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The semi-autonomous systems combine the deployment advantages of autonomous vehicles with the performance advantages of fully automated highway systems (AHSs) in which vehicles operate cooperatively as a platoon. Unlike platoon systems, the semi-autonomous systems are immediately deployable on present day highways, where both manually driven and adaptive cruise controlled vehicles can coexist. Our theoretical results show that the proposed system is able to maintain smaller time gaps safely, is string stable, and is guaranteed to have smaller actuator inputs than a standard autonomous ACC system. The simulation results indicate that more accurate and smoother tracking, smaller time gaps, smaller control efforts, and increased robustness to vehicle dynamics are achieved by semi-autonomous control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105955.pdf","startPage":"1186","endPage":"1192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.800617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.800617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Control systems","Remotely operated vehicles","Automatic control","Automated highways","Road vehicles","Road safety","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicles","road traffic","adaptive control","safety","automotive electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control","highway safety","traffic flow capacity","automated highway systems","manually driven vehicles"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control systems","volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1105955/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486440","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control systems","sourcePdf":"01105955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039996S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":1105956,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The objective is to maximize data throughput while ensuring fairness among users and limiting queuing and transmission delays. The algorithm proposed assigns the packets to be transmitted to separate queues, one for each spatial zone within which packets require roughly equal resources from the target cell and impose equal interference on a neighbor cell. Packets are selected for transmission from the head of each queue until available resources for the slot interval are exhausted. Queues from which transmission would cause excessive out-of-cell interference are blocked. Fairness can be ensured by minimizing the delay variance for the remaining head-of-queue packets. We provide results for tradeoffs between throughput and fairness for constant and time-varying resource availability. Throughput drops significantly when fairness to distant mobiles is required.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink flow control for wireless CDMA packet data networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.800621","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105956.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.800621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Downlink flow control for wireless CDMA packet data networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1105956/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486441","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink flow control for wireless CDMA packet data networks","sourcePdf":"01105956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092689S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1105961,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The optical feeder allows compact and cost-effective base stations, easier channel assignment control, and. flexible communication systems. This paper investigates the simultaneous influence of the effects of the wireless channel such as fading and cochannel interference (CCI) and the effects of the optical channel, like shot noise and intermodulation distortion, introduced by the laser diode on the bit error rate (BER) performance of a fiber-fed microcellular system using the /spl pi/ /4-differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) modem scheme. The wireless channel is assumed to be a frequency-selective, slow, and CCI-limited Nakagami fading channel. The BER performance of the system is studied under various channel conditions using an exact model and a simplified model and a comparative study with a nonfiber-fed system is carried out. The tradeoff between the system capacity and the BER performance in fiber-optic microcellular (FOM) systems is also discussed. The results obtained justify the application of fiber-optic feeders as the remoting infrastructure for future microcellular systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/24316/01105964.pdf","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2002.800620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2002.800620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1105964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of fiber-fed microcellular networks using /spl pi//4-DQPSK in a frequency-selective CCI-limited Nakagami fading environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Frequency","Fading","Bit error rate","Optical signal processing","Communication system control","Control systems","Optical noise","Optical fiber communication","Centralized control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","cochannel interference","optical fibre subscriber loops","microcellular radio","differential phase shift keying","quadrature phase shift keying","intermodulation distortion","shot noise","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","fiber-fed microcellular networks","/spl pi//4-DQPSK","frequency-selective CCI-limited Nakagami fading environment","wide-band low-loss fiber-optic feeders","complex signal processing","control functions","central control station","base station","channel assignment control","flexible communication systems","cochannel interference","shot noise","intermodulation distortion","laser diode","bit error rate","BER","differential quadrature phase-shift keying","nonfiber-fed system","FOM","hybrid fiber/wireless systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1105964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of fiber-fed microcellular networks using /spl pi//4-DQPSK in a frequency-selective CCI-limited Nakagami fading environment","volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1105964/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486448","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of fiber-fed microcellular networks using /spl pi//4-DQPSK in a frequency-selective CCI-limited Nakagami fading environment","sourcePdf":"01105964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059312S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"24316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"24316","articleId":"1105964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1105966,"authors":[{"name":"Shan-An Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shan-An Yang","id":"37440429600"},{"name":"Jingshown Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jingshown Wu","id":"37279168200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"1105966","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"Accurate and efficient channel estimation is important in multiple-antenna communication systems in order to effectively reduce the mutual interference among different transmitting antennas. For a nondispersive channel that is modeled by a single tap for each transmitting and receiving antenna pair, the well-known Hadamard sequences can be applied to estimate the channel coefficients. However, for a dispersive channel that has multipath problem and is modeled by multiple taps, the optimal sequences must have both good autocorrelations and cross correlations. The existence of binary sequences with such good property is an open problem. In this paper, we devise an algorithm to find these sequence sets.

The composition of a workload involves two issues: (i) which benchmarks to select and (ii) which input data sets to select per benchmark. Unfortunately, it is impossible to select a huge number of benchmarks and respective input sets due to the large instruction counts per benchmark and due to limitations on the available simulation time. We use statistical data analysis techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis to efficiently explore the workload space. Within this workload space, different input data sets for a given benchmark can be displayed, a distance can be measured between program-input pairs that gives us an idea about their mutual behavioral differences and representative input data sets can be selected for the given benchmark. This methodology is validated by showing that program-input pairs that are close to each other in this workload space indeed exhibit similar behavior. The final goal is to select a limited set of representative benchmark-input pairs that span the complete workload space. Next to workload composition, there are a number of other possible applications, namely getting insight in the impact of input data sets on program behavior and profile-guided compiler optimizations.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2002.1106006","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/8167/24312/01106006.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2002.1106006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Workload design: selecting representative program-input pairs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1106006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106006/","displayDocTitle":"Workload design: selecting representative program-input pairs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7493015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106006/","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Workload design: selecting representative program-input pairs","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054839S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8167","isNumber":"24312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"24312","articleId":"1106006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1106011,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper we determine the potential benefits of application-supported device management for optimizing energy and performance. In particular, we consider application transformations that increase device idle times and inform the operating system about the length of each upcoming period of idleness. We assess the potential energy and performance benefits of this type of application support for a laptop disk. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a compiler framework for performing the transformations automatically for a disk device. Our experimental results demonstrate that unless applications are transformed, they cannot accrue any of the predicted benefits. In addition, they show that our compiler can produce almost the same performance and energy results that we obtain by hand-modifying applications. Overall, we find that the transformations we propose can reduce disk energy consumption from 55% to 89% with only a small degradation in performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106011/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106011/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7503572","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 2002","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application transformations for energy and performance-aware device management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application transformations for energy and performance-aware device management","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094126S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8167","isNumber":"24312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"24312","articleId":"1106011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1106018,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenlin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"],"lastName":"Zhenlin Wang","id":"37421892800"},{"name":"K.S.

Most architectures use set-associative caches with LRU replacement policies to combine fast access with relatively low miss rates. To improve replacement decisions in set-associative caches, we develop a new set of compiler algorithms that predict which data will and will not be reused and provide these hints to the architecture. We prove that the hints either match or improve hit rates over LRU. We describe a practical one-bit cache-line tag implementation of our algorithm, called evict-me. On a cache replacement, the architecture will replace a line for which the evict-me bit is set, or if none is set, it will use the LRU bits. We implement our compiler analysis and its output in the Scale compiler. On a variety of scientific programs, using the evict-me algorithm in both the level 1 and 2 caches improves simulated cycle times by up to 34% over the LRU policy by increasing hit rates. In addition, a combination of simple hardware prefetching and evict-me works together to further improve performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106018/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"7493016","publicationDate":"2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106018/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using the compiler to improve cache replacement decisions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the compiler to improve cache replacement decisions","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0826S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8167","isNumber":"24312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"24312","articleId":"1106018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1106159,"authors":[{"name":"F.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hardware implementation of triangle mesh decompression. The decompressor can be added at the front-end of a 3D graphics card sitting on the PCI/AGP bus. It can reduce the bandwidth requirement on the bus between the host and the graphics card by up to 80% compared to standard triangle mesh representations.

The objective is to improve the programmability of FPGAs, or in other words, the productivity of the FPGA programmer. We describe (1) the module generation library PAM-Blox II, the second generation of object-oriented module generators in C++, targeted at computing with FPGAs, and (2) examples of design tradeoffs and performance results using redundant representations for addition and multiplication, and technology mapping of comparison and elementary function evaluation. PAM-Blox II is built on top of a set of extensions to the gate level FPGA design library PamDC to provide a more efficient, portable, scalable, and maintainable module generator library. Using PAM-Blox II we demonstrate a simplified interface to bit-level programability. The simplification results from the bottom-up approach and a close coupling of architecture generation, module generation and gate level CAD. The tradeoffs for the module generators are based on trading area for speed and hand-optimizing technology mapping to the specific FPGA technology. As an example, we show that redundant number representations hold one key to unleashing the full potential of reconfigurability on the bit-level. The presented module generators are applied to encryption and compression to show the impact of the bit-level optimizations on application performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Libraries","Algorithm design and analysis","Programming profession","Partitioning algorithms","Productivity","Design automation","Cryptography","Argon","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","C++ language","object-oriented programming","compiler generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAM-Blox II","C++ module generation","FPGAs","flexible module generation","compiler","module generation library","object-oriented module generators","bit-level programmability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1106662","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106662","startPage":"67","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106662.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106662/","displayDocTitle":"PAM-Blox II: design and evaluation of C++ module generation for computing with FPGAs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7510382","htmlLink":"/document/1106662/","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAM-Blox II: design and evaluation of C++ module generation for computing with FPGAs","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106662.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045966S","chronDate":"2002","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1106662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1106663,"authors":[{"name":"H.

These architectures offer performance advantages for application domains such as image processing, where the use of customized pipelines exploits the inherent coarse-grain parallelism. In this paper we describe a set of program analyses and an implementation that map a sequential and un-annotated C program into a pipelined implementation running on a set of FPGAs, each with multiple external memories. Based on well-known parallel computing analysis techniques, our algorithms perform unrolling for operator parallelization, reuse and data layout for memory parallelization and precise communication analysis. We extend these techniques for FPGA-based systems to automatically partition the application data and computation into custom pipeline stages, taking into account the available FPGA and interconnect resources. We illustrate the analysis components by way of an example, a machine vision program. We present the algorithm results, derived with minimal manual intervention, which demonstrate the potential of this approach for automatically deriving pipelined designs from high-level sequential specifications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis","Parallel processing","Performance analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Image processing","Computer applications","Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","computer vision","parallelising compilers","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coarse-grain pipelining","multiple FPGA architectures","reconfigurable systems","custom computing machines","application-specific architectures","application domains","program analyses","data layout","memory parallelization","custom pipeline stages","machine vision program"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1106663","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106663","startPage":"77","endPage":"86","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106663.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106663/","displayDocTitle":"Coarse-grain pipelining on multiple FPGA architectures","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7510383","htmlLink":"/document/1106663/","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coarse-grain pipelining on multiple FPGA architectures","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08331S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8168","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"24313","articleId":"1106663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1106664,"authors":[{"name":"S.

String-matching speed is often the main factor limiting NIDS performance. String-matching performance can be dramatically improved by using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs); accordingly, a \"regular-expression to FPGA circuit\" module generator has been developed. The module generator extracts strings from the Snort NIDS rule-set, generates a regular expression that matches all extracted strings, synthesizes a FPGA-based string matching circuit, and generates an EDIF netlist that can be processed by Xilinx software to create an FPGA bitstream. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by comparing the performance of the FPGA-based string matcher against the software-based GNU regex program. The FPGA-based string matcher exceeds the performance of the software-based system by 600x for large patterns.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106666.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"120","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1106666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assisting network intrusion detection with reconfigurable hardware","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Hardware","Circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Automatic test pattern generation","Test pattern generators","Pattern matching","Java","Databases","Payloads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["string matching","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures","compiler generators","computer network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network intrusion detection","reconfigurable hardware","string matching","packet payloads","field-programmable gate arrays","module generator","EDIF netlist","Xilinx software","software-based GNU regex program"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Assisting network intrusion detection with reconfigurable hardware","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106666/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7510386","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assisting network intrusion detection with reconfigurable hardware","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066409S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8168","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"24313","articleId":"1106666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1106667,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Consequently, route time can be a significant overhead cost reducing the achievable net benefits of dynamic configuration generation. BY adding hardware to accelerate routing, we show that it is possible to compute routes in one thousandth the time of a traditional, software router and achieve routes that are within 5% of the state-of-the-art offline routing algorithms for a sample set of application netlists and within 25% for a set of difficult synthetic benchmarks. We further outline how strategic use of parallelism can allow the total route time to scale substantially less than linearly in graph size. We detail the source of the benefits in our approach and survey a range of options for hardware assistance that van, from a speedup of over 10/spl times/ with modest hardware overhead to speedups in excess of 1000/spl times/.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106675.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1106675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-assisted fast routing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Hardware","Acceleration","Runtime","Costs","AC generators","Parallel processing","Software design","Algorithm design and analysis","Software algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","circuit layout CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-assisted fast routing","field-programmable devices reconfigurability","computing tasks","instance-specific configurations","software router"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-assisted fast routing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106675/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7510395","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-assisted fast routing","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094081S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8168","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"24313","articleId":"1106675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1106676,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

Through the combined use of simulation, user input, and program analysis, we demonstrate a methodology for precision analysis that can aid the developer in focusing their manual precision optimization efforts.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106677","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106677.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precis: a design-time precision analysis tool","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1106677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106677/","displayDocTitle":"Precis: a design-time precision analysis tool","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7510397","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106677/","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precis: a design-time precision analysis tool","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.225391S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8168","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"24313","articleId":"1106677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1106678,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These compiler tools can apply extensive transformations that exploit the parallelism inherent in the computations. However, the transformations can have a major impact on the chip area (number of logic blocks) used on the FPGA. It is imperative therefore that the compiler user be provided with feedback indicating how much space is being used. In this paper we present a fast compile-time area estimation technique to guide the compiler optimizations. Experimental results show that our technique achieves an accuracy within 2.5% for small image-processing operators, and within 5.0% for larger benchmarks, as compared to the usual post-compilation synthesis tool estimations. The estimation time is in the order of milliseconds as compared to several minutes for a synthesis tool.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106678.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106678","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast area estimation to support compiler optimizations in FPGA-based reconfigurable systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast area estimation to support compiler optimizations in FPGA-based reconfigurable systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106678/","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1106678/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7510398","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast area estimation to support compiler optimizations in FPGA-based reconfigurable systems","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106678.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088728S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8168","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"24313","articleId":"1106678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1106680,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Then we address entropy decoding and propose a strategy to partially break the data dependency related to variable-length decoding. Three VLDs (VLD-1, VLD-2, VLD-3) instructions which can return 1, 2, or 3 symbols, respectively, are subsequently analyzed. After completing the DSE, we determined that VLD-2 instruction leads to the most efficient entropy decoding in terms of instruction cycles and FPGA area. The FPGA-based implementation of the computing resource associated to VLD-2 instruction is subsequently presented. When mapped on an ACEX EP1K100 FPGA from Altera, VLD-2 exhibits a latency of 8 TriMedia cycles, and uses all the Electronic Array Blocks and 51% of the logic cells of the device. The simulation results indicate that the VLD-2-based entropy decoder is 43% faster than its pure software counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106680","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106680.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPEG-compliant entropy decoding on FPGA-augmented TriMedia/CPU64","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"MPEG-compliant entropy decoding on FPGA-augmented TriMedia/CPU64","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106680/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7510400","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPEG-compliant entropy decoding on FPGA-augmented TriMedia/CPU64","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097181S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8168","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"24313","articleId":"1106680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1106681,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Due to the architecture a very high parallelism between the modules can be achieved Two programmable devices on each module are supported by the on-board programming and test unit, which provides in-circuit programming by the host during operation. As a result the accelerator delivers a high performance and flexibility without introducing a complex interface or handling.

Usage of this systolic architecture class has not been widespread in the past, in part because programmable hardware that supported this computing paradigm was not cost-effective to build and no design tools existed. However, suitable hardware has begun to appear. Complex FPGAs now provide an adequate level of speed, density and programmability in the form of reconfigurable computers, boards, and chips with embedded computational support. Such hardware could allow rapid implementation and change of systolic algorithms leading to inexpensive \"programmable\" systolic array hardware. Furthermore, the architectural characteristics of much FPGA hardware matches that required by systolic processing, because this technology is constructed from tiling identical memory and logic blocks along with supporting mesh interconnection networks. The symbolic parallel algorithm development environment (SPADE) described here is being developed to allow a designer to easily and rapidly explore the design space of various systolic algorithm implementations so that FPGA system tradeoffs can be efficiently analyzed. The intention is to allow a user to specify his algorithm with traditional high-level code, set some architectural constraints and then view the results in a meaningful graphical format.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106692","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106692.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic latency-optimal design of FPGA-based systolic arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1106692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106692/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic latency-optimal design of FPGA-based systolic arrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7510412","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106692/","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic latency-optimal design of FPGA-based systolic arrays","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106692.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059005S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8168","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"24313","articleId":"1106692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1106693,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It integrates multiple programmable processors and blocks of reconfigurable logic onto a single chip, using a clustered architecture, similar to the one used on the M-Machine to reduce wire length and delay and allow implementation at high clock rates. The clustered architecture provides tremendous flexibility, allowing applications to exploit parallelism at whatever granularity is best-suited to the application, while the combination of reconfigurable logic and programmable processors delivers much higher performance than could be achieved through programmable processors alone. This abstract presents the results of our initial experiments in hand-mapping applications onto Amalgam. Five applications (IDCT, Rijndael encryption, nQueens, DNA sequence comparison, and image dithering) have been implemented, achieving speedups ranging from 8.7/spl times/ to 23.2/spl times/ over the performance of a single programmable cluster by using the complete resources of an Amalgam chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/8168/24313/01106697.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 10th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.2002.1106697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1106697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping algorithms to the Amalgam programmable-reconfigurable processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reconfigurable logic","Clustering algorithms","Process design","Embedded computing","Hardware","Computer architecture","Wire","Delay","Clocks","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable architectures","parallel architectures","performance evaluation","multiprocessing systems","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Amalgam","programmable-reconfigurable processor","multiple programmable processors","reconfigurable logic","single chip","clustered architecture","hand-mapping applications","programmable processors","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Mapping algorithms to the Amalgam programmable-reconfigurable processor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106697/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7510417","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping algorithms to the Amalgam programmable-reconfigurable processor","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01106697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036492S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8168","isNumber":"24313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168","xplore-issue":"24313","articleId":"1106697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1106699,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Most researchers have heretofore focused on in-memory algorithms. However as the need to tackle very large problems increases, conventional in-memory algorithms suffer from unpredictable caching and paging behavior and their performance may degrade considerably. In addition, since the region-query data structure is only part of the overall system, its consumption of large memory resources affects other parts of the system as well. Our implementation takes advantage of spatial locality in the detailed-routing process. We partition the routing space into tiles, each storing the data of objects (rectangles) that lie strictly within it. Objects that cross tile boundaries are separately stored. The data within a tile are then written out to disk, and a configurable cache is used to hold in memory the most recently visited tiles. Experimental results on large real-life routing problems show that this scheme significantly reduces memory usage with tolerable performance penalty.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2002.1106744","startPage":"36","endPage":"41","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

This has started a significant move towards the use of programmable solutions of various forms - increasingly referred to as programmable platforms. For the platform manufacturer, programmability provides higher volume to amortize design and manufacturing costs, as the same platform can be used over multiple related applications, as well as over generations of an application. For the application implementer, programmability provides a lower risk and shorter time-to-market implementation path. The flexibility provided by programmability comes with a performance and power overhead. This can be significantly mitigated by using application specific platforms, also referred to as Application Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPs). This paper details the reasons for this significant change in application implementation philosophy, provides illustrative contemporary evidence of this change, examines the space of application specific platforms, outlines fundamental problems in their development, and finally presents a methodology to deal with this changing design style.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From ASIC to ASIP: the next design discontinuity","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Although the CBC mode is the most widely used and important, achieving such high throughput was difficult because pipelining techniques cannot be applied. To reduce the propagation delays of the S-Box, the most critical function block, we developed a special circuit architecture that we call twisted-BDD, where the fanout of signals is distributed in the S-Box circuit. Our S-Box is 1.5 to 2 times faster than the conventional S-Box implementations.

This architecture is based on the combined addition and rounding (using a dual adder) and on the anticipation of the normalization step before the addition. Because the normalization is performed before the addition, it is not possible to overlap the leading-zero-anticipator with the adder. Consequently, to avoid the increase in delay we modify the design of the LZA so that the leading bits of its output are produced first and can be used to begin the normalization. Moreover, parts of the addition are also anticipated. We have estimated the delay of the resulting architecture for double-precision format, considering the load introduced by long connections, and estimate a reduction of about 15% to 20% with respect to traditional implementations of the floating-point MAF unit.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2002.1106762","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Although individual devices may have limited functionality, the true value of the system comes from the emergent behavior that arises when data from many places in the system is combined. This type of data fusion has a number of requirements, but two of the most important are: 1) synchronized time, precise enough to resolve movement in the sensed phenomenon (e.g., sound); and 2) known geographic locations, on a similar scale to the sensors' size and deployment density. However, the installation cost of a localization system with sufficient granularity is considerable, because of the large amount of effort required to deploy such a system and make all the measurements required to tune it. In this paper, we describe a system based on COTS components that incorporates our novel time synchronization and acoustic ranging techniques.

A methodology for the automatic design of concurrent failure detection circuitry for linear analog systems is discussed in this paper In contrast to previous approaches, the methodology aims at providing coverage in terms of all the circuit components while minimizing the loading overhead by reducing the number of internal circuit nodes that need to be tapped Parameter tolerances are incorporated through either statistical or mathematical analysis to determine the threshold for failure alarm. Experimental results confirm that full coverage can be attained while keeping the hardware overhead within a pre-specified budget.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2002.1106779","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Although many techniques provide effective masking of node failures on the architectural level, several trends are aggravating the reliability demands on the node level. Starting with a brief presentation of the fault tolerance properties of the time-triggered architecture TTA the corresponding support by the time-triggered protocol controller (TTPC-C) is discussed. We propose a strategy for improving these properties with respect to the anticipated new fault scenarios. It turns out that the application of BIST during node startup and before node reintegration improves system fault tolerance. Additionally a combined strategy of online BIST and error correction can efficiently protect memory. We illustrate the implementation of the proposed mechanisms. Our implementation experiences on an FPGA platform show that the involved overheads are moderate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Computer architecture","Fault tolerant systems","Electromagnetic transients","Fault detection","Real time systems","Automotive applications","Packaging","Electromagnetic interference","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","real-time systems","fault tolerant computing","error correction","field programmable gate arrays","distributed processing","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online BIST","offline BIST","system dependability","fault-tolerant distributed real-time systems","node failure masking","reliability demands","time-triggered architecture","time-triggered protocol controller","node startup","node reintegration","error correction","memory protection","FPGA platform"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2002.1106782","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

At 400 MHz, this translates to a peak arithmetic rate of 16 GFLOPS on single-precision data and 32 GOPS on 16 bit fixed-point data. The scalability of Imagine's programming model and architecture enable it to achieve such high arithmetic rates. Imagine executes applications that have been mapped to the stream programming model. The stream model decomposes applications into a set of computation kernels that operate on data streams. This mapping exposes the inherent locality and parallelism in the application, and Imagine exploits the locality and parallelism to provide a scalable architecture that supports 48 ALUs on a single chip. This paper presents the Imagine architecture and programming model in the first half and explores the scalability of the Imagine architecture in the second half.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2002.1106783","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The experimental results show a considerable decrease in the storage requirement of fault dictionaries.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106817/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106817/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7502511","conferenceDate":"18-18 Sept. 2002","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault dictionary size reduction through test response superposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault dictionary size reduction through test response superposition","confLoc":"Freiburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"01106817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04885S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8166","isNumber":"24311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8166","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"24311","articleId":"1106817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1106880,"authors":[{"name":"J.V.

Mobile robots can be considered as a particular example of telemanipulation systems, since they can be operated remotely to perform particular tasks. As an example, the inspection of underwater structures and the removal of mines are performed by mobile platforms controlled by a remote operator, which generally takes advantage only of the visual feedback provided by vision systems. In this sense, the nature and completeness of the data provided to the operator about the state of the remote system are of crucial importance for proper task execution, and it is generally accepted that a more efficient achievement of the task can be obtained by increasing the amount of data feedback and using proper MMI. In this paper, the use of a haptic interface is proposed in order to increase a user's perception of the workspace of a mobile robot. In particular, a virtual interaction force is computed on the basis of obstacles surrounding the mobile vehicle in order to prevent dangerous contacts, so that navigation tasks can be carried out with generally better performances. In addition, passivity of the overall system is taken into account, so that stability of the virtual interaction is guaranteed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1106916/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"7568986","publicationDate":"2002","conferenceDate":"17-18 Nov. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1106916/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Teleoperation of a mobile robot through haptic feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teleoperation of a mobile robot through haptic feedback","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1106916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06032S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8174","isNumber":"24332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8174","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"24332","articleId":"1106916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1107063,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

The proposed hybrid approach combines the computational efficiency of the MM analysis with the versatility and flexibility of the FE method, enabling us to accurately model the electromagnetic behavior of inductive dichroic screens. These latter are realized by periodically perforating thick metallic screens with arbitrarily shaped apertures. The electromagnetic fields in the free-space region are expanded through a complete set of Floquet modes allowing us to reduce the analysis to the single periodicity cell; a set of waveguide modes is used inside the openings, each mode is numerically determined through an FE method procedure that relies on edge elements. A spectral criterion to determine the correct ratio between the number of waveguide and Floquet modes is adopted. Samples of numerical results are shown in order to check both the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1107065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7633605","volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1107065/","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid mode-matching finite-elements approach to the analysis of thick dichroic screens with arbitrarily shaped apertures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid mode-matching finite-elements approach to the analysis of thick dichroic screens with arbitrarily shaped apertures","sourcePdf":"01107065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037062S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"21952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"21952","articleId":"1107065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
